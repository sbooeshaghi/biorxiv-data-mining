Broad-sense heritability estimates differ between the sexes for many common medical disorders, indicating that genetic architecture can be sex-dependent. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified sex-specific and sex-biased effects, where in addition to sex-specific effects on gene expression, twenty-two medical traits have sex-specific or sex-biased loci. Sex-specific genetic architecture of complex traits is also extensively documented in model organisms using genome-wide linkage or association mapping, and in gene disruption studies. The evolutionary origins of sex-specific genetic architecture and sexual dimorphism lie in the fact that males and females share most of their genetic variation yet experience different selection pressures. At the extreme is sexual antagonism, where selection on an allele acts in opposite directions between the sexes. Sexual antagonism has been repeatedly identified via a number of experimental methods in a range of different taxa. Although the molecular basis remains to be identified, mathematical models predict the maintenance of deleterious variants that experience selection in a sex-dependent manner. There are multiple mechanisms by which sexual antagonism and alleles under sex-differential selection could contribute toward the genetics of common, complex disorders. The evidence we review clearly indicates that further research into sex-dependent selection and the sex-specific genetic architecture of diseases would be rewarding. This would be aided by studies of laboratory and wild animal populations, and by modelling sex-specific effects in genome-wide association data with joint, gene-by-sex interaction tests. We predict that even sexually monomorphic diseases may harbour cryptic sex-specific genetic architecture. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that investigating sex-dependent epistasis may be especially rewarding. Finally, the prevalent nature of sex-specific genetic architecture in disease offers scope for the development of more effective, sex-specific therapies."}, {"category": "Ecology", "link": "None", "twitter": [[" 15 Nov 2013 ", 3]], "title": "Sampling principles for biodiversity study", "date": "November 14, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1.pdf", "journal": "Pre print", "authors": [["Pan", "Xubin", " Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine"]], "abstract": "Sampling is a fundamental tool in ecology and critical for biodiversity measurement.

The third principle of sampling, sum of species number, is that the sum of species number in one area and species number in another area is no less than the total species number in the two areas. The fourth principle of sampling, individual complement, is that the sum of the mathematical expectation of individual number of one or several species in the area a and that of the same one or several species in the area A-a is the total individual number N of the same one or several species in the total area A.

Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on colour pattern. The co-mimetic species H. erato and H. melpomene have parallel hybrid zones where both species undergo a change from one colour pattern form to another. We use restriction associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome wide sequence markers and use these to analyse patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data; alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly, and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ~15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the colour pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to colour pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped colour pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus.

Public genomic data allow comparative analyses, testing of new tools and genotype-phenotype association studies. Personal genomics data of unrelated individuals are available in the public domain, notably the Personal Genome Project; however, to date genomics family data and metadata are severely lacking, mainly due to cost, privacy concerns or restricted access to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Family data have a lot to offer as they allow the study of heritability, something which is impossible to do just by using unrelated individuals. \nFINDINGS: A whole family from Southern Spain decided to genotype, sequence and analyse their personal genomes making them publicly available under a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0; commonly denominated as public domain). These data include a) five 23andMe SNP chip genotype bed files, b) four raw exomes with their assorted bam files and VCF files, c) a metagenomic raw sequencing data file and d) derived data of likely phenotypes using SNPedia-derived tools. \nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first CC0 released set of genomic, phenotypic and metagenomic data for a whole family. This dataset is also unique in that it was obtained through direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Hence any ordinary citizen with enough budget and samples should be able to reproduce this experiment. We envisage this dataset to be a useful resource for a variety of applications in the personal genomics field as a) negative control data for trait association discovery, b) testing data for development of new software and c) sample data for heritability studies. We encourage prospective users to share with us derived results so that they can be added to our existing collection."}, {"category": "Molecular Biology", "link": "None", "twitter": [[" 20 Apr 2015 ", 1], [" 06 May 2014 ", 1], [" 25 Oct 2016 ", 4], [" 22 Aug 2016 ", 1], [" 04 Sep 2014 ", 1], [" 14 Nov 2013 ", 1], [" 23 Nov 2013 ", 2]], "title": "Water and the biology of *prions* and plaques", "date": "November 12, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print3.pdf", "journal": "Pre print", "authors": [["Steel", "Graham K", " n/a"], ["Wiggins", "Phillippa M", " University of Auckland"], ["n/a", "n/a", " n/a"]], "abstract": "This is an attempt to account for the insolubility and/or aggregation of prions and plaques in terms of a model of water consisting of an equilibrium between high\ndensity and low density microdomains.

Notably, very little is known about the genetic and physiological features underlying the female response to sexual selection pressures. By combining an experimental evolution approach with genomic techniques, we investigated the effects of single and multiple matings on female fecundity and gene expression. We experimentally manipulated the mating system in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster by removing sexual selection, with the aim of testing differences in short term post-mating effects of females evolved under different mating strategies. We show that monogamous females suffer decreased fecundity, a decrease that was partially recovered by experimentally reversing the selection pressure back to the ancestral promiscuous state. The post-mating gene expression profiles of monogamous females differ significantly from promiscuous females, involving 9% of the genes tested. These transcripts are active in several tissues, mainly ovaries, neural tissues and midgut, and are involved in metabolic processes, reproduction and signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate how the female post-mating response can evolve under different mating systems, and provide novel insights into the genes targeted by sexual selection in females, by identifying a list of candidate genes responsible for the decrease in female fecundity in the absence of promiscuity."}, {"category": "Genomics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1148", "twitter": [[" 15 Nov 2013 ", 1], [" 14 Nov 2013 ", 8]], "title": "A genome wide dosage suppressor network reveals genetic robustness and a novel mechanism for Huntington\u2019s disease", "date": "November 12, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research1.pdf", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "authors": [["Patra", "Biranchi", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Kon", "Yoshiko", " University of Rochester School of Medicine"], ["Yadav", "Gitanjali", " 3National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), India"], ["Sevold", "Anthony", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Frumkin", "Jesse P", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Vallabhajosyula", "Ravishankar R", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Hintze", "Arend", " Keck Graduate Institute & Michigan State University"], ["\u00d8stman", "Bj\u00f8rn", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Schossau", "Jory", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Bhan", "Ashish", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Marzolf", "Bruz", " Institute for Systems Biology"], ["Tamashiro", "Jenna K", " Keck Graduate Institute"], ["Kaur", "Amardeep", " Institute for Systems Biology"], ["Baliga", "Nitin S", " Institute for Systems Biology"], ["Grayhack", "Elizabeth J", " University of Rochester School of Medicine"], ["Adami", "Christoph", " Keck Graduate Institute & Michigan State University"], ["Galas", "David J", " Institute for Systems Biology & Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research Institute"], ["Raval", "Alpan", " Keck Graduate Institute & School of Mathematical Sciences at Claremont Graduate University"], ["Phizicky", "Eric M", " University of Rochester School of Medicine"], ["Ray", "Animesh", " Keck Graduate Institute"]], "abstract": "Mutational robustness is the extent to which an organism has evolved to withstand the effects of deleterious mutations.

This collection has several distinctive features, including high co-occurrence of mutant-suppressor pairs within protein modules, highly correlated functions between the pairs, and higher diversity of functions among the co-suppressors than previously observed.  Dosage suppression of essential genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits and chromosome cohesion complex suggest a surprising degree of functional plasticity of macromolecular complexes and the existence of degenerate pathways for circumventing potentially lethal mutations.

To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5\u00b0C and 32.5\u00b0C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes 33 hours at 17.5\u00b0C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5\u00b0C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5\u00b0C and have drastically slowed development by 30\u00b0C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30\u00b0C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5\u00b0C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all of the species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection in response to the thermal environment in which each species lives."}, {"category": "Bioinformatics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-398", "twitter": [[" 12 Nov 2013 ", 4], [" 15 Nov 2013 ", 1]], "title": "Functional Annotation Signatures of Disease Susceptibility Loci Improve SNP Association Analysis", "date": "November 11, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics1.pdf", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "authors": [["Iversen", "Edwin S", " Duke University"], ["Lipton", "Gary", " Duke University"], ["Clyde", "Merlise A.", " Duke University"], ["Monteiro", "Alvaro N.
