Broad-sense heritability estimates differ between the sexes for many common medical disorders, indicating that genetic architecture can be sex-dependent. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified sex-specific and sex-biased effects, where in addition to sex-specific effects on gene expression, twenty-two medical traits have sex-specific or sex-biased loci. Sex-specific genetic architecture of complex traits is also extensively documented in model organisms using genome-wide linkage or association mapping, and in gene disruption studies. The evolutionary origins of sex-specific genetic architecture and sexual dimorphism lie in the fact that males and females share most of their genetic variation yet experience different selection pressures. At the extreme is sexual antagonism, where selection on an allele acts in opposite directions between the sexes. Sexual antagonism has been repeatedly identified via a number of experimental methods in a range of different taxa. Although the molecular basis remains to be identified, mathematical models predict the maintenance of deleterious variants that experience selection in a sex-dependent manner. There are multiple mechanisms by which sexual antagonism and alleles under sex-differential selection could contribute toward the genetics of common, complex disorders. The evidence we review clearly indicates that further research into sex-dependent selection and the sex-specific genetic architecture of diseases would be rewarding. This would be aided by studies of laboratory and wild animal populations, and by modelling sex-specific effects in genome-wide association data with joint, gene-by-sex interaction tests. We predict that even sexually monomorphic diseases may harbour cryptic sex-specific genetic architecture. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that investigating sex-dependent epistasis may be especially rewarding. Finally, the prevalent nature of sex-specific genetic architecture in disease offers scope for the development of more effective, sex-specific therapies."}, {"category": "Ecology", "link": "None", "twitter": [[" 15 Nov 2013 ", 3]], "title": "Sampling principles for biodiversity study", "date": "November 14, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1.pdf", "journal": "Pre print", "authors": [["Pan", "Xubin", " Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine"]], "abstract": "Sampling is a fundamental tool in ecology and critical for biodiversity measurement. However, basic principles of biodiversity sampling have been overlooked for many years. In this paper, I proposed and explored five principles of sampling for a specific area and biodiversity study. The first principle of sampling, species increasing with area, is that the number of species increases with the area. The second principle of sampling, individuals increasing with area, is that the number of individuals increases with the area. The third principle of sampling, sum of species number, is that the sum of species number in one area and species number in another area is no less than the total species number in the two areas. The fourth principle of sampling, individual complement, is that the sum of the mathematical expectation of individual number of one or several species in the area a and that of the same one or several species in the area A-a is the total individual number N of the same one or several species in the total area A. The fifth principle of sampling, species-area theory, is that the sum of the mathematical expectation of number of species in the area a and that of number of species lost if area A-a is cleared is the total species number M in the total area A."}, {"category": "Genomics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087782", "twitter": [[" 11 Dec 2013 ", 1], [" 13 Nov 2013 ", 2], [" 18 Dec 2013 ", 2]], "title": "On the Reproducibility of TCGA Ovarian Cancer MicroRNA Profiles", "date": "November 13, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE1.pdf", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "authors": [["Wan", "Ying-Wooi", " Baylor College of Medicine"], ["Mach", "Claire", " University of Houston"], ["Allen", "Genevera I.", " Rice University"], ["Anderson", "Matthew", " Baylor College of Medicine"], ["Liu", "Zhandong", " Baylor College of Medicine"]], "abstract": "Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression is a well-established feature of human cancer. However, the role of specific miRNAs in determining cancer outcomes remains unclear.

We also identified 12 miRNAs that are associated with survival when miRNAs were profiled in the same specimens using Next Generation Sequencing (miRNA-Seq) (p<0.01). Surprisingly, only 1 miRNA transcript is associated with ovarian cancer survival in both datasets. Our analyses indicate that this discrepancy is due to the fact that miRNA levels reported by the two platforms correlate poorly, even after correcting for potential issues inherent to signal detection algorithms.

Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on colour pattern. The co-mimetic species H. erato and H. melpomene have parallel hybrid zones where both species undergo a change from one colour pattern form to another. We use restriction associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome wide sequence markers and use these to analyse patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data; alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly, and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ~15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the colour pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to colour pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped colour pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify within our sample a new cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti."}, {"category": "Genomics", "link": "None", "twitter": [[" 29 Jun 2014 ", 1], [" 15 Nov 2013 ", 6], [" 16 Sep 2017 ", 1], [" 06 Mar 2017 ", 1], [" 26 Nov 2016 ", 2], [" 15 Dec 2016 ", 3], [" 14 Dec 2016 ", 4], [" 14 Nov 2013 ", 9]], "title": "A Complete Public Domain Family Genomics Dataset", "date": "November 12, 2013", "text": "/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2.pdf", "journal": "Pre print", "authors": [["Corpas", "Manuel", " Independent"], ["Cariaso", "Mike", " SNPedia"], ["Coletta", "Alain", " InSilicoDB"], ["Weiss", "David", " InSilicoDB"], ["Harrison", "Andrew P", " University of Essex"], ["Moran", "Federico", " Universidad Complutense de Madrid"], ["Yang", "Huanming", " BGI"]], "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The availability of open access genomic data is essential for the personal genomics field. Public genomic data allow comparative analyses, testing of new tools and genotype-phenotype association studies. Personal genomics data of unrelated individuals are available in the public domain, notably the Personal Genome Project; however, to date genomics family data and metadata are severely lacking, mainly due to cost, privacy concerns or restricted access to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Family data have a lot to offer as they allow the study of heritability, something which is impossible to do just by using unrelated individuals. \nFINDINGS: A whole family from Southern Spain decided to genotype, sequence and analyse their personal genomes making them publicly available under a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0; commonly denominated as public domain). These data include a) five 23andMe SNP chip genotype bed files, b) four raw exomes with their assorted bam files and VCF files, c) a metagenomic raw sequencing data file and d) derived data of likely phenotypes using SNPedia-derived tools. \nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first CC0 released set of genomic, phenotypic and metagenomic data for a whole family. This dataset is also unique in that it was obtained through direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Hence any ordinary citizen with enough budget and samples should be able to reproduce this experiment. We envisage this dataset to be a useful resource for a variety of applications in the personal genomics field as a) negative control data for trait association discovery, b) testing data for development of new software and c) sample data for heritability studies. We encourage prospective users to share with us derived results so that they can be added to our existing collection."}]}
