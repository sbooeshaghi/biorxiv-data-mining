So far, it has not been possible to perform advanced microscopy on pool generated strain
libraries and at the same time know each strain’s genotype. We have overcome this barrier by
identifying the genotypes for individual cells​ in situ​ after a detailed characterization of the
phenotype. The principle is demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence imaging of ​E. coli
strains harboring barcoded plasmids that express a sgRNA which suppress different genes
through dCas9.
Recent years have seen a rapid development in genome engineering, which, in combination with
decreased costs for DNA oligonucleotide synthesis, have made it possible to design and produce pool
generated cell libraries with overwhelming genetic diversity 1–6​
​ . A similarly impressive development in
microscopy enables the investigation of complex phenotypes at high temporal resolution and spatial
precision in living cells 7,8​
​ . Finally, developments in microfluidics have enabled well controlled single
cell observations of individual strains over many generations 9​​ . Despite the rapid technological
progress within these areas, there is currently no efficient technique for sensitive time-resolved
phenotyping of pool generated libraries of genetically different cell strains. Recent work observing
multiple bacterial strains on agarose pads allows for sensitive microscopy 10,11​
​ , but the genetic
diversity is capped since the strain production and handling is not pooled. On the other end, droplet
fluidics allow working with large genetic diversity 1​​ , but cannot be used to characterize phenotypes
that require sensitive time lapse imaging.
Our solution is composed of three key components: (1) construction of a barcoded strain library, (2)
live cell phenotyping in a microfluidic device where each strain occupies a defined position and (3) ​in
situ genotyping to identify which strain is in which position (Fig. 1). Phenotyping is here used as a
general description for any of the time-resolved biochemical assays that are possible with time-lapse
microscopy in individual cells. We refer to the method as DuMPLING - Dynamic u-fluidic Microscopy
based Phenotyping of a Library before IN situ Genotyping.

or chromosomal promoter variants. (2) Live cell phenotyping using fluorescence microscopy to e.g.
identify changes in protein localization, diffusion, or kinetics. (3) Genotypes recovered by ​in situ
genotyping using e.g. FISH or ​in situ​ sequencing.

Each component has previously been successfully developed and can be performed in many different
ways. For example, one can make pooled dCas9 libraries based on plasmids harboring both a
genotype-identifying barcode and a sgRNA gene ​1–5 for labeling genetic loci ​12 or knocking
down/activating genes throughout the chromosome. Alternatively, pooled chromosomal libraries with
variants of promoters, ribosome binding sites or coding sequences 6,13
​ can be made. Similarly, single
cell time courses have been obtained with high sensitivity in dedicated microfluidic devices 8,14–17​
​

18,19
method for identifying the barcode can be based on ​in situ sequencing ​
or sequential probing using
​

fluorescence ​in situ​ hybridization (FISH) 20,21​
To exemplify the use of DuMPLING, we targeted different components of the ​lac operon in ​E. coli
using a set of sgRNA-expressing plasmids that repressed ​lacI​, lacY or an unrelated gene (Fig. 2A).
The plasmids are made from pooled oligos including the sgRNA and its unique barcode. The pooled
approach has previously been used to generate libraries of thousands of genotypes 1,3​
​ , but here we
limit to three variants to be able to precisely evaluate the accuracy of each step. The mixed plasmids
are electroporated into an ​E. coli strain, where dCas9 is expressed from a regulated chromosomal
promoter. Furthermore, the ​lacY ​gene is fused with the gene for the fluorescent protein YPet to obtain
an easily detectable phenotype.
The mixed strains are loaded into a microfluidic chip which harbours 2000 cell channels, sustains
continuous exponential growth, and allows single cell imaging for days (Fig 2B). After a few
generations, all cells in a channel are the progeny of the cell at the back of the channel and thus
share the same genotype. The chip design is similar to the mother machine 9​​ , but we have introduced
a 300 nm opening in the back of each cell channel such that media and reagents can be passed over
the cells. In our experiments, 233 channels are imaged every 60 seconds using phase contrast and
every 13 minutes using single molecule sensitive wide field fluorescence for a total of 272 minutes.
Phase contrast images are used for cell detection and lineage tracking. Individual LacY-YPet
molecules, detected using wide field epifluorescence, are overlaid on the phase contrast images to
allow assignment of individual molecules to individual cells. At this point the phenotypes are only
associated to the spatial position in the chip (i.e., the channel the cells are in), since the genotype of
the cells is not yet known.
Each plasmid expresses a unique RNA-based barcode that allows genotype identification. The
barcode is expressed from a T7 promoter, and the T7 polymerase is under control of an inducible
arabinose promoter. The orthogonal and inducible nature of this system prevents it from interfering
with cell growth before induction (Fig. S3). The cells are fixed ​in situ with formaldehyde and
permeabilized before FISH. The individual barcodes are identified by sequential hybridization of
fluorescent 37 base long oligonucleotides (probes). The multiplexed process of designing and
producing the probe library is described in the Supplementary Methods. We use probes of two
different colors (C=2) in two sequential rounds of probing (N=2), which is sufficient for identifying the 3
genotypes in this study. In general, C​N genotypes can be identified. To demonstrate that it is possible
to reprobe many times, we perform N=6 consecutive rounds (Fig. 2C) of probing in each position.
Extending to C=4 colors without significant bleedthrough based on currently available dyes is
common practice 19​
​ , and therefore it is possible, without significant additional engineering, to uniquely
encode and identify >4000 strains.

In Fig. 2D we show the distribution of the number of LacY-YPet detected per cell in individual frames
for the different genotypes. As a control for correct genotype to phenotype assignments we note that
all strains that express a high level of LacY-YPet have been correctly found to express the barcode
RNA associated with the sgRNA against ​lacI and that all strains with the barcode RNA associated
with the sgRNA against ​lacI express high levels of LacY-YPet. As a demonstration of single molecule
sensitivity in the phenotyping, we note that we can reproducibly measure mean expression of less
than one YPet molecule per generation and distinguish a less than 3x change at this expression level
(2D ​inset​, Fig. S6). We also demonstrate the dynamic capability by plotting an example cell lineage
tree that spans 6 generations and the full time course of the experiment (Fig. 2E).
This brief communication describes a proof of principle application of the DuMPLING concept, i.e. the
possibility to phenotype a pool generated library of cells and then genotype ​in situ​. The advantage of
our method compared to the state of the art is the combination of pooled handling of library generation
and characterization of complex phenotypes based on dynamic changes in single cells. We have here
restricted ourselves to a small CRISPRi application with bacteria in a fluidic device, but the dumpling
can have many other fillings.

Abstract
Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But, it is unclear how attentional
focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation - acoustic frequency - might modulate
basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective
attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil
dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This
makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory
attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish that
human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonicallyestimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically-mapped non-primary auditory
cortex. The attentionally-driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensorydriven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in
non-auditory areas. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when
best frequency is attended, versus ignored. Moreover, the single frequency bands that evoke
the least activation and the frequency bands that elicit the least activation when attention is
directed to them also correspond closely. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial
correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal
across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across
tonotopically-mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R1-estimated myeloarchitecture,
indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory
regionalization.

Significance
Perception is an active process especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory
attention to track a violin’s melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a
crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrallydirected auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human
primary and non-primary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally-directed attention
in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation
profiles evoked by single frequency bands are correlated with attentionally-driven activation
when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong
concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across
several auditory cortical regions.

Introduction

Listeners shift attention across multiple simultaneously-present acoustic dimensions to home in
on those that are diagnostic in guiding behavior (Idemaru and Holt, 2011; Herrmann and Henry,
2013; Shamma and Fritz, 2014). In nonhuman animal studies task-based spectral attention
adaptively modulates auditory neurons’ spectrotemporal response fields (Fritz et al., 2010).
Human neuroimaging results reveal that attention to streams of high- versus low-frequency
acoustic input can modulate activity in tonotopically-defined regions (Paltoglou et al., 2009), as
can imagery that evokes higher versus lower frequencies (Oh et al., 2013). In and directly
around Heschl’s gyrus, there are strong frequency-band-specific attentional effects to high and
low pure-tone streams presented to opposite ears (Da Costa et al., 2013) and a shared
topography of sensory and attentionally-driven responses (Riecke et al., 2016). These results
establish that endogenous attention directed across acoustic frequency, the primary axis of
auditory representation, can modulate human cortical activity in a tonotopic manner around
Heschl’s gyrus. But, there remain important unanswered questions about the neurobiological
basis of human spectrally-directed attention.
First, does human primary auditory cortex exhibit attentionally-driven tonotopic organization?
Non-human animal physiology establishes spectrally-directed attention in myelo- and cytoarchitectonically-defined primary areas in ‘auditory core’ (Fritz et al., 2007b; Shamma and Fritz,
2014). However, although two recent neuroimaging studies have shown strong similarities
between stimulus- and attentionally-driven tonotopic organization in and directly around
Heschl’s gyrus (Da Costa et al., 2013; Riecke et al., 2016), it has not yet been possible to
unambiguously localize this effect to human auditory core. Here, we use high-resolution
quantitative MRI to estimate myelo-architectonically-defined auditory core, and demonstrate that
spectrally-directed attention modulates its activation in a tonotopically-organized manner.
Second, is attentionally-driven tonotopic organization present outside of auditory core? In
humans, (Riecke et al., 2016) found no significant evidence for tonotopically organized effects of
spectral attention outside of early auditory areas, but did show that the information content of
non-primary cortical frequency representations was sufficient for above-chance decoding of
listeners’ frequency-selective attentional focus. The lack of attentionally-driven tonotopic
mapping contrasts with the finding that most non-primary cortical visual areas exhibit strong
retinotopically-specific attentional effects (Saygin and Sereno, 2008)). Using intensive data
collection (>7000 functional volumes per subject) we present evidence for widespread,
tonotopically-organized modulation by spectral attention across much of auditory cortex, with
individual differences in individual participants' tonotopic maps reproduced in attentionally-driven
maps.
Third, what is the effect of when frequency-selective attention is directed to a voxel's nonpreferred frequency band? Detailed fMRI studies of stimulus-driven frequency response
functions (Schönwiesner and Zatorre, 2009; Moerel et al., 2013) have shown graded and multipeaked frequency responses across human auditory cortex. However, it is unclear whether
these more complex patterns are recapitulated by attention to a given frequency band. In the
context of three distinct frequency bands, (Riecke et al., 2016) found that attentional filters

appeared to be bandpass in and around Heschl’s gyrus. Here, using a five-frequency-band
paradigm, we establish that graded response profiles evoked by single frequency bands are
strongly associated with attentionally-driven response profiles to those frequencies across much
of auditory cortex. We also show that a systematic topography of ‘dis-preferred’ frequency can
be driven by attention, and establish the regionalization of spectral attentional effects relative to
prior studies of crossmodal auditory attention (Petkov et al., 2004).
Finally, is there spatial correspondence between auditory cortical anatomy, as measured by the
local change in R1-estimated myelination, and the strength of the fMRI-assessed strength of
relative frequency selectivity? Post-mortem Gallyas staining to establish human
myeloarchitecture reveals considerable variability in auditory cortical myelination that is
associated with MRI signal change in the same brain (Wallace et al., 2016). Likewise, variation
in cortical myelination estimated using T1/T2 ratio approaches also appears to correspond
spatially with some functional variation in the superior temporal lobe (Glasser et al., 2016).
Here, we demonstrate that there is spatial concordance between the degree of myelination and
the amplitude of the frequency-selective tonotopic signal across several regions in auditory
cortex.
Methods
Experiment Overview. We used a novel paradigm in which listeners direct attention to a series
of four-tone ‘mini-sequences’ that fall within one of five possible spectral bands, without any
spatial cues. The task is to monitor for temporally-adjacent mini-sequence repeats within the
attended band. Inasmuch as this places a very high demand on encoding and integrating
spectral sequences within a delimited frequency range, we expect it to be especially effective in
evoking strong responses in non-primary auditory cortical areas. The goal is to address where,
specifically, in the auditory system spectral gain from attention is evident, and akin to longstanding work in vision (Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000), to delineate the topographic maps
across which attentional modulation is apparent.
The target mini-sequences were embedded in either an informationally-sparse or
informationally-dense acoustic scene (Figure (Fig.) 1). Streams of four-tone mini-sequences
were presented in either a single band [‘tonotopy’, Fig. 1a], or accompanied by mini-sequences
in a ‘distractor’ frequency band, the center frequency of which varied in the frequency distance
from the attended band across blocks [‘attention-tonotopy’, abbreviated 'attn-tono', Fig. 1b]. A
verbal cue directed listeners’ attention to a specific frequency band, within which listeners
monitored four-tone mini-sequences for repeats; the ‘distractor’ band in attn-tono blocks also
contained repeats. Using a discretized version of a phase-encoded fMRI design (Sereno et al.,
1995; Schwarzkopf et al., 2011; Rao:2005fn; Herdener et al., 2013; Langers et al., 2014), the
cued frequency band stepped up or down in orderly steps across the acoustic spectrum across
a 64-sec cycle [Fig. 1c]. Phase-encoded tonotopic designs benefit from the power and
robustness of the 'travelling wave' method for topographic cortical mapping (Engel, 2012); the
discretized (blocked) version we use here has the advantage of being able to be analyzed using
both Fourier and regression approaches. This allowed us to include an additional, ‘randomized’
attn-tono condition that contributed both as a control condition in Fourier analyses, and also as

Figure 1. Stimuli and design overview. (A) In a representative 12.8s Tonotopy block a neutral verbal
prompt “hear” precedes 14 four-tone mini-sequences sampled around one of 5 center frequencies. The
task is to detect the 1-3 mini-sequence repeats embedded within the block. The grey box highlights a
single mini-sequence repeat. (B) A single Attention-Tonotopy (Attn-tono) block includes two
simultaneous streams of mini-sequences with distinct center frequencies. Mini-sequence repeats occur
in each stream. A verbal prompt (“high” or “low”) directs listeners to attend to one stream and report
mini-sequence repeats in that stream, while ignoring repeats in the unattended stream. Two randomlyordered orientation tones at the center frequency of each stream alert listeners to the frequency
neighborhood of the upcoming streams. (C) A single 64s cycle of Stepped Attn-tono blocks includes
five 12.8s blocks that step up (shown), or down, in center frequency. In this single cycle, the frequency
band to which attention is directed by the verbal prompt (indicated with “high”/”low” above each block) is
acoustically matched with the Tonotopy cycle shown in (B), but there are always competing unattended
mini-sequences in a distinct frequency band. (D) A single 64s cycle of Randomized Attn-tono blocks
is acoustically identical to the Stepped Attn-tono cycle in (C), except that half of the verbal prompts have
been swapped, and therefore no longer cue attention to frequency with consistent phase lags. (E) The
distinction between Stepped and Randomized Attn-tono blocks is highlighted by examining the first
three (of eight) cycles of a Stepped (top) versus Randomized (bottom) Attn-tono run The focus of
attention is color coded in the frequency-band-specific manner shown in (A). For the Stepped condition
(top), there is a consistent relationship between the stimulus phase lag and the attended frequency
across cycles within a run. Thus, for voxels that show a consistently higher response at one attended
frequency band compared to all others, there will be a periodic response at 8 cycles/run at a given
phase lag corresponding to the particular frequency band attended. For the Randomized condition
(bottom), there is no consistent relationship, providing a control condition for Fourier analyses because
frequency-band-directed attention is aperiodic across a run. (F) The stimulus phase lag with the highest
periodic BOLD signal amplitude is determined for each voxel, mapped to the color wheel, and then
painted onto the cortical surface patch. BOLD signal amplitude is mapped to the color’s saturation.
(Note: In these panels A-D, stimulus intensity is adjusted across the spectrum to aid visual presentation
of energy across frequency bands. See Methods for details on actual intensity across frequency bands).

an additional attn-tono run in regression analyses (see Fig.1d). The tone stimuli from this
condition were identical to the ‘stepped’ attn-tono condition, but the order of the verbal cues
directing listeners’ attention to a specific frequency band was scrambled in their assignment to
blocks. This preserved the acoustics across conditions, but eliminated the consistent ‘stepping’
of attention through the frequency spectrum in the randomized condition thereby destroying the
consistent phase-lag associated with specific frequency bands that support Fourier analyses
[schematized in Fig. 1e, and see below]. Thus, to the extent that there are attentionally-driven
frequency-selective maps in auditory cortex we expect tonotopically-organized attentional maps
to be apparent in the 'stepped,' but not the 'randomized' attention-o-tonotopy conditions under
Fourier analyses. In contrast, regression analyses include a model of attention, allowing
‘stepped’ and ‘randomized’ attn-tono conditions to be pooled to investigate the impact of
attention on cortical activation. Across both Fourier and regression analyses, the ‘stepped’ attntono conditions were collapsed across runs for which the cued frequency band stepped up in
frequency and those that stepped down; inclusion of each simply balanced the directional
movement of attention through the acoustic spectrum across the experiment.
In summary, in the attn-tono condition, attention alone was available to differentially drive
responses to an approximately constant acoustic input, whereas in the tonotopy condition,
responses were driven by spectrally-selective stimuli as well as by attention.
We analyzed mapping data using Fourier methods with individual and surface-based group
analysis methods, as described previously (Sereno et al., 1995; Hagler et al., 2006; 2007). With
this approach, voxels preferentially responding to a certain phase in a ‘stepped’ stimulus cycle
are defined as those that have a significantly higher signal amplitude at this stimulus temporal
frequency (meaning the slow frequency of the repeat of the spectral ramp) than at the average
of other 'noise' frequencies (see Fig. 1e). Significant signal phases (a particular position in the
cycle) are then mapped to a color wheel to indicate the voxel’s ‘best frequency’ and signal
amplitude is mapped to the voxel’s color saturation (Fig. 1f). We time-reversed runs stepping
down in frequency and averaged them with runs stepping up in frequency (Sereno et al., 1995;
Talavage et al., 2004; Dick et al., 2012; Ahveninen et al., 2016). Cross-subject averaging of
phase-encoded mapping data was performed using a method described previously (Hagler et
al., 2007) in which the real and imaginary components of the signal with respect to the stepped
cycle were sampled to the cortical surface and then averaged across subjects, preserving any
phase information that was coherent over subjects.
Using previously established methods (Dick et al., 2012; Sereno et al., 2013; Lutti et al., 2014)
see also (Glasser et al., 2016)), we used high-resolution quantitative multiparameter imaging to
generate maps of estimated cortical myelination based on longitudinal relaxation times
(quantitative T1). Recent work by multiple labs supports the hypothesis that T1 relaxation is
reliably associated with quantitative differences in myelination in white matter and cortex
(Sereno et al., 2013; Callaghan et al., 2014; Stüber et al., 2014; Dinse et al., 2015; Tardif et al.,
2015; Turner, 2015; Tardif et al., 2016).
Here, we calculated each subject’s R1 (1/T1) values,
where the greater the R1, the higher the inferred myelin content. These R1 values were
resampled onto his or her surface at a cortical depth fraction of 0.5, and also averaged across

individuals using sulcus-aligned cortical-surface-based procedures (see below for further
details).
Participants. Eight adults (aged 23-45 y, mean 28 y; 6 female) participated; none reported a
history of neurological disease or communication disorders. All had some childhood and/or adult
musical training (one had a music degree), and had previous experience with longer scanning
sessions. While musical training seemed to facilitate learning the experimental task, subsequent
behavioral studies in the lab have shown that musically-naive subjects can also attain excellent
performance with similar levels of training on this and even more demanding related tasks.
Stimuli and Design. Stimuli were created using custom code in Matlab version 2015a
(Mathworks, Inc.) and SoX version 14.4.2 (sourceforge.net). The basic stimulus unit was a fourtone mini-sequence (140 ms sine-wave tones including 10 ms linear amplitude ramp), with each
tone drawn with replacement from a seven-semitone, band-delimited pool centered around one
of five frequencies (300, 566, 1068, 2016, 3805 Hz; Fig. 1a). Fourteen mini-sequences formed a
block (mean inter-sequence silent interval 240 ms, SD 10 ms). Each block contained one to
three mini-sequence repeats (1:2:1 ratio of 1, 2, and 3 repeats). When there was more than one
repeat per block, mini-sequence repeat pairs were separated by at least one intervening minisequence. Each block began with a verbal prompt: ‘hear’, ‘high’, or ‘low’; loudness-equalized
Mac ‘Victoria’ voice, mean duration 506 ms (SD 36 ms), padded with silence to 800 ms total
duration. This prompt was followed by 800 ms silent gap (tonotopy) or tone-cue (attn-tono), then
the 14 mini-sequences (11.2s in total), for a total block duration of 12.8s.
The task was to detect mini-sequence repeats in the attended frequency band (i.e., a 1-back
task). In the tonotopy condition, mini-sequences were confined to a single frequency band
preceded by the neutral verbal prompt ‘hear’ (Fig. 1a). In two of the four single-band tonotopy
runs, block center frequency was stepped from low-to-high over a 64-second cycle with 8
cycles/run; step direction was reversed (high-to-low) for the other two runs. This is a ‘discrete’
version of phase-encoded designs commonly used in visual, somatosensory, and auditory
mapping studies (Engel et al., 1994; Sereno et al., 1995; Da Costa et al., 2011; Dick et al.,
2012; Langers and van Dijk, 2012; Langers et al., 2014; Saenz and Langers, 2014).
The attn-tono condition had the exact mini-sequence patterns from the tonotopy blocks, but
there also were simultaneous, competing mini-sequences in a distinct frequency band with a
center frequency at least 14 semitones apart (Fig. 1b; 300 vs. 1068 Hz; 300 vs. 2016 Hz; 300
vs. 3805 Hz; 566 vs. 2016 Hz; 566 vs. 3805 Hz; 1068 vs. 3805 Hz; not all center frequencies
were paired due to the 14-semitone constraint). The verbal prompt (high or low) initiating each
attn-tono block signaled participants to perform the 1-back task on either the higher or lower
frequency band. Immediately after the verbal prompt, a randomly-ordered pair of sine-wave
tones cued the center frequencies of the upcoming block (140 ms tones including 8 ms linear
on/off amplitude ramp; 26 ms inter-tone silence, tone pair followed by 494 ms silence, total
duration 800 ms). Crucially, there were mini-sequence repeats even in the unattended band to
assure that attention directed to the task was endogenously driven rather than being attracted
by stimulus repetition effects (Barascud et al., 2016).

There were two attn-tono conditions: ‘stepped’ and ‘randomized’. Analogous to single-band
tonotopy runs, in stepped attn-tono runs the verbally-cued frequency band implicitly stepped up
(2 runs) or down (2 runs) in frequency over a 64-sec cycle (Fig. 1c). This cued iterative stepping
through the frequency spectrum facilitates transfer of attention to each frequency band (as in
traditional phase-encoded designs) and supports Fourier approaches to analysis (Fig. 1e). Each
randomized attn-tono run was acoustically identical to a stepped run, but the verbal prompt was
manipulated so that there was no systematic, stepped organization of mini-sequence center
frequencies through the spectrum (Fig. 1d). For this condition, frequency bands were cued at
inconsistent phase lags within the 8 cycles/run, thereby phase-canceling any periodic attentional
response; this is schematized in Fig 1e. This randomized-order control is important, as there is
a small (~1 octave) overall shift in spectral mean over the course of an attn-tono stimulus cycle
that is unavoidable due to the constraints on the pairing of frequency bands.
Each of the twelve 9.6-minute-long runs was composed of eight 64s cycles plus 32-sec silent
periods at the beginning and end of each run to allow for calculation of baseline auditory
activation (Klein et al., 2014).
Behavioral Thresholds and Training. Participants first underwent behavioral tests of monaural
pure-tone thresholds and binaural thresholds for detecting mini-sequences in quiet and in
acoustic noise generated by the MRI scanner running the multiband EPI sequence. This
provided a basis for adjusting center frequency amplitudes to approximate equal loudness in
scanner noise. Participants also trained on the mini-sequence detection task in quiet and in
acoustic scanner noise across two sessions.
Imaging Data Acquisition. Structural and functional images were acquired on a 3-Tesla
Siemens Verio wide-bore MRI scanner at the Scientific Imaging and Brain Research (SIBR)
Center at Carnegie Mellon University using a phased array 32-channel head coil across three
scan sessions on separate days. Stimulus presentation was under the control of a MacPro
running PsychToolbox 3.0.12 in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.), with audio output to an external
AD/DA converter (Babyface, RME) connected to an amplifier (Pylepro) that delivered stimuli to
participants in the scanner diotically over MRI-compatible earbuds (Sensimetrics S14). All
stimuli were pre-filtered to equalize sound stimuli according to the earbuds’ frequency response.
After participants were settled into the bore, sound volume was adjusted so that participants
could comfortably hear all frequencies through scanner noise. Participants wore a fiber optic
response glove (Current Designs) that communicated with a Brain Logics I/O device
(Psychology Software Tools, Inc); participants used the glove to respond to mini-sequence
repeats using the right index finger. During all functional scans, subjects closed their eyes to
reduce the potential for stimulus-correlated eye movements.
In the initial scanning session (~50 min), we acquired multi-parameter mapping (MPM) images
for quantitative myelin mapping and structural identification of primary auditory cortex on an
individual basis while participants watched a film. Proton density-weighted (PDw), T1-weighted
(T1w), and magnetization transfer (MTw) images were acquired using an in-house 3D FLASH
pulse sequence (voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm3, matrix = 320 x 280 x 208, TR = 25.0 ms,
bandwidth 488 Hz/px, excitation flip angle: 6o (PDw/MTw) or 21o (T1w), slab rotation 30o). To

accelerate this high resolution acquisition, a partial Fourier acquisition (6/8 coverage) was used
in the inner phase-encoded direction (RL) and parallel imaging was used along the outer phase
encoding direction (AP), reconstructed using the GRAPPA algorithm (acceleration factor 2, 18
integrated auto-calibration lines) as implemented on the scanner platform. Four gradient echoes
were acquired for each contrast (TE=2.5, 4.74, 6.98, 9.22 ms) after each excitation pulse and
averaged to improve SNR (Helms et al., 2009). Each FLASH acquisition lasted 9 minutes 45
seconds. Quantitative R1 (=1/T1) maps were estimated from the PDw and T1w images
according to the model developed by Helms et al. (Helms et al., 2008) including a correction for
RF transmit field inhomogeneities (Lutti et al., 2010) and imperfect spoiling (Preibisch and
Deichmann, 2009). The transmit field map was calculated using a 3D EPI spin-echo (SE)/
stimulated echo (STE) method (Lutti et al., 2010; 2012); FOV = 256 x 192 x 192 mm, matrix =
64 x 64 x 48, TE = 53.14 ms, TM = 47.60 ms, TR = 500 ms, bandwidth = 2298, nominal α
varying from 135o to 65o in steps of 5o, acquisition time 6 minutes) and was corrected for offresonance effects using a standard B0 field map (double gradient echo FLASH, 3x3x2 mm
isotropic resolution, whole-brain coverage).
The final two scanning sessions acquired functional data for four runs each of the tonotopy,
‘stepped’ attn-tono, and ‘randomized’ attn-tono conditions. The runs were interleaved across
conditions and designed to assess phase-encoded functional influences of selective attention
across frequency (‘stepped’ attn-tono), the functional response to identical acoustics without
systematic phase encoded shifts of attention (‘randomized’ attn-tono), and functional responses
to single frequency bands identical to the attended bands in attn-tono, with phase-encoded
steps through frequency and no distractor frequency bands (tonotopy). Across all functional
runs, participants engaged in detecting repeats (1-back) of the four-tone mini-sequences. Run
order was counterbalanced according to condition and whether the cycle involved steps up or
down in frequency.
Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse
sequence (44 oblique axial slices, in plane resolution 3 mm x 3 mm, 3 mm slice thickness, no
gap, repetition time TR = 1000 ms, echo time TE = 41 ms, flip angle = 61°, matrix size = 64 x
64, field of view FOV = 192 mm). All EPI functional scans were performed using 4x multi-band
acceleration (Feinberg et al., 2010; Feinberg and Setsompop, 2013). There were 584 repetitions
acquired per run, with the first 8 images discarded to allow for longitudinal magnetization to
arrive at equilibrium. Runs were pseudo-randomly ordered across participants.
Image Preprocessing. Cortical surface creation, and mapping of R1 values. Each subject’s
cortical surface was reconstructed from a contrast-optimized synthetic FLASH volume, created
with mri_synthesize in Freesurfer from scaled and truncated versions of the T1 and protondensity volumes; another MPRAGE-weighted version was created for use with the automated
Freesurfer Talairach procedure. Both volumes were conformed to 1mm isotropic resolution and
used in a customized reconstruction pipeline version. (In particular, the subject’s PD volume
was used to deskull the synthetic FLASH image using a ‘shrink-wrap’ technique (Dale and
Sereno, 1993)). After inspection for reconstruction quality, R1 values were resampled from 50%
cortical depth fraction to the subject’s surface, and also morphed to the unit icosahedron for
cross-subject curvature-aligned cortical surface based averaging (Fischl et al., 1999).

EPI processing. Each functional image from both sessions was aligned to a reference volume
from the middle of the first run using AFNI’s 3dvolreg; registration and motion correction
goodness were hand-checked for each run. The reference volume was aligned to the subject’s
cortical surface using boundary-based registration in Freesurfer (Greve and Fischl, 2009),
verified using manual blink comparison, and applied to the volume-aligned EPI data for
resampling. EPI data were analyzed in native space without any spatial smoothing using both
Fourier and general linear methods.
Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis. As noted above, the fMRI experiment used a
'discrete' version of a traditional phase-encoded design, such that both Fourier-based and
general linear model approaches could be used. Fourier analyses were carried out in csurf
(http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/.tmp/dist/csurf) with individual and group analysis methods
employed as previously described (Sereno et al., 1995; Sereno and Huang, 2006; Hagler et al.,
2007). Functional activation amplitude was estimated as the Fourier amplitude of the periodic
BOLD signal (proportional to percent response) at the frequency of the stimulus cycle (8
repetitions per run). An F statistic was calculated by comparing that amplitude to the average
amplitude of other ‘noise’ frequencies (Hagler et al., 2007). Periodic signal components with
very low frequencies (due to slow head motion) and the second and third harmonic of the
stimulus were excluded as neither signal nor noise (this is mathematically equivalent to first
linearly regressing out these frequencies as nuisance variables before calculating significance).
The phase of the signal, which corresponds to a particular point of the stimulus cycle, was then
mapped to the color wheel and the amplitude of the signal at each vertex was mapped to color
saturation (Gouraud sharing within each face). Runs with downward frequency steps were timereversed and averaged with upward-stepped scans in order to cancel fixed voxel-specific delays
in the BOLD response.
Linear modeling was carried out in FSL (Smith et al., 2004). For all runs, the motion-registered
data were high-pass-filtered (100 sec) and prewhitened; a hemodynamic model corresponding
to each stimulated and attended (tonotopy condition) or attended (stepped, randomized attntono conditions) frequency band was created by convolving the 12.8-sec block with a gamma
function (lag 6s, SD sc). In a separate multiple regression, the unattended (ignored) frequency
band was modeled for both stepped and randomized attn-tono conditions. The verbal cue was
also modeled; all models were temporally filtered before multiple regression. Coefficients from
the first-level contrasts for each of the four runs were combined in a fixed-effects analysis for
each condition; data from the stepped and random block conditions were also combined in an
eight-run average.
Cross-subject averaging of phase-encoded mapping data was performed using the
methodology developed by Hagler and Sereno (Hagler and Sereno, 2006) in which the real and
imaginary components of the signal with respect to the stimulus ramp are averaged across
subjects, preserving any phase information consistent between subjects. This was performed by
projecting each participant’s phase-encoded map to the FreeSurfer spherical atlas using
mri_surf2surf, performing 1 step of surface-based smoothing (< 1 mm FWHM in 2D), averaging
across subjects at each vertex, then painting back onto a single subject’s surface for viewing.

For the multiple regression analyses, the same sampling process was used to sample each
subject’s contrast parameter estimates for cross-subject averaging and t-tests.
Surface-based cluster exclusion was used to correct for multiple comparisons in the groupwise
averages (surfclust and randsurfclust from (Hagler et al., 2006)). The exclusion criterion (only
surface clusters > 78 mm2 unless otherwise noted) was determined based on the minimum
estimated cortical area from iterative random sampling of cluster sizes (N=10000 iterations per
hemisphere in randsurfclust) required to achieve a corrected alpha of p < 0.001 for each
hemisphere, based on an initial uncorrected alpha of vertexwise p < 0.01.
ROI analyses: We quantified the similarity between frequency band response profiles driven by
stimulus+attention (tonotopy) versus attention alone (attn-tono) in a 'quilt' of small corticalsurface-based ROIs that tiled the temporal plane. ROIs (as seen in Fig. 4c) were created by on
a single subject's right and left hemisphere flattened patches by flooding all vertices within a
4mm radius around a central selected vertex. Each of the ROIs (57 in the right hemisphere
patch, and 68 in the slightly larger left patch) were then spherically morphed to the other 7
subjects' flattened patches. Spurious ROI sampling on the edges of the patches was manually
corrected on the original subject's inflated surface and re-morphed to all other subjects. Each
ROI was then projected into the registered native-space EPI volume using Freesurfer's
mri_label2vol (sampled from the grey-white boundary to 0.8 of the calculated cortical depth, with
fillthresh set to 0.5). For each subject, within each ROI, we calculated the average parameter
estimate for each frequency band for tonotopy, and combined stepped and randomized attntono conditions. For each ROI, we then ran a linear model with average tonotopy parameter
estimates for the 5 frequency bands predicting average attn-tono parameter estimates for the
same bands, including subjects as a random factor. The resulting partial t-statistic for each ROI
was z-transformed and color-rendered in Fig. 4c, with p-value thresholds Bonferroni-corrected
to p < 0.05 for the number of ROIs per hemisphere, and indicated by the white outline
surrounding the set of ROIs that surpass this z-threshold.

Results
Fourier-based Analyses
Stimulus- and attentionally-driven tonotopic organization in human auditory core. As a
necessary first step, we characterized basic tonotopic (stimulus-driven) organization in and
immediately around myelin-defined auditory core. The group-average R1-based estimates of
myelination (inflated hemispheres in left-most panel of Fig. 2) show that the highest R1 values
occur within primary somatomotor areas along the central sulcus, and in the typically keyholeshaped ‘auditory core’ lying along and immediately surrounding Heschl’s gyrus. Its shape is
more easily observed in the auditory cortex flat patches shown in Figure 2a-c, depicted with
isointensity R1 contours, with Heschl’s gyrus marked for reference. The group-averaged
topography of preferred frequency around auditory core has a typical arrangement (Dick et al.,
2012; De Martino et al., 2015b), with the core surrounded by a high-frequency ‘V’. Preferred
frequency descends into the center of core (where R1 values are highest) before reversing and

Figure 2. Group activation for Tonotopy and Attention-Tonotopy conditions, with R1
contours showing putative auditory core. The left-most panel shows cortical-surface-based
group-averaged R1, projected on the lateral inflated surface of one subject. (The left
hemisphere is mirror-reversed to align cortical maps for visual comparison). For tonotopic map
display, a patch of cortex including the entire temporal plane (shown in purple on the inflated
surface) was cut and flattened. Panels A-C show this region enlarged, with isocontour lines
showing quantitative R1 values for the group-averaged putative auditory core, and color maps
showing group-averaged best frequency as a function of (A) Tonotopy, (B) Attn-tono
(Stepped), and (C) Attn-tono (Randomized) conditions. The stars are fiduciary points to assist
in visual comparisons of maps across conditions; the outline of Heschl's gyrus is in yellow
dashed lines (in (A), from the individual subject whose cortical patch was used). Consistent
with previous work, the tonotopic map is characterized by two pairs of three interlacing bestfrequency ‘fingers,’ with the high-frequency fingers (red/orange colormap) showing greatest
frequency preference medially and extending laterally, where they meet interdigitated lowerfrequency fingers (green/yellow colormap) extending lateral to medial, with the longest ‘middle’
lower-frequency finger extending about halfway into auditory core. This pattern is evident in
Fourier-analysis-derived maps of the ‘stepped’ Attn-tono condition but not in the ‘randomized’
Attn-tono condition, for which the attentional response was phase-cancelled. All maps are

posterolaterally). Fig. 3 shows tonotopic maps for each individual listener. In general, the
relationship between auditory core and tonotopy group is conserved across listeners, albeit with
some variability in the shape and extent of the isointensity R1 contours.
We then asked whether ‘attention-tonotopic’ mapping resembled the tonotopic case in and
around auditory core. Here, the group-level spatial distribution of tonotopy is closely
recapitulated when spectrally-directed attention (‘stepped’ attn-tono condition) alone modulates

core, with a slight exception in the transition from higher to lower frequency preference in mid
core. In contrast, the group-level ‘randomized’ attn-tono response is much weaker, with almost
no correspondence with the tonotopic map (Fig. 2c), despite being acoustically identical to
‘stepped’ attention-o-tonotopy but for the shuffling of the verbal prompt ordering that destroyed
the consistent phase-lag associated with specific frequency bands supporting these Fourierbased analyses. The one potential exception is in and around posterolateral core, where there
is a low-to-mid frequency progression that is similar in attention-o-tonotopic and tonotopic maps,
particularly in the left hemisphere. (This may be due to the small (~1 octave) overall shift in
spectral mean over the course of a stimulus cycle noted in Methods).
Stimulus- and attentionally-driven tonotopic organization outside of auditory core. In line
with results from previous fMRI studies (Talavage et al., 2004; Woods et al., 2009; Humphries et
al., 2010; Barton et al., 2012; Dick et al., 2012; Moerel et al., 2012; Saenz and Langers, 2014;
Thomas et al., 2015; De Martino et al., 2015b; Ahveninen et al., 2016; Leaver and Rauschecker,
2016; Riecke et al., 2016), there is stimulus-driven tonotopic mapping extending well beyond
auditory core, spanning the temporal plane and continuing into the superior temporal sulcus
(STS). As shown in Fig. 2a, the overall arrangement is characterized by two pairs of three
interlacing best-frequency ‘fingers,’ with the high-frequency fingers (red/orange colormap)
predominating medially and extending laterally, where they meet interdigitated lower-frequency
fingers (green/yellow colormap) extending lateral to medial, with the longest ‘middle’ lowerfrequency finger extending about halfway into auditory core. Similar to tonotopy within auditory
core, the overall pattern of group activation can be observed in the majority of individual
subjects (Fig. 3), but there is also considerable individual variability in the complexity,
topography, and extent of tonotopic and attn-tono mapping, similar to that observed in the fMRI
studies cited above (as well as electrophysiological studies in a number of studies in macaque
and owl monkey, e.g., (Merzenich and Brugge, 1973; Morel et al., 1993)).
As can be seen in the maps in Fig. 2b, the tonotopically-aligned maps evoked by spectrallydirected attention are also present in the majority of auditory cortex outside of auditory core.
Again, the structure of the tonotopic map (as revealed by Fourier analysis) is abolished when
the attentional cue is randomized, thereby eliminating any consistent relationship between
attended frequency band and phase lag.
The similarity between the maps evoked by presentation of a single frequency band (tonotopy)
versus attention to one of two simultaneously-presented frequency bands (‘stepped’ attn-tono)
can also be seen in each individual subject (Fig. 3). As with the group-averaged data, there is a
close correspondence in the progression of preferred frequencies across auditory cortex in
individual subjects. The similarity between the tonotopic and attn-tono maps is particularly
striking in subjects 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. The tonotopic organization of individual subjects
demonstrated overall commonalities, but with notable differences, even between individual
subjects’ right and left hemispheres, particularly outside of auditory core (Humphries et al.,
2010; Moerel et al., 2014; Saenz and Langers, 2014). However, individual peculiarities were
replicated across tonotopic and attn-tono conditions. In some subjects, there was a surprising
lack of strong tonotopic mapping (subject 3 for which poor tonotopy may be due to greater EPI

stages. First, in each subject’s native EPI space, a voxel was coded as ‘1’ if tonotopic and attntono stimuli evoked the same best frequency, and otherwise coded as ‘0’. Second, for each
subject, the concordance maps were resampled to the individual’s cortical surface, and
projected onto the unit icosahedron for cross-subject surface-based averaging, thereby
creating a composite measure of agreement between tonotopic and attn-tono maps, weighted
by the consistency of this agreement across subjects. The concordance maps are statistically
masked with a cross-subject t-map, calculated versus chance agreement (p=0.20) with a
surface cluster correction of p < 0.001 (vertex-wise p<0.05, cluster threshold surface area>

The auditory cortical patches in Fig. 4a show the cross-subject average ‘Winner-TakesAll’ (WTA) best frequency band (most positive-going BOLD response relative to resting
baseline) maps for tonotopy and attn-tono conditions (with no shading for response amplitude).
These are overlaid with the outermost R1 isocontour (dashed yellow) corresponding to auditory
core. As should be expected, the topography of the WTA maps essentially recapitulates the
topography revealed by the phase-encoded analyses. The same holds true of the attn-tono WTA
maps from both the ‘stepped’ and importantly, the ‘randomized’ block conditions (Fig. 4a); this
result confirms that even without the 'crutch' of the stepping frequency band, listeners can direct
their attention to specific frequency bands.
The WTA approach also allowed us to straightforwardly quantify the within-subject
correspondence between voxel-wise best frequency, as estimated by tonotopy and by attn-tono.
Here, we coded each voxel in native space as a ‘1’ when best frequency was identical in both
conditions, and a ‘0’ otherwise. We then resampled each subject’s binary maps to their cortical
surface, and then averaged across subjects to create a ‘concordance’ map (Fig. 3b). These
maps (statistically thresholded at vertex-wise p< 0.01, with surface-cluster-corrected alpha of p
< 0.001) show that across subjects there was high concordance across best frequency maps
evoked by stimulus and by attention across much of the temporal plane in both hemispheres,
with little concordance in non-auditory areas.
Comparison of response profiles to all frequency bands across tonotopy and attn-tono.
As has been shown previously, e.g., Moerel et al., (2013), hemodynamic responses to
frequency in auditory cortex are not necessarily bandpass, but can more complex and
multipeaked. Therefore, we also examined whether attention to a given frequency band in the
presence of a distractor band recapitulates the more graded response to non-preferred
frequencies observed when that frequency band is presented in isolation. To do this, we created
and surface-morphed a set of small cortical ROIs to each subject (see Fig. 4c and Methods),
and quantified the similarity between the tonotopy and attn-tono response profiles in each ROI
in each hemisphere by regressing the mean tonotopic parameter estimate for each frequency
band against the attn-tono parameter estimate (with subjects as a random factor).
Converging with the results from the 'concordance' maps from the Winner-Takes-All analyses
(Fig. 4b), the ROI analyses (Fig. 4c) show that individual subjects' tonotopy and attn-tono
responses profiles are significantly associated across most of auditory cortex (all ROIs within
the white border), with the exception of the most lateral aspects of the STG and upper bank of
the STS. (Note that while there is a strong relationship between tonotopy and attn-tono
response profiles of each subject within a given ROI, there is cross-subject variability in the
particular shape of those response profiles, as suggested by the individual maps in Fig. 3).
There is a broad tendency for tonotopy/attn-tono profile similarity to be strongest posteriormedially in both hemispheres, and no clear indication that profile similarity is higher in auditory
core (indeed, this is not the case in the left hemisphere).

associated with the minimum BOLD response across frequency, and that this topography would
also be recapitulated by attention. Thus, we also performed a parallel ‘Loser-Takes-All’ (LTA)
analysis, in which we coded voxels by the frequency band driving the minimum BOLD response
(again relative to resting baseline) and analyzed as above. The average descriptive LTA maps
show roughly opposite frequency responses compared to the WTA tonotopic maps, with higherfrequency-band-preferring regions in the tonotopic map being least driven by lower-frequencybands, and vice versa (Fig. 5a). (There is also some overlap in the ‘mid-frequency-preferring’
regions, likely due to blurring of values when averaging subjects’ integer-based maps). There is
also quite close correspondence between the frequency band evoking the least response in the
tonotopy (stimulus) condition and the smallest BOLD response evoked by attending to a given
frequency band. The LTA concordance maps show that in the right hemisphere, the alignment of
tonotopic and attn-tono maps is greatest in more lateral and anterior auditory cortex, with
qualitatively somewhat greater concordance more medially in the left hemisphere (Fig. 5b,
statistical thresholding as in Fig. 4b).

selective attention across subjects. We first used a subject’s native-space WTA map to establish
each voxel’s best frequency. Then, we assigned each voxel the parameter estimate for the
difference in activation between attending to its best frequency in the presence of a distractor,
versus attending to the distractor and ignoring its best frequency. (In other words, the value at
each voxel was the estimated difference in activation between attending to, versus ignoring, its
best frequency in the presence of other frequency bands). We then resampled each subject’s
native-space ‘attention map’ to her/his cortical surface to allow for surface-based cross-subject
averaging and statistical testing (again with a vertex-wise p< 0.01 threshold and surfacecluster-corrected alpha of p < 0.001). Fig. 6 shows that across subjects there was significantly
greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency was attended versus
ignored. The widespread attention effect included all of R1-estimated auditory core (outlined in
green), extending from the inferior circular sulcus laterally to the upper bank of the STS, and
antero-posteriorly from the temporal pole onto the planum temporale.

where tonotopic amplitude and R1 drop in tandem over a narrow band of cortex. There is also
negative local spatial covariance between tonotopic amplitude and R1 within the center of
auditory cortex, where tonotopic amplitude increases but R1 remains relatively stable. (There is

also some tonotopic/R1 spatial covariance within and around the central sulcus; these regions
showed considerably less overall amplitude in tonotopic response, but one that spatially
covaries with changes in R1).
To test the replicability of this novel tonotopy-versus-R1 searchlight cross-correlation, we
reanalyzed R1 and tonotopy data from a previous study (Dick et al., 2012) that used a different
tonotopic stimulus (bandpass-filter-swept non-linguistic vocalizations) and a slightly different
multiparameter mapping protocol. Despite these methodological differences, we found a very
similar pattern of tonotopic/R1 positive local spatial covariance within the circular sulcus and
along the lateral STG, with negative spatial covariance again in the center of auditory cortex
(Fig. 7b). The shared and relatively steep anterolateral and medial gradients in putative
myelination and degree of frequency specificity - observed in two independently-acquired
datasets - suggests a shared functional and myeloarchitectonic border, possibly similar in
character to those reported recently relating resting state, standard task activation, and T1/T2derived myelination estimates across cortex (Glasser et al., 2016; Kuehn et al., 2017).
As seen in Fig. 7c, the spatial relationship between local R1 and attn-tono amplitude changes is
much less clear. Here, there is a weak relationship within and around auditory cortex that is only
observed within the circular sulcus (particularly in the right hemisphere). There are also stripes
of spatial covariation along the banks of the central sulcus, although not closely aligned with the
pattern observed with the tonotopy versus R1 covariance maps. Although very preliminary, these
results suggest that changes in the degree of spectral attentional modulation in auditory cortex
are not strongly linked to the underlying myeloarchitecture, and stands in contrast to the
consistent spatial association in lateral and medial auditory cortex between local changes in R1
and the strength of stimulus-driven frequency response preference.
Summary. Everyday listening ordinarily takes place in rich soundscapes within multiple,
simultaneous sound sources contributing to the overlapping mix of sound waves that arrives at
the ears. Auditory attention is crucial to sorting out the mix. Listeners direct attentional focus to a
sound source, or even to specific acoustic dimensions within a single sound source, to zero in
on auditory information that is diagnostic in guiding behavior.
We asked how endogenous attention directed to specific acoustic frequency bands modulates
human auditory cortical activity. Using high-resolution quantitative MRI and a novel fMRI
paradigm for driving sustained selective attention within specific frequency bands, we
established effects of spectrally-specific attention in myeloarchitectonically-estimated human
auditory core. These effects extend across the majority of tonotopically-mapped auditory cortex,
and are apparent in individual listeners. Sensory-driven best-frequency tonotopic maps align
with attentionally-driven maps across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in
non-auditory areas. Individual tonotopic and attention-o-tonontopic maps show correlated
idiosyncracies. The frequency bands that evoke the least BOLD response from input and from
attention also exhibit close spatial correspondence. There is greater activation across most of
auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored. Finally, there is local spatial
correspondence in multiple auditory regions between the degree of R1-estimated myelination,
and the strength of the frequency-band-selective fMRI response for tonotopic stimuli.

Discussion
Human auditory core exhibits attentionally-driven tonotopic organization. Previous
findings showed similar stimulus- and attentionally-driven frequency preference in and around
Heschl’s gyrus, a macroanatomical landmark associated with primary auditory areas (Da Costa
et al., 2013; Riecke et al., 2016) Here, we demonstrate that, within quantitative-R1-defined
primary auditory areas, the attentionally-driven tonotopy in each hemisphere is very similar to
the detailed tonotopic maps in the same subjects. As shown by comparison maps across the
acoustically-identical stepped and randomized attention-o-tonotopy conditions (Figs. 2 and 4),
the alignment between tonotopic and attention maps depends on allocation of attention to the
cued frequency band, not perceptual interference or other stimulus-driven effects. The fact that
there is considerable, high-level attentional modulation within primary auditory areas is
interesting given previous results suggesting more limited attentional topographic modulation in
primary auditory (Atiani et al., 2014) and visual (Saygin and Sereno, 2008) cortex, compared to
more robust attentional modulation in areas immediately adjacent to primary ones.
Attentionally-driven tonotopic organization extends across much of auditory cortex. We
also find strong evidence for tonotopically-mapped spectrally-directed attention in much of
auditory cortex, particularly along the lateral superior temporal gyrus (potentially analogous to
lateral auditory belt and parabelt regions in macaque (Hackett, 2007)). In addition to the
concordance in and around auditory core (as defined by quantitative MR), the most consistent
group-level alignment of these maps lies lateral to auditory core, with each map characterized
by three higher-to-lower best-frequency-band traversals, moving from posterior to anterior
roughly along the superior temporal gyrus.
This pattern suggests a cross-species parallel to results reported in ferret (Atiani et al., 2014),
where task-evoked attentional modulation of frequency-tuned neurons is particularly strong in
non-primary (dPEG) tonotopically mapped auditory areas in ferret. In this regard, the stimulus
complexity, variability, and memory demands of the current task to a may have helped to drive
attentional response in these more lateral and anterior areas. Our results are consistent with a
human fMRI comparison of cross-modal attentional effects (Petkov et al., 2004), which showed
greater activation in lateral auditory regions when attention was directed to a demanding
auditory repetition detection task than when the same sounds were played as subjects
performed a demanding visual detection task. However, they differ from these studies to some
degree in that attentionally-driven tonotopic modulation in auditory core was also robust (similar
to cross-modal attention studies in macaque A1 (O'Connell et al., 2014) and primary auditory
areas (De Martino et al., 2015a)), and did not differ significantly from that in lateral belt.
There was good correspondence between the voxel-wise best frequency-band for tonotopy and
attention-tonotopy in individual listeners. Like several prior studies (data and review in
(Humphries et al., 2010; Moerel et al., 2014; Saenz and Langers, 2014; Brewer and Barton,
2016; Leaver and Rauschecker, 2016)), we observed quite substantial variation in the detailed
topography of tonotopy across individuals (but cf. Ahveninen et al., (2016)). It is especially

noteworthy that attention-tonotopy recapitulated these topographic idiosyncrasies (as observed
in the concordance analyses, Fig. 4b and 5b).
It is intriguing that there was a systematic frequency-band-associated topography not only of
best frequency but also of dis-preferred frequency and, also, that the frequency-selective
attenuation of BOLD gain relative to other frequencies can be recapitulated by selective
attention to that frequency band in the presence of other spectral information. One could
speculate that this map structure might be a population-level reflection of an ‘inhibitory surround’
structure observed in some electrophysiology studies (Calford and Semple, 1995; Sutter et al.,
1999) but cf Wehr and Zador, (2003), with the frequency band driving the least BOLD response
corresponding to the deepest trough in an asymmetric surround -- an effect that could drive the
very similar tonotopic and attn-tono graded frequency response preferences revealed in the
multiple ROI analysis (Fig. 4c).
Here, the average frequency response profile evoked by the single-band tonotopic stimuli was
recapitulated by attention to the same frequency bands in the context of distractors. Prior
human neuroimaging research has been consistent with the possibility that the shape of the
frequency response in and around Heschl’s gyrus is attentionally-modulated in a bandpass
manner that relies on amplification rather than attenuation (Riecke et al., 2016). Based on
results from a larger number of spectral bands, the current findings suggest that, at least at a
more macroscopic scale, spectrally-directed attention modulates cortical activity in a more
graded fashion, with the shape of the attentional response to both preferred and less-preferred
frequency bands similar to that evoked by stimulus alone - a contention supported by the
alignment of the ‘Loser-Takes-All’ tonotopic and attn-tono maps. That is, the frequency band that
drives the smallest fMRI response when presented alone is also the frequency band that elicits
the least activation when attended in the presence of a distractor. A better understanding of the
mechanisms underlying these maps will require more fine-grained characterization of
frequency-directed attentional modulation, preferably at very high spectral and temporal
resolution (Moerel et al., 2013; Lutti et al., 2014; Moerel et al., 2014; Ahveninen et al., 2016) that
might also help to unveil cortical-depth-specific attentional effects (De Martino et al., 2015a). In
particular, it will be important to see whether different fMRI tasks - using more complex
naturalistic sounds, or more or less abstract cues to frequency - can mimic the task-, valenceand context-dependent effects observed in non-human animal cortical auditory receptive fields,
where the character of the ‘contrast-enhancing’ modulations differs markedly with experimental
manipulation

Kuchibhotla et al., 2017). (It is worth noting that task-related modulation of frequency-selective
attentional effects has long been of interest in human auditory psychophysics (Greenberg, 1968;
Scharf et al., 1987; Scharf, 1989; Moore et al., 1996; Green and McKeown, 2001)).
There is correspondence between local change in R1-estimated myelination and the
strength of fMRI-assessed relative frequency selectivity. We found that the change in the
degree to which a small (4 mm radius) patch of cortex shows strong frequency preferences in
tonotopy was positively spatially correlated with its degree of myelination as estimated by R1.
The strength of the correlation was anatomically specific, marking the medial border of auditory
cortex (within the circular sulcus) and revealing a potential anatomical index of ‘processing style’

(from more to less tonotopically mapped) along anterolateral superior temporal gyrus. We found
this pattern to hold true in the data from the current study as well as in an independent cohort
scanned with quite different tonotopic stimuli and with multiparameter maps acquired on a
different scanner (Fig. 7c). Although there was a relatively reliable pattern of R1-tonotopy
correspondence at a group level, there was some notable individual variation in local shared R1/
tonotopy gradients relative to gyral anatomy. Thus, these patterns may be more useful than
curvature for establishing areal borders on an individual subject basis, particularly when there is
no obvious sharp change in a single measure (for discussion see also (Glasser et al., 2016)).
Such work holds promise for generating novel hypotheses for more intensively characterized
species like mouse, ferret, or marmoset, particularly in tandem with imaging techniques that that
can cover multiple cortical areas simultaneously.
Future Directions. In the current study, we limited our investigation to broadly defined auditory
cortex, where there was good evidence for systematic tonotopic representation from a number
of previous studies (Talavage and Edmister, 2004; Hackett, 2007; Moerel et al., 2013; 2014;
Saenz and Langers, 2014; Leaver and Rauschecker, 2016). In future research it will be
informative to examine interactions with several frontal regions whose potential analogues are
known to have direct feedforward and feedback connections in macaque monkeys (Romanski
and Goldman-Rakic, 2002), and where in ferret there are clear modulatory influences on
primary and non-primary auditory cortex during learning (Atiani et al., 2014; Shamma and Fritz,
2014). Similar to recent work in vision (Klein et al., 2014; Puckett and DeYoe, 2015), it will also
be useful to establish the shape of the attentional population receptive field, and how this varies
across auditory areas and relates to stimulus-driven auditory population receptive field size
(Thomas et al., 2015). Finally, following on our own pilot work, it will be exciting to explore
whether higher-level auditory regionalization may follow along some of the 'fault lines' revealed
by shared local tonotopic and myelin gradients, and whether or not more sophisticated and finegrained spectral attentional manipulations may reveal a relationship between the degree of
attentional malleability and underlying cortical architecture and circuitry.

Abstract

The stochastic simulation algorithm commonly known as Gillespie’s algorithm (orig-

inally derived for modelling well-mixed systems of chemical reactions) is now used ubiquitously
in the modelling of biological processes in which stochastic effects play an important role. In well
mixed scenarios at the sub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between successive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be appropriately modelled as
a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie algorithm. However, Gillespie’s algorithm
is routinely applied to model biological systems for which it was never intended. In particular,
processes in which cell proliferation is important (e.g. embryonic development, cancer formation)
should not be simulated naively using the Gillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature

of the cell cycle breaks the Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle
times is far less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same mean.
Here we suggest a method of modelling the cell cycle that restores the memoryless property
to the system and is therefore consistent with simulation via the Gillespie algorithm. By breaking
the cell cycle into a number of independent exponentially distributed stages we can restore the
Markov property at the same time as more accurately approximating the appropriate cell cycle time
distributions. The consequences of our revised mathematical model are explored analytically as far
as possible. We demonstrate the importance of employing the correct cell cycle time distribution by
recapitulating the results from two models incorporating cellular proliferation (one spatial and one
non-spatial) and demonstrating that changing the cell cycle time distribution makes quantitative
and qualitative differences to the outcome of the models. Our adaptation will allow modellers
and experimentalists alike to appropriately represent cellular proliferation - vital to the accurate
modelling of many biological processes - whilst still being able to take advantage of the power and
efficiency of the popular Gillespie algorithm.

1 Introduction

In a well-mixed solution of chemicals undergoing reactions, non-reactive collisions occur far more
often than reactive collisions allowing us to neglect the fast dynamics of motion. We can thus assume
that the time between reactive collision events is exponentially distributed with rates which are a
combinatorial function of the numbers of available reactants (Gillespie, 1976, 1977). This premise
is the basis of the Gillespie (1976) stochastic simulation algorithm1 . The Gillespie algorithm has
become a ubiquitous algorithm for the simulation of stochastic systems in the biological sciences,
in particular in computational systems biology (Szekely and Burrage, 2014).
However, the Gillespie algorithm is often used inappropriately to represent processes for which
the inter-event time is not exponentially distributed. One prevalent example of this is in the
simulation of the cell cycle (Baar et al., 2016; Castellanos-Moreno et al., 2014; Figueredo et al.,
1
Although Gillespie was the first to popularise the stochastic simulation algorithm and derived its from
physical considerations, its conception dates back to the work of Doob (1945) and Feller (1940).

figure 1). The assumption of memorylessness, and consequently exponentially-distributed cell cycle
times, means that with high probability a daughter cell may divide immediately after the division
event which created it. This is not biologically plausible since each cell is required to pass through
the G1 , S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle before division, and these phases (in particular
S-phase) are rate-limiting.

The rate parameter of the exponential distribution was fitted by minimising the sum of squared residuals
between the curve and the bars of the histogram.

As an illustrative example, Turner et al. (2009) present a well-mixed stochastic model of small
populations of cancer stem cells, which they use to suggest treatment strategies. Both analytical
and simulated results pertaining to the survival of the tumour are based on the assumption that
inter-division times are exponentially distributed. We demonstrate later in this paper that using the
correct cell cycle time distributions (CCTDs) could alter their results leading to different suggested
treatment strategies.
Non-Markovian simulation methods exist for events which do not have exponentially distributed
inter-event times (Boguná et al., 2014). However, these algorithms are often difficult to understand
and complex to encode since we are required to keep track of every cell individually. This presents
a potential barrier to their use and consequently a barrier to the appropriate modelling of CCTDs.

Given the ubiquity of the Gillespie algorithm, it would be significantly more beneficial if we could
decompose the cell cycle into a series of exponentially distributed events which could be naturally
encoded in the framework of the Gillespie algorithm. One potential solution to this problem is the
use of phase-type distributions. These are an extremely general class of distributions constructed
by convolving or “mixing” exponential distributions. Generically, the phase-type distributions are
a result of multiple Poisson processes occurring in “phases” or stages. The sequence in which these
phases occur can itself be a stochastic process. Phase-type distributions can be used to represent
the duration of any specified biochemical process since they are dense in the field of all positivevalued distributions (Rolski et al., 1999). This means that they can be used to approximate any
positive-valued distribution, of which waiting times are a specific example. In particular, we can
model the length of the cell cycle using a general phase-type distribution.
Whilst this is potentially good news, allowing us to simulate generic waiting time distributions
using the familiar Gillespie algorithm, one of the main drawbacks with using phase-type distributions is parameter identifiability. Their generic nature means, in general, that there are many
ways to fit parameters to a given experimental data set. Fortunately, there are special cases of
phase-type distributions which may allow greater parameter identifiability whilst still accurately
representing CCTDs. One particular subclass which has been suggested to accurately represent
phases of the cell cycle (and, by closedness of the sums of these distributions, the cell cycle itself)
are the hypoexponential family of distributions (Stewart, 2009). These distributions are made up of
a series of k independent exponential distributions, each with its own rate, λi , in series. Generally,
these distributions have significantly fewer parameters than the general phase-type distribution
and are therefore more appropriate as models of the cell cycle. However, if k is large then we will
still face issues with parameter identifiability in these models.
Recently, Weber et al. (2014) have suggested that a delayed hypoexponential distribution (consisting of three delayed exponential distributions in series) could be used to appropriately represent
the cell cycle. These delayed exponential distributions represents the G1 , S and a combined G2 {M
phases of the cell cycle. Their model is an extension of the seminal stochastic cell cycle model of

A multi-stage representation of cell proliferation as a Markov process

Smith and Martin (1973) who use a single delayed exponential distribution to capture the variance in the cell cycle. Delayed hypoexponential distributions representing periods of the cell cycle
have been justified by appealing to the work of Bel et al. (2009). Bel et al. (2009) showed that
the completion time for a large class of complex theoretical biochemical systems, including DNA
synthesis and repair, protein translation and molecular transport, can be well approximated by
either deterministic or exponential distributions.
In both of the cell cycle models mentioned above (Smith and Martin, 1973; Weber et al., 2014),
the delay period captures a fixed deterministic time period before which the cell can not move on
to the next stage, whilst the exponentially distributed waiting time allows for the representation
of variation in the phase times. While the model of Smith and Martin (1973) has been dismissed
as being overly simplistic, the revised model of Weber et al. (2014) comprises six parameters and
therefore suffers from parameter identifiability issues. Despite this Weber et al. (2014) were able to
analyse the steady state proportions of cells in each phase and to suggest novel ways of determining
phase and cell cycle time distributions experimentally.
In this paper we consider two special cases of the general hypoexponential distribution: the
Erlang and exponentially modified Erlang distribution which, in turn, are special cases of the
Gamma and exponentially-modified Gamma distributions. For reference their PDFs PE and PEME ,
respectively, are given below:

With suitable parameter choices, both PDFs can achieve the the peaked distributions typical of
many CCTDs (Golubev, 2016) (see Fig 2). As special cases of the hypoexponential distributions,
these distributions also have the significant advantage that they can be simulated using the ubiquitous Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm. This will allow for the appropriate representation
of CCTDs in stochastic models of cell populations, in contrast to the inappropriate exponentially
distributed times which are commonly used (Baar et al., 2016; Castellanos-Moreno et al., 2014;
Figueredo et al., 2014; Mort et al., 2016; Ryser et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2009; Zaider and Minerbo,

Figure 2 demonstrates the improved agreement between the Erlang and exponentially modified
Erlang distributions with the experimental data in comparison to the exponential distribution (c.f.
figure 1). In each case the parameters of the distributions are fitted by minimising the sum of
squared residuals, Σ, between the curve and the bars of the histogram2 . Clearly, for the exponential distribution (see figure 1), the shape of the curve is incorrect. Consequently the exponential distribution gives a poor representation of the true CCTD with a sum of squared residuals

 0.0251, λ2  0.0019 and k  26 gives an even better agreement to the data3

Note that even simpler methods of fitting are possible. In particular, given the first two (three) moments
for the Erlang (exponentially modified Erlang) distribution, parameters can be identified by matching
moments. This implies the knowledge of the whole distribution of cell cycle times is not necessary. For the
Erlang distribution one would need only the mean and variance of cell cycle times. For the exponentially
modified Erlang distribution the skewness would also be required.

The three-parameter exponentially modified Erlang distribution may be poorly constrained for some
data sets. That is to say there are several values of the parameters which give almost equally good fits to
the data. Keeping the aim of carrying out stochastic simulation using the determined distribution in mind,

 6.01  108 . The exponentially modified Erlang

distribution achieves a minimised sum of squared residuals which is around half that of the Erlang
distribution. This is not surprising however, since the exponentially modified Erlang distribution
has an additional parameter. It is debatable whether the benefit in fit gained by the extra parameter outweighs the increased difficulty in correctly identifying the extra parameter from a limited
data set. It seems clear that the additional parameter added between the exponential distribution
and the Erlang distribution has a far more significant effect than the additional parameter between
the Erlang and exponentially modified Erlang distributions. Never-the-less, both Erlang and exponentially modified Erlang are good candidates for fitting cell cycle time data and can both be
simulated within the existing Gillespie framework, so will be considered here.

In Section 2 we begin by outlining a general hypoexponential model of the cell cycle and noting
that many previous models of the cell cycle are special cases. By simplifying the model further
we demonstrate that the Erlang and exponentially modified Erlang distributions are also special
cases. In Section 3, we consider the special case of the Erlang distributed CCTD in more detail.
Undertaking some simple analysis we derive the expected behaviour of the mean cell number
in the case of Erlang CCTDs and demonstrate analytically that significant differences can arise
in comparison to models in which exponentially distributed CCTDs are used. In Section 4 we
demonstrate the utility of our new CCTD representation in stochastic simulations of two biological
models in which cellular proliferation is of critical importance. In each case we show, through
simulation, that there are important quantitative and qualitative differences between models which
represent cell cycle times appropriately and those which do not. We conclude in Section 5 with a
short discussion on the implications of our findings.

we suggest a preference for acceptable parameter values with the smallest possible value of k. The larger
the value of k the more “reaction channels” the Gillespie algorithm must account for which, if rate-limiting,
will significantly reduce the algorithm’s performance.

2 Multi-stage model of the cell cycle

We divide the cell cycle (with mean length C) into k stages4 . The time to progress through each of
these stages is exponentially distributed with mean µi . We can represent the progression through
these stages of the cell cycle as the following chain of ‘reactions’

The CCT under this model is hypoexponentially distributed. Although there is no simple
closed form for the probability density function of the hypoexponential distribution we can find
simple expressions for its mean and variance. The mean is given by the sum of the means of the
exponentially distributed stage times
these stage times,

°k
i1 µi  C and the variance is the sum of the variances of

°k 2
i1 µi . By increasing the number of exponentially distributed stages, whilst

decreasing their mean duration (in order to maintain the correct mean CCT), we can arbitrarily
decrease the variance of the CCT. Many multi-stage models of the cell cycle are special cases of
this general model (Golubev, 2016; Hawkins et al., 2007; Hillen et al., 2010; Hoel and Crump,
1974; Kendall, 1948; Leander et al., 2014; León et al., 2004; Nakaoka and Inaba, 2014; Powell,
1955; Smith and Martin, 1973; Weber et al., 2014; Zilman et al., 2010).
We can analyse the cell cycle reaction chain (2) further by considering the associated probability
master equation (PME). Let P px1 , x2 , . . . , xk , tq be shorthand for the probability that there are x1
cells in stage one, x2 in stage two and so on. The PME is

Note, these stages do not necessarily correspond to the traditional (G1 , S, G2 and M ) phases of the
cell cycle. Indeed, there is good evidence that at least one of the phases is not exponentially distributed
(Hahn et al., 2009). Rather they are arbitrary division of the cell cycle which will allow us to recreate the
correct CCTD.

3 Identical rates of progression

The hypoexponential model’s generality is also a significant drawback since it hampers parameter
identifiability (Weber et al., 2014). As such, we seek to reduce the number of free parameters in the
model whilst maintaining its ability to accurately represent CCTDs. Several authors have suggested
using the Gamma distribution to model CCTDs (Hawkins et al., 2007; Kendall, 1948; Nakaoka
and Inaba, 2014; Zilman et al., 2010). If we assume that all transition rates, λi , are identically
equal to λ1 (for i

 1, . . . , k) in our general hypoexponential model, then the time to progress

through the whole cell cycle is distributed according to the sum of k identically exponentially
distributed random variables. It is straightforward to show (using moment generating functions
or convolutions) that the CCTD, is Erlang distributed with scale parameter µ

 C {k and shape

parameter k. In analogy with the general hypoexponential case, if we decrease µ and simultaneously
increase k so that µk

 C remains constant, the Erlang distribution approaches the Dirac delta

function centred on C, demonstrating that we can still arbitrarily reduce the variance to match
the distribution we are trying to model.

3.1 Analysis of the CCDT with equal rates of progression

We now analyse this CCTD model with identical rates of progression, noting that Kendall (1948)
studied this case extensively and we draw on some of his analyses below. Although for this special
case it is possible to derive a closed form first order partial differential equation for the evolution

of the generating function corresponding the the master equation (3), solving the associated characteristic equations is analytically intractable for all but the simplest case (k

 1) (Kendall, 1948).

Instead we will focus on the mean behaviour of the cell population with which we can make some
analytical progress.

In the multi-stage model, under the assumption that all cells are evenly distributed between the

However, the assumption on the even distributions of cells between stages is incorrect. This
leads to differences not just, as might be expected, between the variation exhibited by the multistage and single-stage models, but also between their mean behaviour. In figure 3 (a) a clear
difference between the k

3.2 Cells are not distributed proportional to stage length

Returning to equations (4) under the assumption of identical rates of progression through the
stages, we can derive corresponding equations for the mean proportion of cells in each stage,

That is to say there are twice as many cells in the first stage as the last stage at steady state when
the number of stages is large.

These differences are potentially important for determining average CCTs experimentally. One
popular in vitro method for determining cell cycle times is to label S-phase cells using two sequentially administered distinct DNA specific labels (Bokhari and Raza, 1992; Wimber and Quastler,
1963). The administration of the labels is separated by a known time period. By counting cells
labelled with one or both labels, and with reference to the known time period of separation, it is
possible to calculate the mean duration of the S-phase. Once the proportion of cells in S-phase
and the mean duration of S-phase have been determined it is also possible to calculate the mean
cell cycle time for the population (Nowakowski et al., 1989).

The method outlined above implicitly makes the assumption that the number of cells in a
particular phase of the cell cycle is proportional to the length of that phase. For the multi-stage
model we have demonstrated that in the large time limit this is unequivocally not the case. Equation
(11) can also be used to show that this phenomenon holds dynamically, although the mathematics
is cumbersome. Instead we solve equations (4) numerically. Numerical solution also allows us to
investigate the more general hypoexponential CCTD model (2) for which no analytical solutions
are available. Figures 4 (a) and (b) display the evolution of the mean numbers and proportions
(respectively) of cells in each stage for equal stage progression rates, λ1 , and figures 4 (c) and
(d) display the equivalent for unequal progression rates. The number/proportion of cells in each
stage is not proportional to the mean duration of the stage, µi , either at steady state (compare
actual steady state proportions with the stars representing the normalised mean stage durations,
µi {

°

µi , in 4 (b) and 4 (d)) or dynamically.

3.3 The exponentially modified Erlang distribution
Although the identical-stage model, which gives rise to the Erlang distribution for CCTDs, is
convenient from a mathematical perspective, it has been shown to have been outperformed by a
number of other distributions (Golubev, 2010, 2016). In particular, by considering 77 independent
CCT data sets, Golubev (2016) has recently shown that one of the most appropriate distributions
for representing CCTDs is the exponentially modified Gamma (EMG) distribution. For our purposes we will require that the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution is be integer valued so
that the CCTD is actually an exponentially modified Erlang (EME). This will mean that we can

continue to simulate CCTs using a series of exponentially distributed random variables (albeit one
of them will have a different rate). Consequently this will allow us to continue to appropriately
simulate processes in which cell division is important using the popular Gillespie algorithm. In
order to generate EME distributed CCTs we modify our multi-stage cell cycle model as follows:

Note that, in system (29), the rate of progression is identical through each of the initial k stages of
cell cycle and that we have added an additional exponentially distributed stage at the end whose
rate, λ2 , is distinct from the rate, λ1 , of the previous k stages.
We can ascertain the probability density function for the EME distribution, PEME ptq, by convolving the Erlang (PER ptq) and exponential (PE ptq) distributions as follows,

where λ2 is the rate of the exponential distribution with which we are convolving and, as before,
λ1 is the rate of progression through each of the k identical exponentially distributed stages which
comprise the Erlang distribution. We can simplify expression (30) to the following formulation

We note that it is almost as simple to simulate this more general distribution in the Gillespie
algorithm using a series of exponentially distributed stages as it is to simulate the distribution
with constant rates of progression between stages. Indeed the simulation of any hypoexponential
CCTD is straightforward in the Gillespie algorithm. However, the addition of extra parameters
hampers their identifiability when fitting to experimental data and as such we only suggest using
the Erlang or exponentially modified Erlang distributions in models of the CCTD.

In the following section we illustrate the importance of incorporating non-exponentially distributed CCTDs into stochastic simulations of cellular proliferation. For ease of understanding we
concentrate purely on Erlang CCTDs, and note that the parameters are not based on fitted CCTDs
but merely chosen for illustrative purposes.

4 Illustrative examples

In this section we recapitulate results from two different models which each assume exponentially
distributed CCTs. The first is a well mixed model of cancer stem cell proliferation and differentiation
in a brain tumour. The second a spatially extended model of cell migration and proliferation
mimicking a growth-to-confluence experimental assay. In each case we alter the CCTD in order to
see what effect this has on the qualitative and quantitative results presented in the papers. For
clarity we will restrict ourselves to Erlang distributed CCTs, but note that results are qualitatively
similar for exponentially modified Erlang distributed CCTs.

4.1 Cancer stem cell maintenance

Turner et al. (2009) investigate the role of sub-populations of cells within a brain tumour possessing stem cell-like properties and responsible for maintaining the tumour. In situations (e.g.
post treatment) in which there are small numbers of stem cells they consider a stochastic model
of cell proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells, S, can undergo symmetric division in which
the daughter cells possess the same characteristics as the parent cells (see equation (32)) and the
stem cell population increases. They can also undergo asymmetric self renewal in which one stem
cell and one progenitor cell, P , are produced (see equation (33)) or symmetric proliferation in
which two progenitor cells result from a stem cell division (see equation (34)). Cell cycle times are
exponentially distributed with rate ρs and fate choices (about which division type to undergo) are
made at the point of division. With probability r1 symmetric division occurs and with probability
r3 symmetric proliferation occurs. Consequently with probability r2

 1  r1  r3

asymmetric

self renewal occurs. These divisions with their effective rates are captured in the reaction system

Under the assumption of exponential CCTDs, Turner et al. (2009) write down and solve a
simple probability master equation for the stem cell population. In particular, they consider the
case in which r1

this assumption the mean number of cells in the stem cell population and variance can be shown to
increase exponentially. Since the model is linear, by appealing to the central limit theorem, Turner
et al. (2009) argue that, for large enough cell populations, the exact mean field equations given by
dS
dt

 ρspr1  r3 qS

(35)

will approximate the stochastic dynamics well.
In order to ensure a more realistic representation of the CCTD we introduce a multi-stage cell
division process, as suggested above, so that the CCTDs are now Erlang distributed with the same
mean ρs , but with shape parameter k (and thus scale parameter µ1

 1{pρskq). As, before, at each

division event, a choice about the type of division to occur is made with the same probabilities
(r1 , r2 , r3 ) as previously specified. Although we still get exponential increases in the mean and
variance, the rate of increase is significantly decreased (see Figs. 5 (a) and (b)). Crucially this
means that the deterministic mean-field model derived from the original process will significantly
overestimate the number of cancer stem cells in the tumour which could have significant therapeutic
implications.
Under this model with r1

¡ r3 , if a tumour is not completely eradicated by treatment it is

possible that it can return. It may, therefore be informative to know the probability that a tumour
will reach a certain size by a particular time in order to plan appropriate follow-up therapeutic

intervention. For example we may be interested to know the evolution of the probability that the
tumour has reached 1000 stem cells in size (which we will denote p1000 ptq) so that we might calculate
the most appropriate time to initiate the follow-up intervention. In figure 5 (c) we plot the evolution
of p1000 ptq over time. It is clear, by t

 100, that the probability of the tumour having grown to

1000 stem cells, p1000 varies significantly depending on the value of k used in the model despite
the cells having the same mean CCT. The effects of varying CCTD can clearly be seen to influence
the model outcome even in this relatively straightforward linear model of cellular proliferation. In
more complex models, in which other species depend in a non-linear manner on the number of
cells, the effects will no doubt be further exacerbated. The potential for therapeutic interventions
to be based on stochastic mathematical models of cellular proliferation further emphasises the
importance of modelling the CCTD correctly.

4.2 Growth to confluence assays

Baker and Simpson (2010) investigate the role of spatial correlations on individual-based models of
cell migration, proliferation and death, designed to represent experimental assays of cell behaviour
in culture. The individual-based models they employ are on-lattice, volume-exclusion processes in
two and three dimensions in which cell migration, proliferation and death events are all considered
to be exponentially distributed. Cell proliferation occurs when a cell is chosen to divide, placing a
daughter cell at one of its neighbouring lattice sites. Baker and Simpson (2010) demonstrate the

effects of spatial correlations in these models. In particular, they find that changing the motility
of the cells can alter their net rate of growth in comparison to the logistic growth predicted by a
simple mean field assumption which neglects the effects of correlations. This effect is due to the
fact that cell motility serves to break up correlations allowing more proliferation events to occur
in comparison to the lower motility case. By explicitly considering the correlations between the
occupancies of pairs of lattice sites, Baker and Simpson (2010) derive a more accurate populationlevel model which better represents the growth in the number of cells over time for a diverse range
of parameter values.
Here we are interested in investigating the effect of incorporating a more realistic model of cell
proliferation on the behaviour of the individual-level model, rather than trying to derive accurate
population-level models. As such, we alter the mechanism of cellular proliferation from the original,
exponentially distributed division times to our more realistic multi-stage Erlang distributed division
times and observe the effect this has on the growth of the cell population. In order to achieve this we
break the proliferation process into k stages, the passage through each of which has an exponentially
distributed waiting time (as described above). As before, we chose the parameter of each stages’
waiting time to ensure we have the same mean proliferation attempt time as in the original model.
In more detail, we consider a volume-exclusion process on a regular, square lattice in two
dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. Each lattice site, of length h, can hold at most one
cell. Each repeat realisation begins by initialising, particles uniformly at random across the Lx  Ly
sites of the lattice. Agents can move between adjacent (in the von Neumann sense) lattice sites
with rate Pm . Movement is unbiased, meaning that once a cell has been chosen to move it does
so into one of its four neighbouring lattice sites with equal probability. If the site into which a cell
attempts to move is already occupied then that movement event is aborted: the cell attempting
movement remains at its current site.
Agents undergo a proliferation stage change with rate Pp k (giving average rate Pp for unhindered progression through the k stages required for division) this results in the cell’s current
proliferation stage being incremented by one if the cell is currently in one of the first k  1 stages.

Christian A. Yates et al.

If the cell is in the final stage (stage k) of proliferation and is selected to change stage then the cell
attempts to place a daughter in one of its four neighbouring lattice sites with equal probability. If
the chosen site is empty the division event is successful, the cell places a daughter in the empty
site and the proliferation stages of both the parent and the daughter are reset to unity. However,
if the cell attempts to place a daughter in a site which is already occupied then that proliferation
event is aborted. In the multi-stage model of the cell cycle, we then have two choices:
(1) the progression stage of the cell attempting proliferation is reset to unit, meaning it must
progress through k stages of the cell cycle before again attempting to divide;
(2) the cell remains in the k th stage, immediately ready for another division event should it be
selected.
In the original model in which k

 1 these two choices are identical. Under implementation (1)

cells would have the same average rate of division attempts as in the original model. However,
it could be argued that implementation (2) is more realistic as real cells do not reverse through
the cell cycle if division is not favourable, but remain held at checkpoints until division becomes
possible (Alberts et al., 2002). We will investigate both possibilities. In order to clearly distinguish
the effects of the different CCTDs we will not consider cell death in our simulations. For different
values of Pp the population will naturally grow at different rates. As in (Baker and Simpson, 2010)
we will rescale time t̄  Pp t in order to make populations comparable.

cases.
In the multi-stage model, implementation (1) generally leads to less dense colonies than implementation (2) since cells do not attempt division as frequently. Under implementation (2) (see

kept at stage k (black). Under implementation (1) every cell can be found in any stage of the cell
cycle so it is hard to distinguish the proliferating rim (see figure 6 (b) and (c)). The difference
between the two models however, is not due to aborted proliferation events in the bulk (away from
the rim) but to the ability of cells at the proliferating rim to rapidly undergo a further division
attempt after an aborted attempt under implementation (2) rather than having to complete a
whole new cell cycle as they would under implementation (1). This suggests that the difference
between the two implementations will only be apparent at high densities for which correlations
have built up and significant numbers of division attempts are being aborted.
For low density systems, in which very few particles are adjacent, the mean cell division attempt
times are almost the same for all values of k independent of the implementation ((1) or (2)).
However, the variance in the CCTDs for low density systems affects the rate of growth with

larger values of k (less variance in the CCTD) generally leading to slower growth. This effect
can be understood by considering equations (16) and (19) for a non-excluding population of cells,
for which the finite time and asymptotic time behaviours, respectively, of cell populations with
different values of k can be contrasted.

Fig. 7 The influence of the number of proliferation stages, k, and proliferation rate Pp on the evolution
of average cell density. Parameters, initial conditions and domain descriptions are as in figure 6. Panels
(a)–(c) represent implementation (1) for Pp
0.05, 0.5, 1 respectively. Increasing the number of stages
in the cell cycle causes growth of cell density to be retarded throughout the simulation. Panels (d)–(f)
represent implementation (2) for Pp
0.05, 0.5, 1 respectively. Increasing k causes an initial retardation
in growth followed by an acceleration as the effect of density correlations becomes prevalent. Note that
figures in which Pp 1 are plotted on rescaled time axes for comparison (as described in the main text).

Under implementation (1) (see figure 7 (a)–(c)), even as cell-cell correlations build up, multistage cells still proliferate more slowly than single-stage cells, since the mean division attempt time
remains the same for all values of k, as cells aborting proliferation events are returned to the start
of the cell cycle in each case. As reasoned above for well-mixed systems, the increased variance of
cells with fewer stages results in faster population growth.

A multi-stage representation of cell proliferation as a Markov process

However, under the more realistic implementation (2) (see figure 7 (d)–(f)) cells with multistage cell cycles are able to re-attempt division after abortive division events more quickly than
they otherwise could under the single-stage cell cycle model. Thus, effective average CCTs for cells
with a multi-stage cell cycle at the proliferating rim of a cluster decreases in comparison to cells
with a single-stage cell cycle. The faster the pairwise correlations build up, the more pronounced
this effect becomes. With a very low proliferation rate (in comparison to fixed motility — see figure
7 (d)) cell movement is effective at breaking up correlations meaning that large clusters do not form
and that we only see the effect of decreasing mean CCT for larger values of k at late (scaled) times,
when the density is higher. Contrastingly, when proliferation is high in comparison to motility (see
figure 7 (f)) clusters can form quickly preventing the bulk of cells from proliferating earlier and
allowing the cells with multi-stage cell cycles to divide faster on average at the proliferating rim of
these clusters than their single-stage counterparts.
It is also worth noting that the greater synchrony in cell division times for larger values of k
(exemplified by equations (23)–(24) for the limit of infinite k) is in evidence in the jagged nature
of the yellow curves (corresponding to k

 100) in all six subfigures.

5 Discussion

Currently, many stochastic models which incorporate cell proliferation employ the ubiquitous Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (Gillespie, 1976, 1977). Unfortunately, in its basic form the
Gillespie algorithm represents all events as exponentially distributed. Cell cycle times are not exponentially distributed and can not, therefore be represented by a single reaction event in the
Gillespie algorithm. Modelling cell cycle times as a single exponentially distributed event can lead
to significant alterations in model behaviour in comparison to more appropriate CCTDs. Consequently, we postulated a simple, general hypoexponentially distributed CCT which can be broken
down into exponentially distributed stages allowing for straightforward simulation with the popular Gillespie algorithm. To account for ease of parameter identification we suggested two special

cases of this more general model which have been shown to do an excellent job of recapitulating
CCTDs Golubev (2016).

We postulate that the general hypoexponential distribution (Zhou and Zhuang, 2007) or even
the more specific Erlang (Gibson and Bruck, 2000; Svoboda et al., 1994) or exponentially modified Erlang (Lucius et al., 2003) inter-event distribution time models could be used to allow the
simplified simulation of complex biochemical and biophysical processes (e.g. enzymatic reactions
(Nelson and Cox, 2005), allosteric transitions in ion channels (Qin and Li, 2004), the movement
of molecular motors (Schnitzer and Block, 1995), DNA unwinding (Lucius et al., 2003)) using
the Gillespie algorithm. More generally, non-Markovian processes for which only the inter-event
distribution, rather than the mechanism which generates this distribution, is important might be
simulated efficiently using our proposed mechanism (Floyd et al., 2010; Gibson and Bruck, 2000;
Lucius et al., 2003; Zhou and Zhuang, 2007).

We employed our improved model of cell cycle proliferation times on two recent models of real
biological processes (Baker and Simpson, 2010; Turner et al., 2009). In each case we found that
the incorporation of multiple stages to the cell cycle led to significant differences in the population
size in comparison to the original exponentially distributed CCT model. We suggest that these
difference will hold more generally throughout stochastic models in which CCTs are currently
modelled as exponential.

The application here of hypoexponentially distributed CCTs built up from a number of intermediary exponential stages assumes that the CCT is not correlated between direct descendants or
within a given generation. Whilst there are scenarios in which there is no evidence for a correlation in CCT between related cells (Schultze et al., 1979) there are other situations in which this
assumption is clearly invalid (Duffy et al., 2012; Hawkins et al., 2009). It is possible that some
of these correlation effects can be attributed to the environment in which the cells are proliferating. However, in NIH 3T3 cells a clear correlation has been observed between daughter cells of a
given mitotic event compared to more distant relatives; implying a heritable predisposition (Mort

et al., 2014). Therefore, one obvious extension to this work would be to incorporate the effects of
correlations in cell and phase times to better reflect the biological heterogeneity of a given system.

6 Appendix A - Materials and Methods

In order to determine cell cycle times in cell culture, NIH 3T3 Flp-In cells (Mort et al., 2014) were
seeded at various densities in phenol-red free dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing
10% fetal calf serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 100µg {ml Hygromycin B on glass bottomed
24-well culture plates (Greiner bio-one, UK). The next day, time-lapse imaging was performed
on subconfluent wells with a 20 objective using a Nikon A1R inverted confocal microscope in
a heated chamber supplied with 5% CO2 in air. The time elapsed between mitotic events was
measured using the Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012) distribution of ImageJ - an open source image
analysis package based on NIH Image (Schneider et al., 2012).

SUMMARY
MSH2 is the core protein of MutS-homolog family involved in recognition and repair of
the errors in the DNA. While other members of MutS-homolog family reportedly
regulate mitochondrial stability, meiosis, and fertility, MSH2 is believed to participate
mainly in mismatch repair. The search for polymorphism in MSH2 sequence in tomato
accessions revealed both synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs; however, SIFT
algorithm predicted that none of the SNPs influenced MSH2 protein function. The
silencing of MSH2 gene expression by RNAi led to phenotypic abnormalities in highlysilenced lines, particularly in the stamens with highly reduced pollen formation. MSH2
silencing exacerbated formation of UV-B induced thymine dimers and blocked lightinduced repair of the dimers. The MSH2 silencing also affected the progression of male
meiosis to a varying degree with either halt of meiosis at zygotene stage or formation of
diploid tetrads. The immunostaining of male meiocytes with centromere localized
CENPC (Centromere protein C) protein antibody showed the presence of 48 univalent
along with 24 bivalent chromosomes suggesting abnormal tetraploid meiosis. The
mitotic cells of root tips of silenced lines showed diploid nuclei but lacked intervening
cell plates leading to cells with syncytial nuclei. Thus we speculate that tetraploid pollen
mother cells may have arisen due to the fusion of syncytial nuclei before the onset of
meiosis. It is likely that in addition to Mismatch repair (MMR), MSH2 may have an
additional role in regulating ploidy stability.

INTRODUCTION
The survival of the living organisms is dependent on the precise and error-free
replication of DNA. In addition, normal metabolic activity and environmental factors
such as radiation also cause damage to the DNA. The fidelity of the DNA is ensured by
a cohort of mechanisms that detects and eliminates mistakes occurring during DNA
replication. At least five major repair pathways are known to operate in higher plants:
base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair (MMR) and doublestrand

break

and

nonhomologous end joining (Takata et al., 1998; Guarné et al., 2004; Reardon and
Sancar, 2005; Jacobs and Schär, 2012). Among these, MMR is a major pathway that
corrects base–base and insertion–deletion mismatches generated during DNA
replication or mutagenesis (Dowen et al., 2010; Srivatsan et al., 2014).
MMR is a highly conserved pathway that exists in all living organisms. The
MMR process consists of three key steps: mismatch recognition, excision, and
resynthesis (Ban et al., 1999; Antony and Hingorani, 2003; Guarné et al., 2004). The
first step of the mismatch recognition in eukaryotes is carried out by the homologs of
prokaryotic MutS proteins, namely MSH protein subunits. There are eight homologs of
MutS in eukaryotes: MSH1 to MSH8, of which MSH7 is found only in plants (Culligan
and Hays, 2000) and MSH8 in Euglenozoa (Sachadyn, 2010). The MSH proteins
recognize mismatches as heterodimers, where MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) repairs base-base
mismatches or 1-2 nucleotide insertion-deletion loops (Acharya et al., 1996; Genschel
et al., 1998), while MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3) recognizes larger, up to 14 nucleotide
insertion-deletion loops (Modrich, 1991; Marti et al., 2002). Plants form an additional
heterodimeric complex known as MutSγ (MSH2–MSH7) (Culligan and Hays, 2000)
which recognizes some base–base mismatches and reportedly plays a role in meiotic
recombination (Lloyd et al., 2007). The binding of MutSα/β to mismatched DNA
initiates conformational changes in MutS recruiting MutL complex followed by
activation of exonuclease1/PCNA. The gap generated by DNA excision is filled by
action of DNA polymerase and DNA ligase.
It is reported that the other members of MSH2 family function beyond MMR.
MSH1 is required for mitochondrial stability (Reenan and Kolodner, 1992) and
disruption of MSH1 can influence male sterility in several species (Sandhu et al., 2007;

Zhao et al., 2016). The MSH4 and MSH5 form heterodimer between them without
involving MSH2 and exclusively function in meiosis (Hollingsworth et al., 1995;
Schofield and Hsieh, 2003, Lu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016). The expression of
MSH7 is required for wild-type level of fertility in barley (Lloyd et al., 2007). MSH7
also plays a role in UV-B-induced DNA damage recognition and recombination in
Arabidopsis (Lario et al., 2015).
Among the MMR proteins, MSH2 is a common protein in three of the
heterodimers formed in the plants. In conformity of the role of MSH2 protein in repair
of replication errors, an Arabidopsis mutant defective in MSH2 shows microsatellite
instability (Depeiges et al., 2005). The msh2 mutants in Moss show strong
developmental defects, are sterile and have a mutator phenotype (Trouiller et al., 2006).
A similar phenotype was also observed in Arabidopsis thaliana msh2 mutant lines albeit
only after five generations (Hoffman et al., 2004). Considering that suppression of
MMR leads to an increase in natural mutation frequency, MSH2 gene was silenced in
Nicotiana tabacum and N. plumbaginifolia using an artificial microRNA (amiRNA).
Though the transformed lines showed developmental and morphological abnormality,
the mutant phenotype was not transmitted to subsequent generations (van Marcke and
Angenon, 2013).
Among the interacting partners for MSH2; mutants are reported only for MSH6
and MSH7 in Arabidopsis. The msh6 mutant does not display a visible phenotype (Lario
et al., 2011)

however, msh7 mutant shows an increase in meiotic recombination

frequency (Lario et al., 2015). The role of MSH7 in meiotic recombination is also
reported in tomato, where RNAi silencing of MSH7 improves homeologous meiotic
recombination with a chromosome from S. lycopersicoides (Tam et al., 2011). Most
likely the high increase in meiotic recombination is mediated by the MSH2-MSH7
complex as Arabidopsis msh2 mutant also shows 40% increase in the meiotic crossover
rates (Emmanuel et al., 2006).
In this study, our aim was to isolate MSH2-defective mutants to obtain a
hypermutable line to increase the efficiency of EMS-mutagenesis in tomato. We
screened natural accessions of tomato and EMS-mutagenized lines for SNPs/mutation in
tomato MSH2 by EcoTILLING and TILLING respectively. Considering that little
polymorphism was observed in MSH2 in tomato accessions, we silenced MSH2 gene

using MSH2-RNAi construct. We report that silencing of MSH2 gene led to a
developmental defect in tomato lines with abnormal flowers bearing tetraploid
meiocytes in the anthers. The examination of root cells showed the formation of
syncytial nuclei and defects in the cell plate formation. Our study indicates that MSH2
may also have a role in the regulation of meiotic and mitotic cell divisions.

RESULTS

EcoTILLING of MSH2 gene showed little polymorphism in tomato accessions
Given the pivotal role of MSH2 in MMR, we screened a total of 391 tomato
accessions for polymorphism in the gene. A 2.7 Kb region (4-9 exon) of MSH2
predicted to be deleterious by CODDLE software was chosen for EcoTILLING.
Consistent with the essential nature of the gene, only 7 accessions showed
polymorphism with a total of 13 SNPs with a frequency of 1.23 SNP/100 Kb. (Figure
S1). Among the identified SNPs, 6 were non-synonymous, and 7 were synonymous
(Table 1). The likelihood of non-synonymous SNPs affecting protein function was
examined by SIFT software. Since none of the SNP showed a SIFT score <0.05, these
SNPs were predicted to be non-deleterious in nature. A parallel screening of 1243 bp
region of MSH2 gene covering 4th exon of 11304 tomato EMS-mutagenized lines by
TILLING did not yield any mutation.

Generation of MSH2-RNAi lines
Considering recalcitrance to the mutagenesis and low polymorphism in MSH2
gene, we silenced the gene by RNAi. A 301 bp region of MSH2 gene with no significant
homology to any other tomato gene was amplified and cloned into pHELLSGATE 12
vector (Figure S2). A total of ten independent transgenic lines bearing MSH2-RNAi
construct were raised using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Southern blot
analysis of T 0 lines revealed the presence of the transgene in five lines (Figure S3). In
T 2 generation out of three lines, the lines 1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 with strong MSH2
silencing showed a single transgene copy (Figure S4).

MMR transcript analysis in MSH2-RNAi lines using real-time PCR
To ascertain the magnitude of gene silencing, the level of MSH2 transcript in
transgenic lines was quantified by real-time PCR. Out of five Southern positive lines,
the line 1T 2 1-11 showed ~80% reduction of MSH2 transcript level followed by line
2T 2 5-5 and 2T 2 7-5 compared to wild-type (WT) control (Figure 1). Line 3T 2 1-4
showed moderate, and 5T 2 3-3 showed no reduction in MSH2 transcript levels. The
reduction in the transcript level in line1T21-11 was not restricted to MSH2 alone; it also

reduced the transcript levels of MSH5 and MSH7 albeit to a moderate but a significant
extent. Since, MSH2, MSH5, and MSH7 genes bear no significant sequence homology,
the reduction in MSH5 and MSH7 transcript is most probably due to some indirect
influence of MSH2 transcript reduction.

MSH2 silencing exacerbates UV-B-mediated thymine dimer formation
In mammalian cells, the contribution of the MMR pathway to the UVB-induced
DNA damage is well established (Narine et al., 2007; Seifert et al., 2008). Similarly,
Arabidopsis MSH2 T-DNA insertion lines show higher levels of Cyclobutane
Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD) on exposure to UV-B (Lario et al., 2011, 2015). We used UVB induced thymine dimer formation as an indirect assay to monitor the activity of
MSH2 in transgenic plants in comparison with WT. Pre- and post-UV-B exposure, the
thymine dimers were quantified in genomic DNA of above plants by using a thymine
dimer-specific monoclonal antibody (Figure S5, Figure 2). Prior to UV-B exposure, the
steady-state levels of thymine dimers in control and MSH2 silenced lines were nearly
similar. However, post-6 h UV-B exposure, MSH2 silenced lines showed a high level of
dimers than the control plants. The thymine dimer level in MSH2-RNAi lines was
higher than the control even after 24 h dark or white light incubation (Figure 2). It
appears that high accumulation of thymine dimer in MSH2 transgenic lines may have
resulted from low in-vivo MMR activity.

MSH2-RNAi lines display abnormal pollen formation
The lines 1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 with a higher reduction in MSH2 transcript also
showed phenotypic abnormalities in T 1 and T 2 generation (Figure 3a-f). The most
pronounced abnormality was in the stamen morphology (Figure 3g-h). The plants in
later generations too showed abnormalities in flowers, mostly in the stamens. The
progeny plants of silenced lines either failed to set fruits or set fruits with very few
seeds (Figure 3i-j). These seeds on germination showed a variable degree of viability.
The viable seeds albeit in reduced number were propagated to the next generation.
The examination of pollens revealed that strongly silenced lines produced
pollens with the deformed shape. Unlike WT pollens that were round with a vegetative
and generative cell (Figure 3k-l), the pollens of silenced lines showed the deformed

shape and were either empty or contained the remnant of chromosome fragments
(Figure 3m-n). It is likely that pollen grains collapsed either due to lack of nourishment
in deformed anthers or MSH2-silencing affected some other gene.
The viability of WT and MSH2-RNAi pollens was examined by Alexander
staining. In WT, all pollens exhibited a red-purple fluorescence, strongly reflecting the
high male gametophytic fertility of these plants (Figure 3o). In contrast, MSH2-RNAi
lines such as 1T 2 1-11 displayed mostly inviable pollens (Figure 3p-r). As a
consequence, MSH2-RNAi plants set fruits bearing ca. 5% seeds. The tomato line 1T 2 111 with the highest reduction in MSH2 expression showed a maximum loss in the
fertility with > 90% blue stained pollen grains (Figure 3p). The fruits of 1T 2 1-11 line
bore very few viable seeds along with underdeveloped seeds (Figure 3j).

MSH2-RNAi lines display tetraploid meiosis progression
The deformities in the anther morphology are reported to be associated with
defects in male meiosis in tomato (Rick, 1948; Jeong et al., 2014) and Arabidopsis
(Panoli et al., 2006). Considering that observed stamen abnormalities could be
associated with meiosis, we examined meiosis progression in the MSH2 silenced lines.
The pollen mother cells (PMCs) were isolated at different stages of floral bud
development as outlined by Brukhin et al. (2003) from MSH2 silenced lines and WT. A
complete meiotic progression was examined for WT which progressed normally with
characteristic landmarks for different stages of the meiosis, such as zygotene (Figure
4a), pachytene (Figure 4b), diplotene and diakinesis (Figure 4c-d) followed by
metaphase (Figure 4e), early and late anaphase (Figure 4f-g), early and late telophase
(Figure 4h-i).
In strongly silenced MSH2-RNAi lines, irrespective of the stage of floral bud
development, predominant short condensed chromosomes were observed in the majority
of the meiocytes. These meiocytes were either arrested at the prophase I (Figure 4j-k)
or completed later stages of meiosis (Figure 4l-q). The abnormal increase in the number
of chromosomes in meiocytes was suggestive of either premature loss of sister
chromatid cohesion or increase in ploidy leading to the formation of diploid tetrads
((Figure 4q). In these lines, very few meiocytes were observed with WT complement of
chromosomes.

To quantify the chromosome number in meiotic cells of MSH2-RNAi lines, we
used Centromere Protein C (CENP-C) antibody that speciﬁcally labels the centromere.
Immunolabelling of WT prophase Ι meiocytes with CENP-C antibody showed 12
centromeres at pachytene indicating the likely presence of 12 bivalent chromosomes
(Figure 5a-c). In contrast, the meiocytes of MSH2 silenced line at a stage equivalent to
prophase Ι showed 48 centromeres (Figure 5d-f). There are two possibilities to explain
the presence of 48 centromeres. First, a loss of sister chromatid cohesion in the prophase
I may lead to the appearance of 48 sister chromatids. Second, an increase in ploidy to
tetraploid in the pollen mother cell followed by an absence or delay in sister chromatid
cohesion may result in 48 chromosomes. Analysis of meiotic stages favors the second
scenario where we can observe the occurrence of diploid tetrads where the sister
chromatids separate during anaphase II. Consistent with above, among the meiocytes
examined, most contained 48 chromosomes as signified by CENP-C, however, in few
meiocytes, the meiosis proceeded to anaphase Ι with segregation of 24 chromosomes to
each pole (Figure 5g-i). Beyond this, other stages of meiosis I and meiosis II was rarely
observed indicating a block in the meiosis of the silenced lines. However, a few cells
displayed 12 centromeres indicating that silenced lines generate haploid spores albeit at
highly reduced level.
We observed that only a few tetraploid cells completed meiosis II with the
formation of diploid tetrads at the end of meiosis ΙΙ (Figure 4k-o). The analysis of
relative proportions of meiocytes revealed that in 1T 2 1-11 line, 25% meiocytes
displayed abnormal tetraploid chromosomes, 67% tetraploid meiocytes and 8%
displayed diploid meiosis (Table 2). Similarly, the 2T 2 7-5 line had 25% meiocytes with
abnormal tetraploid and 75% tetraploid nuclei giving rise to diploid microspores.
Consistent with this, the anthers of MSH2 silenced lines contained largely empty
shrunken pollen at the end of meiosis. Taken together these results confirm that MSH2RNAi meiocytes display abnormal meiotic progression resulting in tetraploid meiocytes.
The tetraploid meiocytes were observed only in 1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 lines with high
silencing of MSH2 transcript. The 3T 2 1-4 line with moderate MSH2 silencing and 5T 2 33 line with no MSH2 silencing displayed diploid meiocytes similar to WT (Figure S6).

Analysis of T-DNA integration sites in MSH2-RNAi lines using FPNI-PCR

We also examined whether the tetraploid meiocytes or defect in cytokinesis was
caused by inactivation of some important gene due to insertion of the transgene. To
locate the site of transgene insertion, FPNI-PCR was performed on genomic DNA of
1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 tetraploid MSH2-RNAi lines. The amplified PCR product flanking
the right border of inserted T-DNA was cloned and sequenced. The flanking sequence
of line 1T 2 1-11 showed 98% homology to Tic22 gene in chromosome No. 9 (Table S1,
Figure S7a,b) and that of 2T 2 7-5 showed hit in TRM32 gene, a member of the TON1
Recruiting Motif superfamily (Table S1, Figure S7c,d). While TRM1 reportedly
associates with cortical microtubules, not all TRM proteins associate with microtubules.
Moreover, the sequence diversity among the TRM family members with varied
transcriptional expression patterns indicates that different members may have different
roles (Struk and Dhonukshe, 2014). Considering that both 1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 MSH2RNAi lines show tetraploidy, it is unlikely that insertional inactivation of these genes
leads to tetraploidy in the silenced lines.

Root tip cells show diploid nuclei with sporadic defect in cell plate formation
In the present study, MSH2-RNAi tomato lines generated tetraploid meiocytes.
However, no predominant enlarged organ size, a characteristic of increased ploidy was
observed during the vegetative growth of plants. Even though the silenced lines
displayed abnormal floral organs, these too showed no significant enlargement of floral
structures. To ascertain whether MSH2 silencing leads to tetraploidy in the progeny of
the plants, we examined somatic chromosomal count in root tips of silenced and control
seedlings. The nuclei in WT root tips displayed diploid chromosome number.
Interestingly the MSH2-RNAi lines 1T 2 1-11 and 2T 2 7-5 with tetraploid meiocytes also
displayed diploid chromosomal nuclei in root tip tissues indicating that these plants
were diploid. At the same time, few cells showed no intervening cell wall between the
nuclei suggesting that MSH2 silencing affected the cell plate formation (Figure 6). The
loss of intervening cell wall resulted in the formation of several syncytial nuclei within a
cell (Figure 6e,f). In contrast, the weakly silenced MSH2-RNAi lines with diploid
meiocytes exhibited root tip with uniformly sized diploid nuclei with distinct cell plate
formation (Figure 6c) indicating that loss of cell plate was a feature specific to lines
with a higher degree of MSH2 silencing.

To confirm whether loss of cell plate formation was related to the tetraploidy,
we examined root tips of tomato tetraploid line, LA3255. The root cells of the LA3255
line showed normal tetraploid nuclei with no defect in the cell plate formation (Figure
6d). Consistent with tetraploid nature of the LA3255 line, the staining of root tip nuclei
with DAPI showed larger nuclei in LA3255 line compared to diploid wild-type and
MSH2-RNAi lines nuclei (Figure S8).

DISCUSSION

The DNA mismatch repair is the highly conserved biological pathway that
maintains the fidelity of DNA replication and genetic stability. In the mammalian
system, the defects in MMR lead to abnormalities in meiosis and increases
predisposition to certain types of cancer (Li, 2008). Consistent with the vital role of
MMR, the MSH2 in tomato appeared recalcitrant to mutagenesis, as evident by the
absence of nonsynonymous mutations in M2 lines screened by TILLING. In the
mammalian system, the polymorphism in MSH2 significantly increases the risk of
breast cancer (Hsieh et al., 2016). The paucity of polymorphism in MSH2 as revealed
by EcoTILLING of tomato accessions is in conformity with the indispensable nature of
the gene. Though a missense and few silent mutations were identified, these had no
influence on the protein function as predicted by SIFT.
In plants, the role of MSH2 gene in MMR has been mainly inferred based on its
homology with yeast and mammalian genes. In Arabidopsis, a MSH2 T-DNA
insertional mutation accumulates mutations in microsatellites and other loci indicating a
role of MSH2 in MMR (Leonard et al., 2003; Hoffman et al., 2004). MSH2 reportedly
plays a role in repair of the UV-B induced DNA damage in the mammalian system,
(Peters et al., 2003; Seifert et al., 2008). In plants as well, MSH2 likely plays a role in
the repair of UV-B induced Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD). The Arabidopsis
MSH2 mutant on UV-B exposure shows enhanced formation of CPD suggesting a role
of MSH2 in the repair of UV-B damage (Lario et al., 2011). Similarly, in strongly
silenced tomato MSH2-RNAi lines, thymine dimer formation is exacerbated by
exposure to UV-B. Also, MSH2-deficient plants show inefficient repair of thymine
dimers even on exposure to visible light that stimulates photoreactivation repair. From
the preceding, it is apparent that strongly silenced MSH2-RNAi lines have low in vivo
MMR activity as evident by enhanced UV-B damage.
The propagation of Arabidopsis MSH2 T-DNA insertional mutant line revealed
the accumulation of a wide variety of mutations such as morphological abnormalities,
reduction in seed/silique development and loss of germination efficiency (Hoffman et
al., 2004). Analogously, strongly silenced tomato MSH2-RNAi lines also show multiple
abnormalities throughout the plant development, mainly during floral development with

abnormal anthers. The lines with abnormal stamens showed reduced fruit set and highly
reduced seed numbers in the fruits. In contrast to Arabidopsis MSH2 mutant lines where
seed set on average was reduced to only 50% (Hoffman et al., 2004), in tomato silenced
lines, it was less than 10%.
The reduction in seed set can result from the failure in the embryo development.
Considering that the MSH2 silenced lines developed abnormal anthers, reduced seed set
may have resulted from the failure to make viable pollens in the deformed anthers.
Consistent with this, Alexander staining showed nonviable pollens with blue staining in
highly silenced lines. Since WT and moderately silenced lines showed viable pollens
with red staining, it can be assumed that MSH2 silencing leads to loss of pollen viability
in tomato. Thus the reduced seed set in the silenced lines is in conformity with the loss
of pollen viability.
The successful pollen development in plants requires operation of proper
meiosis in the developing anther (Ma, 2005). In several plants defects in the anther
formation are associated with defective meiosis or meiotic arrest (Walbot and Egger,
2016). In tomato, heat-induced abnormal anther development in a conditional male
sterile mutant is associated with reduced pollen set and loss of pollen viability (Rick and
Boynton, 1967). It is, therefore, likely that silencing of MSH2 expression affected
anther development that in turn may have affected the progression of meiosis.
Consistent with this view, the MSH2 silenced lines showed a meiotic arrest in
the anthers. The majority of pollen mother cells (PMC) of MSH2-RNAi lines fail to
complete the meiotic cycle. These PMCs initiate meiosis as evident by the onset of
zygotene. However, the meiosis gets stalled at the final stage of prophase I – diakinesis,
as the chromosomes are at their most condensed form. The stalling at diakinesis is
seemingly related to the increase in the ploidy as CENP-C stained cells showed the
presence of 48 univalent chromosomes. The stalling of the meiosis is not total, as few
CENP-C stained cells also showed 24 bivalent chromosomes, which completed meiosis
presumably generating diploid pollens. However, most pollens were shrunken, and only
a few showed Alexander staining. It is plausible that loss of pollen viability was largely
for the diploid pollens. From the preceding, it is likely that incomplete meiosis and the
formation of nonviable pollens contribute to the reduced seed set in the stronglysilenced MSH2-RNAi lines.

The process that generates tetraploid nuclei in the PMC remains to be
investigated. In several plants including tomato during microsporogenesis, the nuclei
can transfer to the neighboring cell by cytomixis (Weiling, 1965; Mursalimov et al.,
2013). Such intercellular transfer of nuclei can influence the ploidy level of the produced pollens. However, such cytomictic transfer of nuclei most probably does not
contribute to tetraploid nuclei, as in tomato cytomixis is observed only ca. 15% of PMC
(Weiling, 1965). The occurrence of a large number of polyploid pollen mother cells
does not favor cytomixis to be the cause of tetraploid nuclei. The probability that
tetraploid meiocytes arise due to MSH2-silencing-induced endomitosis also seems
remote. In Chrysanthemum, the fusion of two PMC forms tetraploids, albeit this process
occurs at very low frequency (Kim et al., 2009), and cannot account for high numbers
of tetraploid meiocytes in MSH2 silenced lines.
The root cells of MSH2-RNAi-silenced lines show defective cytokinesis with
multiple nuclei in syncytial cells. The similar syncytial cells may also form due to
defective cytokinesis during meiocytes archesporial cells development. It is likely that
the fusion of nuclei in syncytial cells gives rise to the tetraploid nuclei in PMC of
MSH2-RNAi-silenced lines. The fusion of nuclei resulting in the stochastic formation of
tetraploid PMC initials has been documented in mutants defective in cell plate
formation. In Arabidopsis, the mutations in sterol methyl transferase and callose
synthase lead to defect in cell plate formation predominantly in the floral tissues. Both
mutants also form tetraploid meiocytes and diploid gametes in both male and female
sporogenesis (de Storme et al., 2013). The formation of tetraploid meiocytes in MSH2
silenced lines is analogous to tomato pmcd1 mutant, where cytokinesis failure in
meiocytes archesporial cells generates tetraploid nuclei (de Storme and Geelan, 2013a).
The MSH2 silenced lines show the formation of the very few viable pollens and
the progeny of these plants were exclusively diploid. The strongly reduced seed set in
silenced lines seems to indicate that only diploid embryos survived post-fertilization.
Another reason could be defective endosperm development due to unbalanced 1:1 ratio
rather than normal 1:2 ratio of the paternal and maternal genome (Scott et al., 1998).
The absence of triploid progeny may also result from the existence of strong triploid
block in members of Solanaceae including tomato (Ehlenfeldt and Ortiz 1995; Nilsson,
1950). The absence of triploid or tetraploid progeny in MSH2-RNAi lines is also

consistent with the reported absence of triploid/tetraploid plants in progeny of tomato
pmcd1 mutant that shows a cytokinesis defect and generates diploid pollens (de Storme
and Geelan, 2013a)
The

pre-meiotic

doubling

of

chromosome

occurs

in

unisexual

and

parthenogenetically reproducing animal species (Itono et al., 2006). It is believed that in
higher plants such chromosomal doubling rarely occurs (de Storme and Geelan, 2013b).
In higher plants, the doubling of chromosomes reportedly occurs after the onset of
meiosis via meiotic restitution (de Storme and Geelan, 2013b). Considering that
doubling of chromosomes in MSH2 silenced line occurs before the onset of meiosis, it is
of a novel nature. The very high frequency of tetraploid meiocytes also hints for a likely
function of MSH2 in the regulation of chromosomal doubling via a mechanism that
remains to be deciphered.

Since the formation of tetraploid meiocytes in MSH2

silenced line is quite similar to pmcd1 mutant, the failure of cytokinesis appears to be
the main contributor to this phenomenon.
In plants, MSH2 heterodimerizes with MSH3, MSH6, and MSH7. However,
none of these heterodimers reportedly have any function in the regulation of meiosis.
Conversely, the MSH4 and MSH5 mutants in Arabidopsis and rice though exhibit
normal vegetative growth, show severe fertility reduction likely related to meiotic
defects (Higgins et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016). The
MSH2-silenced lines also affected MSH5 and MSH7 transcript levels which may have
affected the process of meiosis. The manifested tetraploid meiocytes formation and later
failure in meiosis might be due to the reduction of these three transcripts. Alternately,
the increased microsatellite instability caused due to low activity of the MSH2 protein
may contribute to defective cytokinesis and tetraploid meiocytes formation.
Similar to MSH2 silencing, loss of function lines in 40S ribosomal protein S6
kinases in Arabidopsis generate tetraploid PMCs and show a high degree of pollen
abortion (Henriques et al., 2010). Likewise, mutations in glucan synthase-like 8 and
sterol methyl transferase 2 lead to defects in somatic cell plate formation and the
occasional fusion of syncytial nuclei (Chen et al., 2009; Guseman et al., 2010). It is,
therefore, likely that T-DNA insertion in a meiosis/cytokinesis related gene may have
caused the tetraploidy. The examination of two silenced lines indicated insertion in
TIC22 and TRM32 genes; both of these genes have no reported role in meiosis or cell

plate formation.

Despite having an insertion in widely unrelated genes, both the

silenced lines showed identical phenotype suggesting a close correlation between MSH2
silencing and tetraploidy.
The tetraploid formation in MSH2 silenced lines is more akin to the proposal
that DNA replication or repair defects might produce signals that block cytokinesis and
yield tetraploids in cancer cells (Ganem et al., 2007). While it is not reported in plants,
in mice embryo fibroblasts, deficiency of MSH2 in conjunction with P53 revealed that
MSH2 plays a role in preventing polyploidization of cells (Strathdee et al., 2001). In
mammalian cells, MSH2 has been identified as a target of the E2F transcription factors
(Ren et al., 2002) wherein the loss of MSH2 inhibits the interaction of E2F with MSH2,
thus affecting the E2F signaling. It is believed that disruption of the E2F signaling
affects the progression of cell cycle and promotes failure of cytokinesis. Since MSH2
have a probable role in mammalian cytokinesis, it is plausible that MSH2 may affect
cytokinesis in plants in a similar fashion. Nonetheless, it remains to be determined
whether MSH2 alone or with its interacting partners plays a direct or an indirect role in
regulation ploidy and cytokinesis in plants. It is also likely that MSH2 silencing leads to
wide ramification in plant cells and observed change in the ploidy level reflect its
downstream effect.
In summary, our study indicates that MSH2 silencing leads to tetraploid
meiocytes formation in tomato. Additionally, MSH2 silencing also affects cytokinesis
with multiple nuclei in syncytial cells. Though the precise mechanism of MSH2 action
remains to be deciphered, these phenotypes indicate an additional role for MSH gene
family. Our results also suggest that similar to cytomixis, the formation of syncytial
cells may contribute to the tetraploid formation in higher plants. Uncovering the role of
MSH2 in the regulation of cytokinesis and nuclear fusion will be of great interest in
future studies and may contribute to an alternate route to the polyploid formation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Screening for SNPs/mutations in MSH2 gene
The population used for the EcoTILLING was same as described earlier in
Mohan et al. (2016) and Upadhyaya et al. (2017). Genomic DNA was isolated from
tomato accessions or EMS-mutagenized M 2 lines following the procedure of
Sreelakshmi et al. (2010). MSH2 gene sequence was obtained from SGN
(solgenomics.net, Solyc06g069230). CODDLE software (blocks.fhcrc.org/ proweb/
coddle) was used to predict the most deleterious region of the gene. The primers for
SNP/mutation

screening

were

designed

using

Primer3web

version

4.0.0

(bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3). (Table S2). The SNP/mutation detection and haplotype
assignment were carried out as described by Mohan et al. (2016).

The sequence

variations (Substitutions and Indels) were detected by using ‘Multalin’ software
(http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/, Corpet (1988). The SNP frequency was
calculated using the formula: (Total number of SNPs detected / total length of the
screened fragment) X 1000 (Frerichmann et al., 2013). PARSESNP (Taylor and
Greene, 2003) was used to analyze and display the variation in gene sequences, and
SIFT (Sorting intolerant from tolerant; Sim et al., 2012) was used to predict the
deleterious variations for protein functions.

Cloning of a fragment of MSH2 gene in pHELLSGATE 12 RNAi vector
For RNAi silencing, a 301 bp region in 4th exon of MSH2 showing no significant
homology with any other tomato gene was selected. The 301 bp region from MSH2
cDNA was PCR amplified using primers set with the attB sequence at the 5ʹ end (FPAGATTCTCCAGTGATTGTTGCT; RP- CAGATCCTGTACCAAATCCCTA).. The
PCR product was cloned into a pDONR201 vector with attP1 and attP2 sites using BP
Clonase enzyme (Invitrogen). The gene fragment from the intermediate clone was
transferred to the pHELLSGATE12 vector (CSIRO, Australia) by recombination
between attL1/attL2 and attR1/attR2, mediated by LR Clonase enzyme (Invitrogen).
The confirmed clone was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 strain.

Generation of MSH2-RNAi lines
Tomato (cv. Arka Vikas) transformation was performed as described earlier

(Sharma et al., 2009) yielding ten independent transgenic lines. The phenotyping of the
transgenic plants was continually carried out in successive generations. The lines with
80-90% MSH2 transcript silencing showed anther abnormalities. Therefore these lines
were manually pollinated to propagate to next generation. Nonetheless, few T 2 lines
with very strong anther-defects did not survive as they produced insufficient viable
pollens and failed to set fruits. The plants were carried forward till T 4 generation. The
following nomenclature was adopted for progressive generations; Line No. 2T 0
indicates T 0 line No.2, 2T 1 5 indicates T 1 progeny No. 5 of Line No. 2, 2T 2 5-7 indicates
its T 2 progeny No. 7 of T 1 plant No.5 of T 0 Line No. 2.

Southern blot analysis
Genomic DNA (~15 µg) of T 0 transgenic lines was digested with BamHI and
SalI to release a fragment size of 2.2Kb (Figure S3), while genomic DNA (~15 µg) of
T 2 transgenic lines was digested EcoRΙ or NotΙ or PacΙ (Figure S4) at 37°C overnight,
separated on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes. αP32dCTP labeled 2.2 Kb BamHI, and SalI digested (Figure S3) and NPTΙΙ (Figure S4)
fragment was synthesized by PCR and used as the probe. The primers for amplification
of NPTΙΙ probe amplify a 554 bp fragment in the coding region of NPTΙΙ.
Prehybridization, hybridization, washing and developing of the blot was performed
according to Sambrook and Russell (2001).

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR
RNA was isolated from young leaves with three independent replicates using the
method as described earlier (Gupta et al., 2014). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was
prepared from 2 µg of RNA using high-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied
Biosystems, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR was also performed as described earlier
by (Gupta et al., 2014). Gene-specific primers were designed from the sequences
obtained from the SGN database using Primer 3 software (Table S3) while real-time
data analysis were same as described by (Gupta et al., 2014).

Analysis of in-vivo MSH2 activity

The in-vivo MSH2 activity was determined by measuring the amount of thymine
dimer formation on exposure to UV-B light as described by Lario et al. (2011, 2015).
Three samples of juvenile 6th to 7th node leaves were exposed for 6 h to UV-B radiation
(2 Wm-2, TL 20 W/01-RS, Philips narrowband) in dark room at 22°C. Wild-type leaves
were treated similarly albeit without UV-B radiation. One sample was frozen at the end
of 6 h treatment. The second and third sample were transferred to the darkness and
white light (100 µmol m-2 sec-1) respectively for 24 h. Samples were snap frozen and
stored at -80°C till DNA extraction and thymine dimer determination.
The UV-B induced thymine dimers were quantified as described by Stapleton et
al. (1993). Six µg of genomic DNA isolated from UV-B treated and control leaves was
denatured, dot blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Perkin Elmer life Sciences, Inc.)
and baked at 80°C. The membrane was blocked, washed and incubated with thymine
dimer-specific monoclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2000 in TBS) for 3 h at room
temperature with gentle agitation. The dimers were visualized by incubating with
alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, 1:3000) and detection by
nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reaction. The bands
were quantified by densitometry using Image J software. The thymine dimers were
quantified using three independent biological replicates. However, in the figures, a
single representative blot and the values derived from it using ImageJ software is
shown.

Meiotic Chromosome Preparation
Floral buds at the appropriate stages of the meiosis were picked according to
Brukhin et al. (2003). The buds were fixed and stored in Carnoy’s solution [ethanol:
chloroform: glacial acetic acid, (6:3:1)] at 4°C or -20°C. Fixed inflorescences were
rinsed with Ethanol: glacial acetic acid (3:1) at defined intervals. Procedure for meiotic
chromosome preparation was same as described by (Ross et al., 1997). Chromosomes
were counterstained with AT-specific fluorescent dye, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 1 µg/ml) (Sigma Laboratories). All images were captured using a 63X (1.4
N.A.) oil-immersion objective on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Images were
further processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6.

Mitotic Chromosome Preparation
Roots tips (1.5-2 cm) from 5-day-old seedlings were fixed in Carnoy’s solution
for 24 h followed by washing with 70% (v/v) ethanol (15 min. 3X) and storage at 4°C.
Procedure for mitotic chromosome preparation was same as described by (Babich et al.,
1997). Then the tips were observed at 100X under Nikon compound microscope (Nikon
Eclipse 80i) and photographed (Nikon NIS elements Basic version 3.1). Root tip nuclei
were also assessed for nuclear size in somatic tissue by fixing in ethanol:acetic acid
(3:1) fixative for at least 1 h, cleared in 70% ethanol and stained with 1µg/mL 4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution.

Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence, synaptonemal complexes were prepared as described
by Ross et al. (1997) and Chelysheva et al. (2010). 60% (v/v) acetic acid treatment
was done at 45°C for 5 min with continuous stirring with a hook to remove maximum
cytoplasm debris. Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI and observed under
the microscope to ensure proper slide preparation. The slides were microwaved in 10
mM citrate buffer pH 6 for 45s at 850 W for proper fixing of the chromosomes to slides.
Slides were first immersed in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBST): pH 7.4
containing 0.01% (v/v) TritonX-100 for 2×5 minutes. To block non-specific antibody
binding, 100 µl of blocking buffer [1% (w/v) BSA in PBS] was applied directly to the
slides. 100 µl of primary CENPC (Centromere protein C) antibody (1:100) in blocking
buffer [PBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton + 1% (w/v) BSA] was applied directly to the slides,
covered with parafilm and incubated overnight at 4°C in a moist chamber. The slides
were washed (2×5 minutes) with PBST before adding 100 µl of the secondary antibody.
Secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit 488 (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:500) was
incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Finally, the slides were washed for 2×5
minutes and mounted in DAPI (10 µg/ml) in Vectashield antifade mounting medium.
Slides were examined using a 63X (1.4 N.A.) oil-immersion objective on a Leica SP5
confocal microscope. Images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6.

To locate the unknown sequences flanking the insertion sites in the transgenic
lines, FPNI-PCR described by Wang et al. (2011) with few modifications was used. The
primers used for the FPNI-PCR are listed in Table S4. The cycling conditions were
followed according to Wang et al. (2011). All PCR products were electrophoresed on a
2.0% (w/v) agarose gel and FPNI-PCR products showing sizes more than 500 bp were
chosen for sequencing. The purified PCR product was sequenced using Sanger
sequencing (Macrogen, South Korea). The sequences were aligned to the tomato
genome sequence (Sol Genomics Network, https://solgenomics.net/) using BLAST
program.

Abstract
Viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to interact with host cells for their adaptive
benefits, including subverting host immune responses and hijacking host DNA
replication/transcription machineries [1â3]. Although interactions between viral and host
proteins have been studied extensively, little is known about how the vial genome may
interact with the host genome and how such interactions could affect the activities of both
the virus and the host cell. Since the three-dimensional organization of a genome can have
significant impact on genomic activities such as transcription and replication, we
hypothesize that such structure-based regulation of genomic functions also applies to viral
genomes depending on their association with host genomic regions and their spatial
locations inside the nucleus. Here, we used Tethered Chromosome Conformation Capture
(TCC) to investigate viral-host genome interactions between the adenovirus and human
lung fibroblast cells. We found viral-host genome interactions were enriched in certain
active chromatin regions and chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. The contacts by
viral DNA seems to impact the structure and function of the host genome, leading to
remodeling of the fibroblast epigenome. Our study represents the first comprehensive
analysis of viral-host interactions at the genome structure level, revealing unexpectedly
specific virus-host genome interactions. The non-random nature of such interactions
indicates a deliberate but poorly understood mechanism for targeting of host DNA by
foreign genomes.

Background
Upon infection, viruses deliver viral proteins and genetic materials into host cells either
embracing or confronting the host cellular machineries. A variety of virally evolved
adaptive mechanisms lead to dynamic virus-host interactions at every stage of the viral life
cycleâall intended to increase the likelihood of generating progeny virions. A key aspect
of viral regulation is the transcription of viral genes and the replication of viral genomes.
Many RNA and DNA viruses introduce DNA into the host cell nucleus. Retrovirus and
lentivirus RNA genomes also enter the nucleus as double stranded DNA, which is
synthesized by virion-associated reverse transcriptase in cytoplasm. The genome of DNA
viruses is packaged at very high molecular density with specialized viral packaging
proteins to form a capsid virion particle. Upon entering the cell nucleus, virion particles
interact with host activating factors in decondensing the incoming viral DNA to initiate
viral transcription and replication or establish a stable intermediate for latent infection or
long-term integration [4,5].
After nuclear entry, the viral genomes distribute inside the nucleus through a non-random
but poorly understood process. For DNA viruses, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
imaging analyses show nuclear deposition of viral DNA and subsequent viral gene
transcription at the periphery of Nuclear Domain 10âs (ND10s), which are also known as
PML nuclear bodies (NBs) and PML oncogenic domains (PODs) [6,7]. ND10 is a highly

organized nuclear structure accumulated with interferon-upregulated proteins, implicating
ND10s as sites of a nuclear defense mechanism. ND10 subcompartments often reside
adjacent to nuclear speckles, a nuclear domain enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors.
DNA viruses initiate their transcription at ND10s juxtaposed to nuclear speckles. After the
expression of viral immediate early gene products, ND10s subsequently become dispersed.
The dynamic co-localizations of DNA virus genomes and host nuclear domains at defined
stages of viral life cycle strongly suggest a functional role of viral-host genomic
interactions. However, because of the limited resolution of FISH and its low throughput,
the molecular and chromatin compositions of these nuclear domains and their interactions
with viral DNA are not fully characterized. Little is known about whether the virus genome
associates with specific host chromosomal regions.
Extensive studies suggest that nuclear organization, including the proximity of genomic
loci and their positions inside the nucleus, play important roles in regulating transcription
and DNA replication [8â10]. In addition to early image-based analyses, recently developed
chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques are able to capture chromosomal
interactions at fine resolution and in high-throughput (Hi-C) when coupled with next
generation sequencing [11,12]. These studies reveal a hierarchical organization of
chromosome structuresâincluding contact domains [13], topological associated domains
[14], macro-domains [15], and chromatin compartments A/B [12] âthat can be
functionally related to gene expression, chromatin modifications, DNA replication timing,
etc. These studies raise the possibility that viruses may have to adapt to or alter the host
nuclear environment and genome structure to regulate the viral life cycle. To reveal whether
virus-host genome interactions are specific, we used a 3C/Hi-C based approach to

investigate the viral host genome interactions. However, solution-based 3C methods such
as Hi-C suffer from high background noise [15â18], such that rare DNA interactions,
including interchromosomal contacts as well as virus-host genome interactions to be
studied here, may be difficult to detect. Alternative approaches, such as the solid phase
chromosome conformation capture technique, also known as TCC [15], and the recently
developed in situ Hi-C and single-cell Hi-C [13,19], minimize the noise levels originating
from random DNA ligations and could be adopted to investigate virus-host genome
interactions. In this study, we used TCC and the adenovirus/fibroblast model to explore
virus-host genome interactions and its potential functional implications.
The adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus containing a linear double stranded DNA genome.
It is the first human virus that was found to cause tumors in hamster [20]. This tumor
promoting activity led to extensive studies of the molecular and cell biology of adenovirus
infection [21]. Among the human adenoviruses, serotype 5 (Ad5) is an extensively
characterized strain, which has a ~36 kb linear dsDNA genome and encodes ~39 viral genes
[22].
Here we identified genome-wide adenovirus-host genome interactions and observed that
the interactions are not randomly distributed across the host genome. Host-viral genome
interactions preferentially occur in specific regions of the host genome that are associated
with open and early replicating chromatin. At the same time, these regions are also enriched
with specific histone modifications, such as H3K27me3, which is not normally associated
with active chromatin but is critical in regulating cell differentiation [23]. Interestingly, the
viral DNA attachment sites coincide with locations undergoing early host epigenome
remodeling upon viral infection. We found a correlation between the observed frequencies

of a host-viral DNA interaction and the extent of acetylation of H3K18 and H3K9 (in the
presence of RB and p300), which are part of the observed epigenetic remodeling of the
host genome upon adenoviral infection [24â27]. This observation raises the possibility that
the locations of viral DNA in the host genome may be mechanistically linked to the
dramatic epigenetic changes in the host genome upon viral infection.

Results and Discussions
Genome-wide interactions between adenovirus and host genome
We used TCC to map genome-wide chromatin interactions between the adenovirus and
host genomes. We used the small E1A (e1a) adenovirus 5 construct (dl1500) that mainly
expresses the small e1a oncoprotein [28]. The âearly region 1aâ (E1A) of the human Ad5
genome generates two splice variants, the smaller of which (i.e., small e1a) is responsible
for activating early viral genesâ expression and the virus-induced host cell transformation.
The e1a oncoprotein can drive contact-inhibited human fibroblast cells into S phase in part
by displacing the RB cell cycle checkpoint protein from the E2F master transcription
factors [29] without causing host nucleus destruction in the lytic infection cycle. Extensive
studies have demonstrated that e1a is crucial for remodeling the host epigenome leading to
oncogenic transformation of the cell [24â26,29]. Thus, the dl1500 construct serves as a
good model for our studies. TCC experiments were performed on human primary lung
fibroblasts (IMR90) with and without dl1500 adenovirus infection for different durations
at 6 and 24 hours post infection (p.i.). For the two datasets with virus infection, we
preprocessed (Methods) the pair-end sequencing reads and aligned them to both human

(hg19) and adenovirus 5 (Ad5) genomes. Pair-end reads aligned to hg19 on one end and to
Ad5 on the other end were described as virus-host genome interactions (VGIs). 156,666
VGIs and 460,988 VGIs were identified at 6 and 24 hours p.i., respectively. Pair-end reads
with both ends aligned to hg19 are host chromosomal interactions (CIs). For
intrachromosomal interactions only pair-end reads with end reads separated by a sequence
distance of at least 20 kb were considered. The absolute numbers of reads for each
interaction type (CIs and VGIs) in all four datasets are shown in Table S1. VGIs consist of
0.12% and 0.43% of all detected interactions in the 6 and 24 hours p.i. data sets,
respectively (Figure 1a).
The amount of adenovirus DNA in the nucleus of an infected cell can be calculated from
the size of the adenovirus 5 genome (~36 kb) multiplied by the multiplicity of infection
(MOI), which is the ratio of the infectious adenovirus particles to the number of targeted
fibroblast cells. An MOI of 200 was used for all virus infection experiments to ensure near
complete infection of all cells in culture. The total amount of DNA consists of the diploid
female human genome (IMR90) and the viral DNA. The expected DNA capturing rate,
defined as the ratio of the viral DNA to the total amount of nuclear DNA, is 0.14%, which
is similar in value to the total fraction of VGI among all detected DNA interactions in the
6 hours p.i. TCC dataset (Figure 1a). This value indicates the TCC method is robust in
capturing virus-host genome interactions.
To analyze the genome-wide distribution of VGIs, the host genome was tiled into binning
windows at different resolutions. Given the current sequencing depth, a resolution of 500
kb binning windows was chosen as the optimal resolution to represent VGIs at the given
sequencing depth (Methods and Figure S1). Chromosomal interactions (CIs) were also

binned to 500 kb windows to build the Observed genome-wide raw Contact count (OC)
matrices.
For 3C-based experiments, the number of contacts observed for different genomic regions
may be biased by differences in DNA sequence and chromatin features, such as restriction
enzyme digestion efficiency, sequence mappability, GC content, etc [30â32]. Based on the
âequal visibilityâ assumption, the genome-wide OC matrices of the four datasets were
normalized by balancing the marginal sum of the matrices through the iterative correction
(ICE) method to obtain the contact frequency (CF) matrices [33] (See Methods for the
details of data processing). To accurately account for the VGI contact frequency, the
observed raw counts of VGI were normalized by the bias vector generated from ICE
normalization method (Methods). VGI contact frequencies at 6 and 24 hours p.i. were
therefore represented by two contact profile vectors with dimension of 5,689 bins spanning
the entire hg19 genome. The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient between the two vectors is
0.768 indicating that VGI positions are consistent between the two samples and are not
randomly distributed. Genome-wide VGIs together with their contact frequencies are
displayed in figure 1b, which shows the non-uniform distribution of VGIâs in the human
genome for both datasets at 6 and 24 hours p.i.
Identification of viral DNA enriched regions on the host genome
The enrichment of VGIs at a genomic region was determined by hypothesis testing with a
null model assumption of multinomial distribution (Figure 1c; Methods). As results, 222
and 731 bins were identified as viral DNA enriched bins for the 6 and 24 hours p.i. samples,
respectively. 173 (79%) of the VGI enriched bins in the 6 hours p.i. data set were also found

in the 24 hours p.i. sample (Figure 1d). Since viral DNA does not replicate at early infection
stages [24], the 222 viral DNA enriched bins identified at 6 hours p.i. are likely the primary
genomic locations where adenovirus DNA interacts with the host genome as it is delivered
into the host cell nucleus.
Viral DNA enriched regions co-localize in 3D space prior to infection
Previous FISH imaging analyses showed that the adenovirus genome is deposited to
specific nuclear domains (ND10s) at the early stages of viral infection [7]; and that ND10s
segregated equally and had symmetric positions in daughter nuclei after cell division [34],
which indicates viral DNA genome deposition follows certain chromosomal bases.
Moreover, ND10s are frequently situated next to DNA replication foci and specific gene
loci [6]. These observations suggest that the viral genome prefers certain larger host
chromosomal locations or subcompartments within the nucleus.
To investigate the existence of large chromosomal subcompartments involved in viral-host
genome interactions, we tested if the 222 chromatin regions enriched with VGIs at the 6
hours p.i. are clustered in 3D space before the viral infection. The 222 bins can form up to
1507 bin pairs of intrachromosomal interactions in the 6 hours mock-infection (m.i.) TCC
dataset (Figure 2a). Within a chromosome, genomic regions generally tend to interact more
frequently when they are separated by shorter sequence distances. Therefore, we performed
a sequence distance restricted sampling test to rule out bias with respect to sequence
proximity on the interaction frequency. For each intrachromosomal pair of the 1507 VGI
regions, a pair of bins is randomly selected from the same chromosome with identical
sequence distance separation to the VGI pair. The distance restricted sampling procedure

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142604. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

was repeated for 10,000 times, generating 10,000 random bin pairs of intrachromosomal
interactions. In this analysis VGI bins had a statistically significantly higher probability (pvalue less than 10-4) to colocalize with each other in comparison to other bins with the same
sequence separation, as is evident from the distributions of pairwise contact frequencies
for VGI regions and random control (Figure 2b). Intrachromosomal long-range interactions
define chromosome sub compartments, such as compartment A and compartment B regions.
Chromosome regions within each compartment tend to co-localize with other regions in
the same compartment [12]. On one hand, out of the 5,689 500-kb bins in the genome,
2483 (43.6%) are classified as compartment A regions in the 6 hours p.i. TCC dataset. On
the other hand, out of the 222 500kb bins enriched with VGIs at 6 hours p.i., 148 (66.7%)
are classified as compartment A regions. Therefore, the observed VGI colocation could be
a reflection of its compartment A preference. To investigate if the VGI colocation is
influenced by compartment A/B segregation, we repeated the distance restricted sampling
test for the 148 VGI bins in compartment A in comparison to all the 2483 bins in
compartment A. Also in this analysis, the p-value was less than 0.005, which indicates that
viral genome colocation is not solely driven by its compartment A preference.
Interestingly, our analysis indicates that VGI bins can be clustered according to their
contact frequency profiles into 2 to 3 larger groups (i.e. subcompartments) per chromosome,
so that VGI regions within each domain showed substantially increased interaction
frequencies in comparison to interactions to VGI regions in another domain. These spatial
subcompartments are visually evident when plotting the contact frequency heatmaps
formed by only VGI bins (Figure 2a). These subcompartments could be candidates for

nuclear domains associated with early viral infection, such as the previously identified
ND10s [7].
Viral DNA preferentially interacts with active host chromatin regions and chromatin
regions marked by histone modification H3K27me3
The genome-wide chromosome conformation capture data of IMR90 is able to classify the
host genome into at least two distinct compartments, A and B, based on the TCC interaction
patterns [12,15]. In addition to the spatial distinction between different compartments,
compartment A regions are also characterized by active chromatin features including an
early replication timing profile, while compartment B regions are recognized as âinactiveâ
regions [12,15]. Figure 3a shows the assignment of compartment A and B for chromosome
2. For the entire genome, VGI frequencies for regions of compartment A were significantly
higher than those in chromatin regions of compartment B (with studentâs t-test p-value less
than 10-15) (Figure 3b). Among the 222 VGI enriched bins at 6 hours p.i., 148 (66.7%)
belong to compartment A, while for the whole genome 2483 (43.6%) out of 5689 bins are
part of compartment A. VGI frequency distributions for regions in compartments A and B
in all chromosomes are detailed in Table S2.
We also compared VGI frequencies for regions in different cytogenic categories. The mean
VGI frequency decreases with increasing Giemsa staining levels (for bins in categories
ranging from âgnegâ to the âgpos100â cytogenetic categories) (Figure 3c). Centromeric
stained regions (categorized as âacenâ in Figure 3c) are heterochromatic and have the
lowest average VGI frequencies. This observation also suggests that the adenovirus

genome interacts less frequently with heterochromatin and much more so with active
euchromatin regions.
We further analyzed the viral-host genome contacts in the context of data from DNase I
hypersensitivity assays (Figure S2) and ChIP-seq assays of various histone modifications
(Figure 3d). These analyses indicated that viral DNA preferentially interacts with active
open chromatin regions. For instance, the 222 VGI enriched regions at 6 hours p.i. show a
similar histone modification profile as those in compartment A regions (denoted as VGI
and A, respectively, in Figure 3d), whose histone modification markers typically are
associated with actively transcribed chromatin regions such as H3K4me1, H3Kme2,
H3K27ac, H3K79me1 and H3K79me2 [35,36]. Histone modifications H3K27ac and
H3K4me1 were previously shown to be defining features of active enhancer regions [36].
Even the 74 VGI regions classified as being part of the B compartment (denoted as VGI_B
in Figure 3d) showed higher fold change for histone modifications associated with active
open chromatin (i.e. H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, etc.) compared with the chromatin
regions in the B compartment (denoted as B in Figure 3d). In addition, we observed a strong
negative correlation (Pearsonâs correlation coefficient = -0.39 in Figure S2) and a depleted
fold change (fold change = 0.5 in Figure 3d) between the VGI frequency profile and the
occurrence profile of histone modification H3K9me3, which is a marker for
heterochromatin regions [37,38]. These observations suggest that viral DNA-host genome
interactions occur preferentially in active open chromatin regions. This enrichment could
be the result of preferential binding of the viral genome to active chromatin regions, an
increased viral DNA replication in these active regions, active exclusion from
heterochromatin, or combinations of these mechanisms. Since our analyses were based on

data from 6 hours p.i. when no significant viral replication is taking place, and viral DNA
interacts with specific regions of host euchromatin, we favor the interpretation that the viral
genome preferentially interacts with open active chromatin regions.
Interestingly, histone marker H3K27me3, which is associated with Polycomb-group
silencing [35,23], is strongly enriched in the VGI genomic regions (VGI, VGI_A, and
VGI_B in Figure 3d), even though it antagonizes H3K27ac, a histone modification
enriched in compartment A but not in compartment B regions and associated with gene
activity [39]. Given their opposite transcriptional activities, it is intriguing that both
H3K27ac and H3K27me3 markers are enriched at VGI regions (especially in VGI_A
regions). Both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are involved in transcription regulation of genes
responsible for cell differentiation [36]. Whether their enrichment in VGI regions is
mechanistically linked to viral induced transformation remains an interesting open question.
Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that viral-host genome interactions may define unique
chromatin states, which appear to share many features of the open euchromatin but also
show distinct histone marker profile from those associated with activated and repressed
genes.
Relations between viral DNA contacts and DNA replication
Viral DNA replication occurs within defined regions of the host cellâs nucleus [40,41].
Figure 3e shows that compartment A regions, particularly the 148 VGIâs that are part of
compartment A (denoted as VGI_A), are early replicated. Even the 74 VGI regions
classified as being part of the B compartment showed substantially earlier replication
timing compared with other regions in the B compartment, which generally replicate at

later stages (Figure 3e; VGI_B regions showed highest replication signals in the mid S
phase, while compartment B regionsâ signals generally enrich towards the G2 phase.).
These observations suggest that the adenovirus genome prefers to interact with the host
genomeâs early replication regions.
Infection with the dl1500 adenovirus will drive arrested fibroblast cells into S phase [25,21].
To see if the host genome replication driven by dl1500 adenovirus infection spatially colocalizes with positions of viral DNA attachments, we performed BrdU-seq experiments in
24 hours p.i. IMR90 cells following experimental procedures as previously described [42].
IMR90 cells were treated with BrdU at 23.5 hours post dl1500 adenovirus infection. Cells
were harvested 30 min later and BrdU incorporated DNA were immunoprecipitated and
purified for high-throughput sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to both the hg19
and Ad5 reference genomes. Among the uniquely aligned reads, 95% aligned to the Ad5
reference genome, indicating that the majority of DNA replication is from the virus genome
(Figure 4a). The 5% BrdU-seq reads aligned to hg19, a total number of 1,009,498 reads,
were indexed to 500-kb resolution and compared with the VGI contact profiles at 24 hours
pi (Figure 4b). Among the 731 VGI enriched chromatin bins at 24 hours p.i., about 40%
overlapped with BrdU-seq signals. Of the remaining bins without virus-genome
interactions, only ~20% showed host genome replication signals (Figure 4c). However,
since genomic regions with BrdU-seq signal are also much more early replicated than the
other regions (Figure S3; p-value less than 10-16), we cannot determine if host genome
replication at 24 hours p.i. is either due to its intrinsic early replication timing or driven by
viral activities. Based on the BrdU-seq data, we observed that the majority of the DNA
replication activities happened to the virus genome, which is likely the result of high MOI

value of virus infection [21]. Therefore, the fact that more genomic regions are identified
with VGI enrichment in 24 vs. in 6 hours p.i. (731 vs. 222) could be due to extra viral
genome load at the later time point.
Remodeling of epigenetic features in the VGI enriched host genomic regions
Since small e1a alters global patterns of specific histone modifications in the host genome
[24-26], we compared ChIP-seq data of various histone modifications before and after
adenovirus dl1500 infection. We found that VGI enriched genomic regions undergo
dramatic changes in their epigenetic chromatin features upon viral infection (Figure 4d).
The host lysine acetylase p300 binds to VGI enriched regions after infection. p300 interacts
with the retinoblastoma (RB) proteins, which together with e1a (the p300-e1a-RB complex)
function in repressing selected host genes involved in anti-viral defense [27]. Reduced
fold changes of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 were observed in the VGI enriched genomic
regions after infection (Figure 4d), indicating that VGI regions coincide with locations of
host epigenome remodeling. In addition, the histone modification profile of H3K18ac
before infection is strongly anti-correlated (Pearsonâs correlation coefficient = -0.44) with
the VGI frequencies at early infection (Figure 3d, 4d, S2). Upon viral infection small e1a
causes a substantial (~70%) reduction in cellular levels of H3K18ac and specifically, the
elimination of essentially all H3K18ac ChIP-seq peaks at promoters and intergenic regions
of genes related to fibroblast functions [25,26]. Meanwhile, the small e1a also induces the
appearance of new H3K18ac peaks at promoters of highly induced genes associated with
cell cycle control and at new putative enhancers [26]. It is interesting to see that the viral
genome preferentially interacts with the host genome at positions deprived of H3K18ac at
early stages of infection. And after 24 hours of infection, H3K18ac is enhanced at such

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142604. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

VGI genomic regions in the presence of RB and p300 (Figure 4d, 4e). These observations
suggest that acetylation of H3K18 [25], may be related to the binding of the adenovirus
genome or shows similar preference for chromatin regions associated with viral genome
interactions. Besides H3K18ac, enrichment is also found for H3K9ac in the VGI enriched
genomic regions because of the general colocalization of these two histone acetylation
marks [26,43].
The above observations suggest that virus genome attachments to the host genomic regions
coincide and may even potentially induce epigenetic changes during adenovirus infection.
The mechanisms by which the binding of the virus genome may be related causally or
consequentially to such epigenetic changes are unclear. But our studies show non-random
viral-host genome interactions and raise an interesting question for future studies on the
role of VGI in host epigenome remodeling, host gene expression, viral genome replication
and the underlying mechanisms of oncogenic transformation caused by adenovirus
infection.

Conclusions
In this study, we have analyzed the global physical interactions between the adenovirus
genome and host fibroblast genome using tethered chromosome conformation capture. Our
analyses indicate that virus-host genome interactions occur at specific genomic locations.
By mapping VGIs in the host genome at different stages of adenovirus infection, we find
that the initial pattern of VGI locations is largely maintained throughout the infection
process and at later stage of infection the distribution of VGIs expands to additional host

genomic regions. VGIs preferentially occur in the active chromatin subcompartment in the
host genome, which could potentially facilitate viral gene expression and DNA replication.
While the host genomic regions targeted preferentially by virus interactions share many
epigenetic features of activated genes, they also possess many unique histone markers,
suggesting that virus attachment sites on the host genome constitute a unique class of
chromatin states. Our analyses also suggest that VGI could have substantial impact on the
activities of the host genome. Adenovirus-induced epigenetic remodeling of the host
genome appears to be enhanced in genomic regions enriched with VGIs. Likewise, the
binding of regulatory protein machineries (the p300 and RB complex) is increased at
chromatin regions with enriched VGIs. It is conceivable that VGIs may be facilitating these
changes or that these epigenetic changes facilitate VGIs to achieve a favorable outcome for
the virus. Further experiments with higher resolutions are needed to validate and expand
on these findings, to reveal more detailed structural features of the host chromatin regions
where virus genome preferentially bind, and to elucidate the role of virus genome in
regulating host genome activities.

Methods
Cell culture and TCC experiments.
IMR90 cells were grown under standard culturing conditions (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1X
penicillin/streptomycin, 5% CO2, and 37 Â°C). Once the cultures reached 100% confluency,
they were maintained for another 12 hours to make sure cells were being arrested. Cells
were infected with small e1a adenovirus [26] (MOI=200) in regular media while FBS was

reduced to 2% and maintained at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. Mock infection cells received the
new media with no virus. At each stage of 6/24 hours post-infection (pi) and 6/24 hours
mock-infection (mi), old media was aspirated out and 20 millions cells were treated with
fresh medium (DMEM, 2% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin) and 1% of formaldehyde.
TCC experiments were performed as previously described [15].
Preprocessing TCC sequencing output
Sequencing libraries prepared from TCC experiments have unique features because of a
number of special enzyme treatments. In this section, preprocessing of the raw sequencing
reads prior to alignment is described.
Adjusting for sequencing lariats
TCC experiments use exonuclease III to remove the free DNA endsâ biotin before pulling
down of DNA ligation junctions. This step may produce a significant amount of single
strand DNA, which can potentially form hairpin structures during preparation of the
sequencing library. When performing DNA end repair, 5 prime overhang of hairpin
structure will be filled in, which cause the initial sequence of read 2 to be identical to what
from the read 1 and eventually lead to significant amount of alignment failures. We name
this type of errors as âsequencing lariatsâ which is unique for TCC experiments. To
attenuate the effect of these errors, we run a program to search for identical initial
sequences between read 1 and read 2 and trim the identical sequence from read 2 before
performing the alignment. This trimming step significantly increased the percentage of
alignable reads.
Filtering of ligation junctions

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142604. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Informative sequencing results are the ligation products of different DNA fragments
resulted from restriction enzyme digestion. Depending on the sites of DNA shearing,
sequencing reads may surpass the ligation junctions of certain DNA fragments. These reads
may be unable to align to the genome because of the chimeric ligations. In order to improve
the alignment efficiency, we run a program to scan for HindIII ligation junction (expected
to be âAAGCTAGCTTâ after end filling-in and blunt-end ligation) and allow one base of
mutation or deletion considering restriction enzyme star effect) and removed all bases after
the 3 prime midpoint of the junction. This filtering step also led to bigger portion of
successfully aligned reads.
Raw sequencing reads after the previous two steps of filtering are aligned to hg19 and
Adenovirus 5 reference genome by bowtie-1.0.0 with a maximum of three mismatches
allowed.
Removing non-informative pairs
Two types of sequencing read pairs that do not contain any information about the spatial
organization of the genomes and viral-host genome interactions can be readily identified.
The first type consists of pairs that are a result of PCR amplification of a single DNA
molecule (PCR duplication). These pairs can make a contact appear more frequent when it
has only been amplified more efficiently in the PCR. A group of read pairs that are a result
of PCR duplication align to identical positions on both ends. All but one pair in such groups
were removed from the catalogue.
The second type consists of pairs that originate from DNA molecules that do not include a
ligation junction, yet they bind to the streptavidin-coated beads either non-specifically or

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142604. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

as a result of incomplete exonuclease action in removing terminal biotins. After
sequencing, these molecules result in pairs that align just 300-700 bp apart to opposite
strands of the reference sequence of the genome (the size range depends on the size range
used during gel-extraction). All such pairs were removed from the catalogue of each
dataset.
Splitting test for filtering low coverage bins of TCC observed contact (OC) matrix
and choosing optimal resolution to visualize VGI contact profile
Difference in chromatin accessibility of genomic locations leads to difference in
sequencing depth and coverage, which requires special considerations in most of the
sequencing based genomic analyses [44]. For TCC and Hi-C studies, because of lowcoverage in 2D contact matrices, sequencing depth is one of the key considerations. Values
of low coverage matrix entries wonât converge during iterative normalization [33], which
leads to spurious contact frequencies (Figure S4).
Splitting test for TCC OC matrix
To define matrix bins of low coverage, we performed a âsplitting testâ on the TCC OC
matrix, which will divide the data matrix into two matrices by randomly dividing the
unique read counts per entry bin (with value n) following a binomial distribution (x ~
binom(n, p=0.5)). The pair of matrices will be used to test if contact profiles at the given
bin resolution are reproducible. Several pairs of matrices will be generated by independent
splitting test of the original data. Splitting tests were performed on matrices from all of the
four TCC datasets.

Intrachromosomal contacts are not random and maintain specific patterns in interphase
cells [12,15,45]. Therefore, the Pearsonâs correlation between the corresponding pairs of
intrachromosomal contact profiles in both split matrices should be close to +1 if the bin
size is adequately chosen with respect to the available sequencing coverage. Splitting tests
showed that at 500kb bin resolution, the pair-wise Pearsonâs correlation converges to +1 at
1%~2% percentiles. Bins with correlations in the lower 1%~2% percentiles will be
removed from the matrices.
Splitting test for VGI contact vector
To determine the optimal resolution to present the viral-host genome interactions (VGIs),
we performed the same binomial splitting for the VGI contact vector entries and compared
the pairwise correlations at a series of different resolutions. Each VGI contact vector was
split independently 20 times to test the consistency between the splitting tests. Similar as

than

intrachromosomal interactions. Therefore, pairwise Pearsonâs correlation of VGI splitting
tests do not converge to 1 at any resolutions in either one of the two datasets (6 hours pi
and 24 hours pi). So here we choose a reasonable resolution of 500kb, when the pairwise
correlations are generally high and starting to converge (Figure S1).
Bias correction of TCC datasets
Iterative correction of TCC OC matrix
TCC OC matrices of the four datasets are normalized through the iterative correction (ICE)
method to remove experimental biases [33]. As described in the ICE method, the diagonal
of each OC matrix was removed. Also all intrachromosomal interactions with genomic

dangling ends artifacts between consecutive bins. OC matrix bins with low sequencing

Identification of VGI enriched genomic regions by hypothesis testing
A multinomial null model assumption was used for the VGI contact distribution on
genomic locations with Multk(n, p), for which k is the number of binning windows
(k=5,644), n is the total number of observed VGIs for the 6 hours pi and 24 hours pi
sample, and p is the binning windowsâ probability vector (p1, p2, âŚ, pk), which is
proportional to the OC matrix bias vector generated by the ICE normalization. Bins with
significantly higher number of VGIs than expected by the random null model distribution
were defined as VGI enriched with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 10-4. The
FDR was calculated by applying the same statistics to two randomly generated null
models given different p-value thresholds.

Abstract
Mutations in the Golgi SNARE protein Membrin (encoded by the GOSR2 gene) cause
progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). Membrin is a ubiquitously important protein
mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion, and hence it is unclear how these mutations result
in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here we use a multi-layered strategy to
elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the
pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.
Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in novel
Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME. We also observed axonal trafficking abnormalities in
this model, as well as synaptic malformations, trans-synaptic instability and hyperactive
synaptic transmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle
secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a previously uncharacterized role for Membrin in
synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype
relationships in GOSR2-PME.

Introduction
Secreted, membrane, endo- and lysosomal proteins are deposited into the ER after ribosomal
synthesis. Subsequently, these proteins exit the ER, transition through the Golgi apparatus and
reach their ultimate target sites via the trans-Golgi network – a biosynthetic route termed the
secretory pathway (Palade, 1975). The transport of proteins along this path is facilitated by
membrane-enclosed vesicles, and their fusion event at the cis-Golgi is mediated by the target
(t-) SNARE proteins Membrin (also known as GS27; encoded by the GOSR2 gene), Sec22b
and Syntaxin-5, in concert with the vesicle (v-) SNARE Bet1 (Parlati et al., 2000; Xu et al.,
2000). Similarly to other intracellular fusion steps, these proteins are necessary for fusion of
opposing lipid bilayers through the formation of a quaternary SNARE complex (Hay et al.,
1997; Lowe et al., 1997; Parlati et al., 2002; Volchuk et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2000). Critical to
this process is the N- to C-terminal zippering along 15 mostly hydrophobic ‘layer’ amino
acids (-7 to +8) within the SNARE domain of each protein (Antonin et al., 2002; Sutton et al.,
1998; Zwilling et al., 2007).
Homozygous missense (G144W: layer -3) or compound heterozygous missense and deletion
mutations (G144W & K164del: between layer +2 and +3) in Membrin’s SNARE motif have
recently been shown to cause the severe neurological syndrome progressive myoclonus
epilepsy (PME) (Corbett et al., 2011; Praschberger et al., 2015). Patients with this form of
PME, termed GOSR2-PME, typically present with ataxia around age three, followed by
cortical myoclonus and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Despite rapid disease progression
and frequent premature death, cognitive function usually remains remarkably preserved.
Correspondingly, marked neurodegeneration as an underlying primary cause has not been
reported (Boissé Lomax et al., 2013; Corbett et al., 2011; Praschberger et al., 2015; van
Egmond et al., 2015; 2014). Given the critical role of Membrin in ER-to-Golgi trafficking and
its fundamental importance in every cell of the human body, it is unclear why Membrin
mutations specifically result in nervous system dysfunction and do not cause symptoms in
other organs. No paralogue is present in the human genome that could functionally replace
Membrin in non-neuronal cells and therefore explain the primarily neuronal phenotype.
In the present study we set out to unravel the neuronal bottle-neck of GOSR2-PME. To do so,
we investigated the disease mechanism of GOSR2-PME from molecule to neuron utilizing
reconstituted liposome fusion assays, patient-derived fibroblasts and Drosophila models. We
found that the pathogenic Membrin SNARE motif mutations result in a partial loss-of3

function that is nonetheless sufficient to robustly reduce dendritic growth in vivo. Membrin
mutations also resulted in pre-synaptic retraction and physiological abnormalities at motor
neuron synapses. Together, our results suggest a mechanistic basis for the multifaceted
neurological features of GOSR2-PME patients; highlight tight trafficking demands of growing
dendrites; and illustrate a close-knit dependence of synaptic integrity and neurotransmitter
release on cargo trafficking through the Golgi apparatus.

Results
GOSR2-PME mutations result in partial SNARE dysfunction
The locations of the PME-causing G144W and K164del mutations in Membrin’s SNARE
domain suggests defective assembly of the quaternary cis-Golgi SNARE complex, likely
resulting in reduced fusion of vesicular cargo carriers with this compartment. Given the
technical difficulties associated with producing mammalian Golgi SNAREs and since
mammalian and yeast Golgi SNAREs are functionally conserved (Varlamov et al., 2004), we
tested for SNARE defects using a well-established yeast SNARE protein liposome fusion
assay (McNew et al., 2000; Parlati et al., 2002). In this assay, v-SNARE containing liposomes
are loaded with the fluorophores Nitro-2-1,3 benzoxadiazol-4yl-phosphatidylethanolamine
(NBD-PE) and Rhodamine-PE. Both fluorophores are lipid-bound and exhibit robust Förster
resonance energy transfer. Thus, NBD fluorescence is quenched in the presence of
Rhodamine. When v-SNARE liposomes fuse with unlabeled t-SNARE-containing liposomes,
NBD and rhodamine molecules become spatially separated, NBD is dequenched and NBD
fluorescence increases, providing a measure of liposome fusion (Struck et al., 1981).
We introduced the corresponding PME linked G176W/D196del mutations into the Membrin
yeast ortholog Bos1 (Figure 1A). Subsequently, we purified wild type (WT) and mutant Bos1
along with the SNARE partners Bet1, Sec22 and Sed5 (orthologous to mammalian Syntaxin5) in Escherichia coli. Purified t-SNAREs Bos1, Sec22 and Sed5 were preassembled and
reconstituted into acceptor liposomes and the v-SNARE Bet1 was incorporated into the
fluorescent donor liposomes (Figure 1B). Both PME mutations resulted in a reduced rate and
extent of fusion compared to WT (Figure 1C, D). However, these rates were significantly
higher relative to a negative control where the Bos1-Sed5-Sec22 t-SNARE complex was
omitted (Figure 1C, D). This finding implies that both GOSR2-PME mutations cause only a
partial and not complete loss of function. The magnitude of these effects is consistent with the

position and nature of each mutation within the SNARE motif. The D196del deletion likely
results in misalignment of the subsequent hydrophobic layers in the C-terminal half of the
SNARE domain, a region that provides the critical force to drive membrane fusion (Zhang,
2017). Correspondingly, this mutation reduced total fusion (after 120 min) by ~ 60% (Figure
1C, D). The G176W mutation also resulted in fusion impairment, but to a lesser degree than
D196del (~ 30%; Figure 1C, D). This is consistent with an alteration in the N-terminal
SNARE region that mediates the initial engagement of SNARE domains bridging two
opposing lipid bilayers. Indeed, in accordance with a selective N-terminal assembly defect,
the effects of G176W but not D196del were rescued by addition of a peptide comprising of
the C-terminal half of the Bet1 SNARE domain, which acts to pre-structure the N-terminus
(Figure 1E, F) (Melia et al., 2002). Increasing the pool of preassembled trans-SNARE
complexes by overnight pre-incubation at 4°C also restored the fusion capacity of G176W-,
but not D196del-Bos1 containing liposomes (Figure S1B, C), further demonstrating that the
G176W and D196del mutations affect distinct regions of the Membrin SNARE domain.
Taken together, these results suggest that the orthologous G144W and K164del mutations in
Membrin partially impair distinct steps of the cis-Golgi SNARE complex formation, which is
necessary for fusion of vesicular cargo-carriers with the cis-Golgi (Hay et al., 1997; 1998).
Mutant Membrin retains the capability to localize to the cis-Golgi
Only Membrin localized to the cis-Golgi will be capable of mediating deposition of ERderived cargo into this compartment. Thus we assessed the subcellular localization of
overexpressed WT and G144W/K164del mutant FLAG::Membrin in primary skin fibroblasts
derived from a healthy human control. Similar to WT, both mutants successfully exited the
ER and co-localized with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GPP130 (Figure S2A, B and Figure
2A, B). Previously, it was reported that G144W mutant Membrin failed to localize to the cisGolgi in a patient derived fibroblast line (Corbett et al., 2011). We therefore re-examined
these cells with an experimentally validated anti-Membrin antibody (Figure S2C, D).
Membrin could clearly be detected at the cis-Golgi of G144W mutant fibroblasts and did not
appear to accumulate in the ER, confirming the above overexpression results in patient cells
(Figure 2C, D and Figure S2E). We note that both Golgi-localized and overall Membrin
levels were reduced in the single GOSR2-PME patient cell line (Figure S2F-H). However,
there was also substantial variability in Membrin levels between healthy control lines (Figure
S2F-H). Thus, from the above data we conclude that both the G144W and K164del mutant
forms of Membrin retain the intrinsic capability to localize to their cis-Golgi target

compartment. This suggests that the partial SNARE domain deficiencies found in liposome
fusion assays are relevant to lipid bilayer fusion rates at the cis-Golgi in living cells.
Early lethality and locomotor defects in Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME
We next sought to study the effect of Membrin mutations in vivo to assess their impact upon
the nervous system. Golgi SNARE proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution
(Kienle et al., 2009; Kloepper et al., 2007), and the Drosophila genome contains a single
ortholog of the Membrin encoding GOSR2 gene. In flies this gene is designated membrin,
encoding the protein Membrin. Consistent with an essential role for Membrin orthologs in
eukaryotes (Shim et al., 1991), homozygosity for the membrin null allele membrin1524 resulted
in lethality largely prior to the L2 larval stage (Figure 3A, B) (Ghabrial et al., 2011).
To assess the pathogenic GOSR2-PME mutations in Drosophila, we initially generated
transgenic fly lines harboring FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant (G144W or K164del) UASGOSR2 transgenes. Each transgene sequence was integrated at the same genomic locus using
site-specific ΦC31-mediated recombination in order to control for position effects on
expression levels (Figure S3A) (Bischof et al., 2007). These transgenes, downstream of the
yeast upstream activating sequence (UAS), are inert and only transcribed in the presence of
the Gal4 transcriptional activator expressed via a promoter of choice (Brand and Perrimon,
1993). To enable global expression of wild-type or mutant GOSR2 in a membrin null
background we used the global daughterless-Gal4 driver. Each genetic component of these
models was outcrossed into an isogenic iso31 background for five generations to limit genetic
variability between strains. Indeed, expression of wild-type human GOSR2 fully rescued the
lethality of membrin null larvae and yielded adults that appeared morphologically grossly
normal (Figure S3B, C). While these animals exhibited severe motor impairments and usually
died after three days, this result nonetheless demonstrates functional conservation between
human and Drosophila Membrin, supporting the use of Drosophila to model GOSR2-PME.
Because neither mutant GOSR2 transgene rescued membrin1524 animals to the L3 larval stage
(data not shown), we next generated GOSR2-PME models that were closer to the normal
physiology of Drosophila. According to the identical strategy as for the human UAS-GOSR2
transgenes, we created mutant (G147W and K166del) and wild-type Drosophila UASmembrin transgenes in order to be able to express wild-type or mutant membrin in a membrin
null genetic background. For simplicity, we term these mutant fly lines and their associated
control Mem-G147W, Mem-K166del and Mem-WT (Figure 3A).

In contrast to membrin null flies, Mem-WT flies were viable to the adult stage, indicating that
transgenic FLAG-tagged Drosophila Membrin is functional (Figure 3C, D). Mem-G147W
and Mem-K166del flies were viable to the pupal stage, surviving significantly longer than
membrin null animals (Figure 3C). However, Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del flies
frequently died within the pupal cases as fully developed pharate adults (Figure 3D). When
manually released from the pupal case, Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del adults appeared
weak and uncoordinated. Mutant animals that successfully freed themselves from their pupal
cases usually became stuck in the fly food soon after eclosion and died within a few days.
Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del L3 larvae also displayed significantly reduced rates of
locomotion compared to Mem-WT (Figure 3E). Similar locomotor deficits and lack of
coordination may explain the frequently observed inability of Mem-G147W and MemK166del flies to escape from the pupal case, leading to early lethality. Thus, although both
mutants survived longer than membrin null flies, the incomplete nature of this rescue provides
in vivo evidence that these mutations cause partial – not complete – loss of Membrin
function, consistent with the above liposome fusion assays (Figure 1).
Profound dendritic growth deficits in GOSR2-PME model neurons
The early-onset of neurological symptoms in GOSR2-PME suggests that Membrin mutations
might alter aspects of neuronal development. Important clues towards the underlying
mechanism stem from studies investigating neuronal consequences of mutations in other ERto-Golgi trafficking proteins. Overexpression of GTP locked Q71L-Arf1 in developing
cultured hippocampal neurons led to severely impaired dendritic growth (Horton et al., 2005).
Similarly, Ye et al. found in a Drosophila forward genetic screen that mutations in Sec23,
Sar1 and Rab1 cause dendritic growth deficiencies (Ye et al., 2007). Such early secretory
pathway blocks likely prevent ER-derived lipids and proteins from reaching the plasmalemma
of growing neurons, which place immense demands on such supplies due to their very large
surface area (Hanus and Ehlers, 2008).
However, whereas Q71L-Arf1 and truncated Sar1 result in a complete block of anterograde
trafficking (Dascher and Balch, 1994; Horton et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2007), the above
liposome fusion assays and Drosophila GOSR2-PME models indicate that PME-causing
mutations in Membrin are partial loss-of-function (Figure 1 and 3). Thus, we sought to test
whether even a partial decrease in ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion was sufficient to impair
dendritic growth. To do so, we genetically labeled ddaC sensory neurons within the larval
body-wall with a membrane-tagged – and thus secretory pathway dependent – fluorophore

(CD4::tdGFP) under control of the ppk promoter (Grueber et al., 2003; Han et al., 2011).
These neurons have highly sophisticated, tiled dendritic arbors that branch in 2D and they are
unambiguously polarized into a single axon and multiple dendrites (Figure 4A, arrow-head
indicates the axon). Using this approach, we imaged the same identifiable ddaC neuron in
abdominal segment 5 of Mem-WT, Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del L3 larvae (Figure 4A).
Strikingly, both Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del larvae exhibited profoundly decreased
dendritic length and a reduction in the number of terminal dendritic branches relative to MemWT (Figures 4B, C). Sholl analysis further revealed reduced elaboration of dendritic arbors
and a significant reduction in total dendritic intersections in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del
(Figure 4D, E). Using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP), we tested whether
trafficking of the CD4::tdGFP cargo was altered in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del
dendrites. Mem-K166del larvae exhibited a clear reduction in CD4::tdGFP FRAP, and a
similar albeit non-significant trend was seen for Mem-G147W (Figure 4F). Thus, dendritic
growth and cargo trafficking within dendrites are impacted to a greater degree in MemK166del than Mem-G147W, again consistent with a more severe SNARE defect of the
orthologous D196del Bos1 mutation in liposome fusion assays (Figure 1).
Reduced cargo trafficking in Membrin mutant axons
While both growing dendrites and axons require abundant membrane addition and thus rely
heavily upon secretory trafficking (Aridor and Fish, 2009), Ye et al. suggested that axonal
growth can be privileged in the face of ER-to-Golgi trafficking deficits (Ye et al., 2007). We
examined this notion in our GOSR2-PME Drosophila model and were able to detect axonal
CD4::tdGFP signal in each ventral nerve cord (VNC) segmental nerve (Figure 5A; for
saturated images see Figure S4A). This finding suggests that at least one axon derived from
the three ppk-positive neurons per hemisegment (designated ddaC, v’ada and vdaB) reached
its comparably distant target (Grueber et al., 2003; 2002; 2007). Compared with the reduced
elaboration of ddaC dendrites (Figure 4), this is consistent with dendritic growth being more
severely impaired than axonal growth by GOSR2-PME mutations. Nevertheless, axonal and
pre-synaptic CD4::tdGFP levels were significantly reduced both in the VNC and in individual
segmental nerves of both Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del at steady state (Figure 5A-C).
Thus, a secretory pathway deficit is clearly present in distal axons of membrin mutant
Drosophila. We used the large and experimentally accessible neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
of L3 larvae as a model synapse to test whether the deficit in trafficking seen with
CD4::tdGFP in ppk neurons was also reflected by changes of endogenous synaptic cargos

(Harris and Littleton, 2015). Amongst several tested pre-, post- and trans-synaptic proteins,
we found robust reductions in the steady state levels of the synaptic vesicle protein Cysteine
String Protein (CSP), while the other cargos exhibited no consistent change compared to
Mem-WT (Figure S4B-H). These results provide proof-of-principle that Membrin mutations
can affect the abundance of endogenous synaptic proteins. The different effects upon
individual synaptic components at steady state may reflect varying trafficking demands of
synaptic proteins due to differences in synaptic turnover.
Unimpaired secretory trafficking in G144W Membrin mutant fibroblasts
GOSR2-PME patients exhibit a restrictive neurological phenotype despite the ubiquitous
expression of Membrin. We wondered whether the neuronal secretory pathway deficit
observed in GOSR2-PME model axons might be the consequence of the unique geometry of
neurons, and thus not be applicable to a non-neuronal cell. To address the possibility that the
partial loss of function Membrin mutations might not be functionally relevant in a nonneuronal cell type with lower trafficking demands, we performed Golgi trafficking assays in
primary skin fibroblasts from a G144W GOSR2-PME patient and healthy controls by
overexpressing human growth hormone (hGH) fused to four FM domains and a Halo-tag. The
FM domains self-aggregate in the absence of a solubilizing drug and thus do not allow ER
exit of this model cargo (Figure S5A 1st column). Conversely, addition of D/D solubilizer
disaggregates the FM domains and allows the cargo to enter the secretory pathway. By 10
minutes after solubilization we detected significant colocalization with the cis-Golgi marker
GM130, which decreased by 20 and 30 min as the cargo exited this compartment (Figure
S5A, B). Remarkably, trafficking kinetics in G144W mutant Membrin fibroblasts were
almost indistinguishable from controls (Figure S5A, B). This finding supports the concept
that cellular effects of the partial loss of function G144W Membrin mutation are unmasked
only under large secretory pathway requirements, suggesting why only the nervous system
with its high trafficking demands is symptomatically affected in GOSR2-PME.
Presynaptic morphological defects in GOSR2-PME model neurons
Because we could detect secretory pathway defects in distal axons and synapses of GOSR2PME Drosophila models (Figure 5A-C), we next investigated whether synaptic integrity
might be altered due to the GOSR2-PME mutations. To this end we examined presynaptic
morphology at the L3 larval NMJ by labeling neuronal membranes with an anti-horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) antibody, which stains neurons due to cross-reactivity with certain glycans
on their surfaces (Fabini et al., 2001). These motor neuron termini are composed of an array

of rounded synaptic boutons housing active zone domains responsible for coupling calcium
influx to neurotransmitter release (Harris and Littleton, 2015). Motor neurons of Mem-WT,
Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del all successfully formed synapses, and Mem-G147W and
Mem-K166del synapses did not exhibit significant reductions in bouton number nor size
relative to Mem-WT (Figure 5D, E and Figure S6A-C). However, we observed two clear
morphological abnormalities in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del synapses. Firstly, MemG147W and Mem-K166del terminal synaptic boutons often exhibited elongated axonal
protrusions lacking rounded boutons, that were less common and shorter in Mem-WT (Figure
5D, F and Figure S6C, D). Secondly, we observed small boutons in Mem-G147W and MemK166del synapses that were disconnected from the main axonal branch (Figure 5D
arrowheads). In addition, analysis of axonal diameter revealed a significant increase in the
variability of the maximal axonal diameter (Figure 5G), as measured by the coefficient of
variation (Figure 5H) and F-test (Mem-G147W vs. Mem-WT, p = 0.0035; Mem-K166del vs.
Mem-WT, p = 0.0002). Thus, partial reductions in secretory pathway trafficking result in
multifaceted abnormalities in motor neuron synapse development and impact the stereotypy
of terminal axon morphology.
Membrin mutations result in synaptic retraction and cytoskeletal fragmentation
To examine potential effects of Membrin mutations on synaptic structure in more detail, we
co-stained Mem-WT, Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del synapses with antibodies against the
presynaptic active zone marker Bruchpilot (BRP) and postsynaptic GLURIII glutamate
receptors (Figure 6A). BRP localized to Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del NMJs in amounts
comparable to Mem-WT (Figure 6B). However, dual pre- and postsynaptic labeling revealed
pronounced strings of small presynaptic boutons in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del
synapses in which presynaptic BRP was no longer opposed to postsynaptic GLURIII (Figure
6A, C). This disruption of trans-synaptic organization is indicative of pre-synaptic retraction,
where synaptic connections initially form but fail to be maintained throughout development
(Eaton et al., 2002; Pielage et al., 2008).
Synaptic retraction can be induced by mutations in several cytoskeletal proteins (Koch et al.,
2008; Pielage et al., 2008; 2011; 2005). Long protrusions lacking specialized boutons and
alterations in axonal diameter in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del synapses further suggested
potential cytoskeletal defects in these backgrounds (Pielage et al., 2011; Stephan et al., 2015).
To uncover molecular correlates of synaptic retraction in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del,
we therefore examined the localization of two presynaptic cytoskeleton associated proteins:

Futsch (a microtubule-binding protein) and Ankyrin-2XL (ANK2-XL) (Koch et al., 2008;
Roos et al., 2000). In Mem-WT synapses, both Futsch and ANK2-XL were strongly colocalized in central and distal axons and invade terminal boutons (Figure 6D) (Stephan et al.,
2015). Strikingly, in both terminal boutons and elongated protrusions of Mem-G147W and
Mem-K166del synapses, we observed either fragmentation of the normally continuous
Futsch- and ANK2-XL-labeled cytoskeleton, or an absence of one or both proteins (Figure
6D). Thus, secretory defects due to Membrin mutations reduce the local integrity of the
presynaptic cytoskeleton.
Physiological abnormalities at Membrin mutant synapses
Finally, given the profound synaptic morphological abnormalities at Membrin mutant NMJs
and cortical myoclonus and generalized epilepsy in GOSR2-PME patients, we asked whether
Membrin mutations altered spontaneous or evoked neurotransmitter release at the L3 larval
NMJ. We detected a clear reduction in the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory
post-synaptic potentials (mEPSPs) in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del (Figure 7A, B), while
the amplitude and time course of mEPSPs were comparable between wild-type and the
Membrin mutants (Figure S7A, B). No effect of Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del mutations
on the amplitude of single postsynaptic evoked EPSPs was observed (Figure S7C). However,
we often observed grossly deformed trains of EPSPs in both Mem-G147W and MemK166del following 5 consecutive stimuli at 10 Hz, where between one and all five EPSPs
exhibited broader waveforms with multiple peaks and occasional merging of EPSPs (Figure
7C). Significantly more EPSP trains were abnormal in both mutants compared to Mem-WT:
5% of EPSP trains in Mem-WT were scored abnormal by a blinded observer, compared to ~
25% in Mem-G147W and 22% in Mem-K166del (Figure 7D). In addition, the area under the
EPSP train was robustly increased in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del compared to MemWT (Figure 7E). These findings indicate that the morphological abnormalities caused by
pathogenic GOSR2 mutations are also associated with altered synaptic function.

Discussion
To date, how mutations in Membrin - a ubiquitous and essential Golgi SNARE protein manifest as a disorder restricted to the nervous system has been unclear. Here we demonstrate
that PME-causing Membrin mutations partially reduce SNARE activity yet still result in
profound dendritic growth deficits in Drosophila models. Furthermore, we identify signatures
of synaptic disassembly and altered neurotransmission, establishing a close dependence of
synaptic stability and physiology upon precisely tuned secretory trafficking.
In Drosophila, the orthologous G147W and K166del Membrin mutations reduce
dendritogenesis with a relative severity consistent with the corresponding effects on Bos1dependent liposome fusion in vitro. Our findings reinforce the results of a Drosophila screen
that identified the ER-to-Golgi trafficking proteins Sar1, Sec23 and Rab1 to be required for
dendrite growth (Ye et al., 2007). Because our results are based on the study of a human
Mendelian disorder, they provide an instance that highlights the importance of this pathway
for human neuronal physiology and disease (Jan and Jan, 2010). Interestingly, mutations in
Sec23A, Sec23A, Sec24D and Sar1b present in humans with largely non-neuronal clinical
phenotypes of cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, a
syndromic form of osteogenesis imperfecta and lipid absorption disorders (Annesi et al.,
2007; Bianchi et al., 2009; Boyadjiev et al., 2006; Garbes et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2003;
Schwarz et al., 2009). This appears to be a consequence of tissue-specific differential
utilization of the two available isoforms of Sec23 and Sar1 and special demands upon the
COPII coat due to the large size of procollagen and chylomicrons (Canty and Kadler, 2005;
Fromme et al., 2008; 2007; Jones et al., 2003).
We found that even subtle defects in the secretory pathway – such as observed in G176W
Bos1/G144W Membrin – can be highly relevant for neuronal growth, while not critically
affecting ER-to-Golgi trafficking in a non-neuronal cell type such as a fibroblast. We thereby
provide experimental evidence for the postulate that, due to the unique plasma membrane
demands of a growing neuron, even minor disruptions along the secretory pathway can
selectively disrupt the nervous system while falling below a critical threshold in other organs
(Pfenninger, 2009). We posit that this is the likeliest explanation of why GOSR2-PME is a
syndrome restricted to the nervous system. Furthermore, the observed dendritic growth
deficits might directly explain one hallmark of this disorder – lack of coordination. A
dendritic growth bottleneck will presumably affect most severely neurons with highly

elaborate dendritic arbors, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells (Ramón y Cajal, 1906).
Impairment of these cells in turn would give rise to ataxia, as they are of critical importance
for motor coordination (Cerminara et al., 2015; Kasumu and Bezprozvanny, 2010).
Interestingly, cerebellar defects have even been suggested to also be involved in the
pathogenesis of cortical myoclonus (Ganos et al., 2014).
Our study extends the findings of Ye et al. by showing that early secretory pathway changes
can significantly impact synaptic morphology and physiology as well as dendritogenesis (Ye
et al., 2007). We found that larval NMJs of Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del exhibit synaptic
retraction, abnormal elongated protrusions lacking synaptic specializations, reduced
spontaneous neurotransmitter release and malformed EPSPs. Interestingly, EMG evidence of
motoneuron denervation in GOSR2-PME patients has been reported, and the typical absence
of deep-tendon reflexes in this disorder might also be a consequence of such changes (van
Egmond et al., 2014).
Membrin acts as a gatekeeper at the cis-Golgi and thereby likely determines the transition
speeds for a plethora of synaptic and axonal proteins. Thus, the observed synaptic changes
likely arise from a complex interaction of trafficking delays or steady-state reductions of
many different proteins. Nevertheless, we identify several molecular correlates of the above
structural changes. These include the loss or fragmentation of the cytoskeletal proteins
ANK2-XL (an Ankyrin-2 isoform) and Futsch, particularly in presynaptic boutons with
elongated protrusions. The axonal and synaptic cytoskeleton contains several interlinked
constituents, including a microtubule core; actin filaments; and a submembranous mesh of
Ankyrin and Spectrin (Goellner and Aberle, 2012). Collectively, these components regulate
an array of key neurodevelopmental and physiological parameters including synaptic growth,
morphology, and stability; axonal caliber; and ion channel localization (Chung et al., 2006;
Jenkins and Bennett, 2001; Koch et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2006; Pielage et al., 2005; 2008;
2011; Roos et al., 2000; Stephan et al., 2015). Futsch is the Drosophila homologue of the
mammalian microtubule-binding protein MAP1B (Roos et al., 2000), and the absence or
fragmentation of Futsch in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del synapses implies similar
alterations in microtubule stability. Given the synaptic retraction observed in Mem-G147W
and Mem-K166del NMJs, it is interesting to note that destabilization of microtubules is an
early event during naturally occurring synapse loss at the mammalian NMJ (Bishop et al.,
2004; Brill et al., 2016). Ankyrin-2 isoforms act to delineate Drosophila synaptic termini into
characteristic rounded boutons separated by thin inter-bouton domains (Koch et al., 2008;
13

Kurshan et al., 2009; Pielage et al., 2008). Since Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del boutons
often exhibit elongated protrusions reminiscent of extended inter-bouton domains, we
speculate a direct link between local destabilization of the synaptic cytoskeleton, synaptic
retraction and the presence of elongated protrusions in Mem-G147W and Mem-K166del
synapses.
Membrin mutations not only affect synaptic structure but also disrupt evoked and
spontaneous neurotransmitter release. We can only speculate about the underlying
mechanisms, which are likely to again represent a complex, cumulative process caused by
insufficient trafficking of diverse cargos such as ion channels and proteins required for
presynaptic vesicle fusion. Increased variability of axonal diameters in Mem-G147W and
Mem-K166del may further alter action potential propagation velocities across different axons
innervating the same muscle, leading to de-synchronized depolarizing currents.
The progressive myoclonus epilepsies are phenotypically heterogeneous, with several
different causative genes known to date (Michelucci et al., 2012). Some of the PMEs with
more closely related phenotypes might share cellular pathways and/or neural circuits with
GOSR2-PME. For instance, mutations in PRICKLE1 cause PME in humans and seizures in
flies (Bassuk et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2011), and PRICKLE1 has been linked to neurite growth
and axonal trafficking (Ehaideb et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). PME-linked mutations in the
potassium channel gene KCNC1 are thought to mainly impair fast-spiking neurons (Muona et
al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2017). Such a preferential defect in high-frequency firing neurons is
also conceivable in GOSR2-PME, where EPSP dys-morphologies are more pronounced under
repetitive stimulation.
In summary, by elucidating the pathophysiology of GOSR2-PME we identify a critical role
for Membrin in promoting synaptic integrity, highlight stringent requirements of dendritic
growth on the secretory pathway, and define how mutations in an essential gene can
selectively disrupt nervous system function.

Materials and Methods
Molecular biology
Human GOSR2 CDS as well as Drosophila melanogaster membrin CDS with and without the
G144W/G147W and K164del/K166del mutations preceded by 5’ FLAG tag coding sequence
were custom synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently cloned via
NotI and KpnI (NEB) into pUASTattB, giving rise to
pUASTattB_FLAG::GOSR2[WT]/pUASTattB_FLAG::membrin[WT],
pUASTattB_FLAG::GOSR2[G144W]/pUASTattB_FLAG::membrin[G147W] and
pUASTattB_FLAG::GOSR2[K164del]/pUASTattB_FLAG::membrin[K166del]. The GOSR2
constructs were also cloned into of pcDNA3.1(-) by replacing the CDS of pcDNA3.1(-)
mouse C/EBP beta (LAP) (Addgene plasmid #12557) for these inserts via NotI and KpnI
(NEB), giving rise to pcDNA3.1(-)_GOSR2[WT], pcDNA3.1(-)_GOSR2 [G144W] and
pcDNA3.1(-)_GOSR2[K164del]. pGEX-2T-GST::Sed5, pET28a-His::Sec22, pET28aHis::Bet1 and pET28a-His::Bos1[WT] were previously described (Parlati et al., 2000; 2002).
To generate pET28a-His::Bos1[G176W] and pET28a-His::Bos1[D196del], the respective
mutations were introduced with the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent
Technology). The Halo::FM4::hGH containing plasmid was previously cloned in the
Rothman lab (Lavieu et al., 2013).
Bioinformatics
SNARE motifs in human and Drosophila Membrin, as well as yeast Bos1, were identified as
described previously (Kloepper et al., 2007) and aligned with Clustal Omega (McWilliam et
al., 2013). Conserved residues were highlighted using BoxShade.
Liposome fusion assays
The recombinant yeast Golgi SNARE proteins were expressed and purified in E. coli BL21
(DE3) cells as described previously (Parlati et al., 2000). GST-Sed5 was purified using
glutathione agarose affinity beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the GST-tag was removed
using 100U of human thrombin (Sigma) with overnight incubation at 4°C in Buffer A (25
mM HEPES pH7.4, 400 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1% n-Octyl-β-Dglucopyranoside) containing 2 mM CaCl2. The other proteins – Sec22, Bet1, wild-type and
G176W/D196del mutant Bos1 – were purified with a His6-tag using HisPur Ni-NTA affinity

Purified SNARE proteins were reconstituted into lipid vesicles using the detergent (1% nOctyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) dilution and dialysis method (Weber et al., 1998). For the tSNARE acceptor liposomes, 27 µM of Sed5, Sec22 and wild-type or G176W/D196del
mutant Bos1 in 500 µl were incubated overnight at 4°C and then incorporated into palmitoyl2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC): 1,2 dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS) at 85:15
mol% liposomes. The donor liposomes containing Bet1 (1:100 protein:lipid ratio) were
prepared similarly with the lipid mix of POPC, DOPS and the fluorescent probes Nitro-2-1,3
benzoxadiazol-4yl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and Rhodamine-PE (1.5 mol%
each). All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids (Alabaster, AL). Liposome fusion
assay was performed by mixing 5 µl of the donor liposome (Bet1) with 45 µl of the acceptor
liposome (t-SNAREs). Fusion of liposomes was monitored by the change in NBD
fluorescence at 538 nm using a Flexstation 3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). After
120 min, 10 µl of 5% w/v n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to
lyse all vesicles to estimate the maximum NBD fluorescence (Weber et al., 1998). For
experiments with the Bet1 peptide, the t-SNARE liposomes were pre-incubated at 37°C for
45 min with 50 µM peptide corresponding to the C-terminal half of Bet1
(RGSNQTIDQLGDTFHNTSVKLKRTFGNMMEMA, Vc peptide) prior to addition of Bet1
liposomes to initiate fusion.
Cell culture and transfections
Primary skin derived fibroblasts from the first described GOSR2-PME patient were kindly
shared by Mark Corbett (Corbett et al., 2011). As controls, we used fibroblasts from healthy
individuals of either the same sex and similar age, or opposing sex and divergent age (control
1 = 23 year old female; control 2 = 60 year old male at time of biopsy). Fibroblast and
HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fibroblast
transfections were carried out with lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), HEK293T
transfections with Effectene (Qiagen).
Fibroblast imaging
For immuno-fluorescence studies cells were seeded on #1.5 glass coverslips, fixed with 4%
PFA and permeabilized in PBS containing Triton-X100 and NP40. After primary and
secondary antibody incubation steps coverslips were mounted in SlowFade Gold Antifade
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Membrin (clone
25, BD Biosciences; This antibody was raised against Membrin residues 5-124 and therefore

anti-FLAG (Agilent), rabbit anti-GPP130 (Cambridge Bioscience), rabbit anti-PDI (Sigma),
and goat anti-mouse/rabbit/rat Alexa Fluor 488/555/647 conjugated secondaries (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). For Golgi trafficking studies cells were loaded with HaloTag TMR Ligand
(Promega) 24 h post transfection with Halo::FM4::hGH. Subsequently ER retained cargo was
realeased by addition of D/D solubilizer 1.5 µM (Clontech). Fixed samples were imaged with
a Plan-Apochromat 63x 1.4 NA oil immersion objective on Zeiss confocal LSM710 or
LSM880 microscopes.
Western blot
Cells or whole L3 larvae were lysed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 10
mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors
(PhosSTOP/cOmplete, Roche). Total protein content was quantified with the Pierce 660 nm
assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts loaded into each lane. Proteins were
separated on a 4-10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred
onto PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). The following antibodies were used: mouse antiMembrin (clone 25, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-β-actin (clone AC-74, Sigma) and HRPconjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno). For semi-quantitative western blots, detection was
carried out with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and a ChemiDocTM Imaging system (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were extracted
with Image Studio Lite (Li-cor).
Drosophila stocks
membrin1524 flies were previously generated in an EMS screen and kindly shared by Mark
Krasnow (Ghabrial et al., 2011). This strain harbors a premature stop codon upstream of the
membrin SNARE domain encoding sequence and therefore represents a null-allele. To control
for potential genetic background effects we outcrossed membrin1524 for five generations into
an isogenic iso31 background by following an AccI (NEB) restriction site that is introduced
by the nonsense mutation. GOSR2 and membrin transgenic flies were generated by
microinjection of
pUASTattB_FLAG::GOSR2[WT/G144W/K164del]/pUASTattB_FLAG::membrin[WT/G147
W/K166del] into y[1] M{vas-int.Dm}ZH-2A w*; M{3xP3-RFP.attP'}ZH-51C embryos
(Cambridge fly facility). This approach enabled us to retrieve wild-type and mutant membrin
transgenic fly lines with insertions into precisely the same genomic locus (ZH-51C), which is

important to provide comparable transgene expression levels (Bischof et al., 2007). In order
to express wild-type or mutant GOSR2 or membrin in a membrin null background the
following stocks were created and crossed to each other: I. w[1118]; UASFLAG::GOSR2[WT/G144W/K164del]; membrin1524/TM6B, tb or w[1118]; UASFLAG::membrin[WT/G147W/K166del]; membrin1524/TM6B, tb and II. w[1118]; +;
membrin1524, daughterless-GAL4/TM6B, tb. Each component of these flies was outcrossed
for five generations into iso31 prior to assembly by standard mating schemes. For dendritic
analysis, ppk-CD4::tdGFP (Han et al., 2011) was incorporated into stock II. (w[1118]; ppkCD4::tdGFP; membrin1524, daughterless-Gal4/TM6B, tb) and crossed to stock I.
daughterless-Gal4 was obtained from Bloomington stock center. Flies were reared on a
standard cornmeal-molasses-yeast medium at 25°C in 12 h light-dark cycle.
Drosophila viability and locomotion
To assess viability of membrin mutant animals, the above I x II crosses were allowed to egglay onto apple-juice agar plates overnight. Subsequently, eggs/embryos were counted and
transferred to standard food tubes. After completion of pupation, non-tubby pupae were
counted. Given that theoretically only one quarter of the collected egg/embryos are of the
correct genotype, we used the following formula to calculate egg/embryo to pupa viability:
non-tubby pupae/(total eggs/4). The resulting fraction was normalized to wild-type because
we found a considerable reduction with consecutive egg-lays, presumably reflecting
decreasing fertilization. Eclosion rates were determined 11 days after onset of egg laying, a
time point where under our conditions non-eclosion was equal to death or imminent death in
the pupal case. To assess locomotion, L3 larvae were placed in the center of a 100 mm
sucrose-agar plate positioned on top of a 4 mm grid, allowed to settle for 30 s, and filmed for
the next 60 s. Grid-breaks in this time period were then assessed offline.
Dendritic analysis
The highly elaborate ddaC neuron in abdominal segment 5 of L3 larvae was used throughout
(Grueber et al., 2002). For morphological analysis, larvae were heat-killed and mounted under
a #1.5 glass coverslip. Z-stacks of ddaC neurons were obtained with Zeiss confocal LSM710
microscopes with a N-Achroplan 10x 0.25 NA objective to capture the entire arbor. To extract
total dendrite length and to serve as a template for the ImageJ Sholl Analysis plugin, dendrites
were semi-manually traced with the ImageJ NeuronJ plugin (Ferreira et al., 2014; Meijering
et al., 2004). Terminal branches were manually counted on dendrite tracings with the ImageJ
multi-point tool. For FRAP experiments, L3 larvae were fillet-prepped in HL3 saline without

Ca2+ (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 115 mM
sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Fillets were transferred to a #1.5 glass bottom dished and
submerged in fresh HL3 saline with a custom-made platinum wire anchor before being
imaged on an inverted Zeiss confocal LSM510 with a Plan-Apochromat 20x 0.8 NA
objective. Bleaching of a 50 µm2 area encompassing major primary dendrites directly
adjacent to the soma was carried out by scanning for 200 iterations with 100% 488 nm
transmission. Mean fluorescence intensity of a small dendritic region contained in a 5 µm
circle 25 µm from the bleach border adjacent to the soma served as a read-out. This is the
most distant dendritic region from either bleach margin and thus the contribution to
fluorescence recovery from lateral diffusion of dendrite surface localizing CD4::tdGFP is
minimized. Bleach depth in this region was consistently greater than 87%.
Immuno-histochemistry of larval neuromuscular junctions and brains
When examining synaptic development at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), synapses
innervating muscle 6/7 of segment 3 were imaged on a Zeiss confocal LSM710 with either a
Plan-Apochromat 20x 0.8 NA or a Plan-Apochromat 63x 1.4 NA oil immersion objective.
Late-stage L3 larvae were dissected in low Ca2+ (0.2 mM) HL3 (see above). Dissected NMJ
preparations were fixed in either 4% PFA or Bouin’s solution for 10-20 min at room
temperature. Larval brains were dissected and immunostained as described previously (Wu
and Luo, 2006). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-BRP (clone nc82, DSHB),
anti-CSP (clone 6D6, DSHB), anti-GLURIIA (clone 8B4D2, DSHB), and anti-Futsch (clone
22C10, DSHB); rabbit anti-ANK2-XL (kind gift from Herman Aberle), rabbit anti-SNAP-25
(kind gift from David Deitcher), rabbit anti-GLURIII and rabbit anti-vGLUT (kind gifts from
Aaron DiAntonio), mouse anti-GFP (clone 3E6, Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-HRP
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and secondaries as above.
For quantification of synaptic development, all experiments were performed and analysed
blind to experimental genotype. Boutons were identified using anti-HRP and anti-CSP
(Zinsmaier et al., 1990). Both type 1b and type 1s boutons were included in the bouton count.
The number of BRP puncta and CSP-positive boutons was quantified using the ImageJ 3D
Object Counter Plugin (Bolte and Cordelières, 2006). Since CSP levels were reduced in
GOSR2-PME model backgrounds, CSP fluorescent signals were enhanced to saturating levels
in all genotypes prior to bouton counting.

NMJ electrophysiology
Wandering L3 larvae were dissected in ice-cold, Ca2+-free HL3.1-like solution (70 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 10 mM NaHCO3, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM
MgCl2). Motor nerves were severed just below the ventral nerve cord and the brain was
removed. CaCl2 (1 mM) was added to the bath solution for intracellular recording from
muscle 6 of abdominal segments 2-4. Sharp microelectrodes (thick-walled borosilicate glass
capillaries, pulled on a Sutter Flaming/Brown P-97 micropipette puller) were filled with 3M
KCl and had resistances of 20 – 30 MΩ. For recording of stimulus evoked excitatory post
synaptic potentials (EPSPs), severed nerves were drawn into a thin-walled glass-stimulating
pipette and stimulated with square-wave voltage pulses (0.1 ms, 10 V, A-M Systems Model
2100 Isolated Pulse Simulator). EPSPs and spontaneously-occurring miniature EPSPs
(mEPSPs) were recorded at a controlled room temperature of 22-25°C with a Geneclamp 500
amplifier (Axon Instruments) and were further amplified with a LHBF-48x amplifier (NPI
Electronic). The membrane potential was set to -70 mV with current injection at the start of
each recording. Voltage signals were low-pass filtered at 1.67 kHz (10 kHz 4 pole Bessel on
Geneclamp 500, 1.7 kHz 8-pole Bessel on LHBF-48x) and digitised at 25 kHz by a CED1401 plus A/D interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) using Spike2 software (v. 5.13)
(CED, Cambridge, UK). Synaptic potentials were analysed offline using Strathclyde
Electrophysiology Software WinEDR (v3.5.2) and GraphPad Prism (v.6). All synaptic events
were verified manually. Recordings were discarded if the initial resting membrane potential
was more positive than -60 mV or varied by more than 10% throughout the recording.
mEPSPs were recorded for a minimum of 5 min. Single EPSPs were evoked 10 times at a
standard frequency of 0.033 Hz or trains of 5 EPSPs at 10 Hz were evoked 3 times at 0.033
Hz. Intervals and amplitudes of mEPSPs were compared by creating a cumulative distribution
for each genotype of 800 measurements across 8 animals, with each animal contributing 100
values. To analyse the mEPSP waveform, a mean mEPSP was constructed for each recording
from events that showed only a single clear peak and a smooth decay so as to prevent
distortion of the waveform by closely-occurring mEPSPs.

"May 26, 2017",Exploiting The ZIP4 Homologue Within The Wheat Ph1 Locus Has Identified Two Lines Exhibiting Homoeologous Crossover In Wheat-Wild Relative Hybrids,Molecular Breeding,"[(Rey, Maria-Dolores), (Martin, Azahara C.), (Higgins, Janet), (Swarbreck, David), (Uauy, Cristobal), (Shaw, Peter), (Moore, Graham)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/142596 ,"Despite possessing related ancestral genomes, hexaploid wheat behaves as a diploid during meiosis. The wheat Ph1 locus promotes accurate synapsis and crossover of homologous chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids between wheat and wild relatives are exploited by breeders to introgress important traits from wild relatives into wheat, although in hybrids between hexaploid wheat and wild relatives, which possess only homoeologues, crossovers do not take place during meiosis at metaphase I. However, in hybrids between Ph1 deletion mutants and wild relatives, crossovers do take place. A single Ph1 deletion (ph1b) mutant has been exploited for the last 40 years for this activity. We show here that selection of chemical induced mutant lines possessing mutations in TaZIP4-B2 exhibit high levels of homoeologous crossovers when crossed with a wild relative. Exploitation of Tazip4-B2 mutants rather than mutants with whole Ph1 locus deletions may improve introgression of wild relative chromosome segments into wheat. Such mutant lines may be more stable over multiple generations, as multivalents causing accumulation of chromosome translocations are less frequent.","bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142596.

Exploiting the ZIP4 homologue within the wheat Ph1 locus has identified two wheat

31

mutants through a non-GM route, which can be exploited as an alternative to the

32

Chinese Spring ph1b mutant in wheat introgression strategies.

Abstract

35

Despite possessing related ancestral genomes, hexaploid wheat behaves as a diploid

36

during meiosis. The wheat Ph1 locus promotes accurate synapsis and crossover of

37

homologous chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids between wheat and wild relatives are

38

exploited by breeders to introgress important traits from wild relatives into wheat,

39

although in hybrids between hexaploid wheat and wild relatives, which possess only

40

homoeologues, crossovers do not take place during meiosis at metaphase I. However,

41

in hybrids between Ph1 deletion mutants and wild relatives, crossovers do take place.

42

A single Ph1 deletion (ph1b) mutant has been exploited for the last 40 years for this

43

activity. We show here that selection of chemical induced mutant lines possessing

44

mutations in TaZIP4-B2 exhibit high levels of homoeologous crossovers when

45

crossed with a wild relative. Exploitation of Tazip4-B2 mutants rather than mutants

46

with whole Ph1 locus deletions may improve introgression of wild relative

47

chromosome segments into wheat. Such mutant lines may be more stable over

48

multiple generations, as multivalents causing accumulation of chromosome

49

translocations are less frequent.

Introduction

53

Hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is composed of three related ancestral

54

genomes (A, B and D), each containing 7 identical (homologous) chromosome pairs

55

(homologue pairs 1-7). Each homologue pair has a corresponding related

56

homoeologous chromosome pair, possessing similar gene order and content, within

57

each of the other two genomes. Despite the similarity between homoeologues, wheat

58

behaves as a diploid at meiosis, with synapsis and crossovers (COs) only occurring

59

between

60

chromosomes (for example 1A only pairs with 1A but not with either 1B or 1D,

61

holding true for all seven chromosome groups). This diploid-like behaviour is

62

predominantly controlled by Ph1, a dominant locus on chromosome 5B (Riley and

63

Chapman 1958; Sears and Okamoto 1958). Sexual hybridisation between wheat and

64

wild relatives (for example rye or Aegilops variabilis) produces interspecific hybrids,

65

containing haploid sets of wheat and wild relative homoeologous chromosomes, but

66

exhibiting virtually no COs during meiosis. However, in Ph1 deleted wheat-rye

67

hybrids, an average of 7 COs per cell is observed (Sears 1977; Dhaliwal et al. 1977).

68

Such interspecific hybrids have been used to introgress important traits from wild

69

relatives into wheat.

71

Synapsis is a process early in meiosis by which homologues intimately align with

72

each other, forming bivalents held together by the proteinaceous structure or

73

synaptonemal complex (SC). Ultimately the SC is degraded, so that the bivalents are

74

then held together by chiasmata or COs at metaphase I, allowing their correct

75

segregation. Recently, Ph1 has been shown to have a dual effect on synapsis and CO

76

formation in wheat (Martín et al. 2014; Martín et al. 2017). The effect on synapsis

77

occurs during the telomere bouquet stage, when Ph1 promotes more efficient

78

homologous synapsis, thereby reducing the chance of homoeologous synapsis (Martín

79

et al. 2017). The effect on CO formation happens later in meiosis, when Ph1 prevents

80

MLH1 sites (Double Holliday Junctions marked to become COs) on synapsed

81

homoeologues from becoming COs. The Ph1 locus was defined as a deletion

82

phenotype, first described by scoring meiosis in wheat hybrids lacking the whole 5B

83

chromosome (Riley and Chapman 1958; Sears and Okamoto 1958). Exploitation of

84

smaller chromosome 5B deletions, later characterised and defined the Ph1 locus to a

85

region on chromosome 5B, containing a duplicated chromosome 3B segment carrying

86

heterochromatin and TaZIP4-B2 (originally termed Hyp3, UniProtKB - Q2L3T5),

87

inserted into a cluster of CDK2-like genes interspersed with methyl transferase genes

88

(originally termed SpG, UniProtKB- Q2L3W3) (Griffiths et al. 2006; Al-Kaff et al.

89

2008; Martín et al. 2017). Ethylmethane sulphonate (EMS) treatment failed to

90

produce mutants exhibiting the full Ph1 deletion phenotype (Griffiths et al. 2006).

91

This observation, combined with the dual activity of the Ph1 locus on synapsis and

92

COs, suggested that the Ph1 phenotype was likely to result from the activity of more

93

than a single gene (Griffiths et al. 2006).

94
95

A single Ph1 deletion mutant, developed in hexaploid wheat variety Chinese Spring

96

(CS) (CS ph1b), has been used by breeding programmes worldwide to introgress wild

97

relative chromosome segments into wheat. However, the CS ph1b mutant is reported

98

to accumulate extensive rearrangements reducing fertility (Sánchez-Morán et al.

99

2001), due to homoeologous synapsis and COs as visualised by the occurrence of

100

multivalents at metaphase I during meiosis. It would therefore be useful to identify

101

novel wheat Ph1 mutant lines, with reduced homoeologous synapsis and CO at

102

meiosis, but which do exhibit homoeologous COs in hybrids with wild-relatives. As

103

described previously, the Ph1 locus, which affects both synapsis and CO, is a

104

complex cluster of CDK2-like and methyl transferase genes containing a ZIP4

105

paralogue. It has been proposed that Ph1’s effect on synapsis is connected to altered

106

Histone H1 CDK2-dependent phosphorylation in the presence and absence of Ph1.

107

Altered phosphorylation affects chromatin structure and delays premeiotic replication,

108

subsequently affecting homologue synapsis, thus allowing homoeologous synapsis to

109

take place (Greer et al. 2012; Martín et al. 2017). Lines carrying mutations in the Ph1

110

CDK2-like homologue in Arabidopsis, also exhibit reduced synapsis under specific

111

conditions, suggesting a role for these genes in efficient synapsis (Zheng et al. 2014).

112

We have also previously proposed that the effect of CDK2-like genes on chromatin

113

structure not only affects synapsis, but might also affect the resolution of Double

114

Holliday Junctions (marked by MLH1) as COs (Greer et al. 2012). Okadaic acid

115

treatment affects chromatin structure and can induce homoeologous CO in wheat-wild

116

relative hybrids (Knight et al. 2008). However, given the locus contains multiple

117

copies of the CDK2-like and methyltransferase genes, it would be a complex and

118

laborious study to identify EMS mutants within these genes and combine possible

119

mutations. The transfer of multiple mutated genes into different elite genetic

120

backgrounds by breeders, for subsequent crossing with wild relatives, would also be

121

laborious. Moreover, as previously indicated, we want to identify wheat mutant lines

122

which exhibit reduced homoeologous synapsis or multivalents at metaphase I, so the

123

CDK2-like genes would not be the initial candidates for such an approach.

125

Although there are ZIP4 homologues on group 3 chromosomes, the ZIP4 paralogue

126

(TaZIP4-B2) within the Ph1 locus on chromosome 5B is single copy, compared to the

127

CDK2-like and methyl transferase gene cluster. Moreover, ZIP4 has been shown to

128

have a major effect on homologous COs, but not on synapsis, in both Arabidopsis and

129

rice (Chelysheva et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2012). Knockouts of this gene in diploids

130

usually result in sterility, as elimination of homologous COs leads to metaphase I

131

pairing failure and incorrect segregation. We therefore assessed whether the selection

132

and scoring of Tazip4-B2 EMS mutants would identify wheat lines with minimal

133

homoeologous synapsis and CO (as observed by the occurrence of multivalents at

134

metaphase I), but which exhibit homoeologous COs in hybrids with wild-relatives.

135

We describe the identification of two such lines through this approach.

were harvested as described in the plant material section. Anthers at late leptotene-

162

early zygotene stage were later harvested into RNA later (Ambion, Austin, TX). The

163

anthers from three plants of each genotype were pooled in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf until

164

reaching 200 to 400 anthers. Once sufficient anthers had been collected, the material

TaZIP4-B2 expression

263

In hexaploid wheat, ZIP4 homologues are located within the Ph1 locus on 5B, and

264

also on chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D. Before undertaking the targeted induced lesion

265

in genomes (tilling) mutant analysis, we assessed the expression of TaZIP4-B2 to

266

confirm: that the TaZIP4-B2 gene within the Ph1 locus was expressed during meiosis;

267

that it had a higher level of expression than those present on chromosome group 3;

268

and finally, that deletion of Ph1 significantly reduced overall ZIP4 expression. At the

269

coding DNA sequence and amino acid level, TaZIP4-B2 (AA1305800.1) showed

270

95.3% and 89.2% similarity to TaZIP4-B1 (AA0809860.1), 94.1% and 87.5% to

271

TaZIP4-A1 (AA0645950.1), and 94.4% and 87.2% to TaZIP4-D1 (AA0884100.1)

272

respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). To compare the relative expression of these ZIP4

273

homologues on chromosomes 3A, 3B, 3D and 5B, RNA samples were collected from

274

anthers of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring) (WT) and the Ph1

275

deletion mutant (ph1b) at late leptotene-early zygotene stage, and six libraries were

276

prepared for the RNA-seq study. RNA-seq analysis showed that TaZIP4-B2 exhibited

277

a higher level of expression than the ZIP4 homologues on homoeologous group 3

278

chromosomes (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, TaZIP4-B2 also showed

279

three splice variants (Supplementary Fig. 2) in contrast to homoeologous group 3

280

chromosome ZIP4 homologues. One of these splice variants (splice variant 1)

281

accounted for 97% of the TaZIP4-B2 transcripts. As expected, when the Ph1 locus

282

was deleted, the level of expression of TaZIP4-B2 was also eliminated (p < 0.05), but

283

there was no apparent increase in the transcription of the ZIP4 homologues on

284

homoeologous group 3 chromosomes, to compensate for the absence of ZIP4 on

285

chromosome 5B (p > 0.05) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). Thus, RNA-seq data

286

revealed that the expression of ZIP4 was derived mainly from the gene (TaZIP4-B2)

287

on chromosome 5B, within the Ph1 locus.

displayed to allow the identification of millions of mutations in the sequenced genes

293

(www.wheat-tilling.com) (Krasileva et al. 2017). The mutations identified are

294

accessible using the wheat survey sequence (Mayer et al. 2014) via a database, which

295

includes their location within the gene and the predicted effect that each variant has

296

on its protein. Simply searching this database reveals those plants possessing

297

mutations in the target genes, as well as a list of all mutations possessed by the plant

298

(Krasileva et al. 2017). We selected seven of the 1,200 EMS mutant lines, which

possessed

300

(Traes_5BL_9663AB85C.1) (Supplementary Table 2). Five of these mutant lines

301

exhibited regular pairing at meiotic metaphase I, so were not taken further. However,

302

two of the mutant lines (Cadenza1691 and Cadenza0348) showed reduced number of

303

COs, suggesting that their Tazip4-B2 mutations exhibit a phenotype. Both lines were

304

selected for wide crossing studies with wild relatives to score the effect of their

305

Tazip4-B2 mutations on homoeologous CO frequency in the wheat Tazip4-B2 mutant-

306

wild relative hybrids, as compared to wheat wild type-wild relative hybrids.

307

Mutations within TaZIP4-B2 were verified by sequencing, and primers were designed

308

to the mutated regions to follow mutated genes during crossing (Supplementary Fig. 3

309

and Materials and Methods). Tazip4-B2, within the Cadenza1691 mutant line,

310

possessed a missense mutation within one of the tetratricopeptide repeats (C to T

311

change leading to an A167V), shown to be important for ZIP4 function (Perry et al.

312

2005). Tazip4-B2, within the Cadenza0348 mutant line, possessed a nonsense

313

mutation (a premature stop codon: G to A change leading to W612*) (Supplementary

314

Fig. 3). In addition to these Tazip4-B2 mutations, the two mutant lines also possessed

315

mutations (mostly missense, but also splice or stop codons) within the coding

316

sequences of 106 other shared genes. Sixteen of these genes, including TaZIP4-B2,

317

were located on chromosome 5B. However, none of the genes apart from TaZIP4-B2

318

were located within the 2.5 MB Ph1 region defined in our previous study (Griffiths et

319

al. 2006; Al-Kaff et al. 2008).

Compared to the chromosome 5B deletion mutant - wild relative hybrid, no other

324

1958; Sears 1977). For example, the 3D locus Ph2, exhibits a four-fold lower level of

325

induction compared to Ph1 (Prieto et al. 2005). Equally, deleting regions of

326

chromosome 5B apart from the 2.5 MB Ph1 region did not result in homoeologous

327

CO formation at metaphase I when the lines were crossed with wild relatives (Roberts

328

et al. 1999; Griffiths et al. 2006; Al-Kaff et al. 2008). Sears (1977) used such crosses

329

between hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring, both in the presence and absence (ph1b

330

deletion) of Ph1, and the wild relative tetraploid Aegilops kotschyi (also termed Ae.

331

variabilis), to show that homoeologous COs are induced when the Ph1 locus is

332

deleted. Interspecific hybrids of the ph1b mutant and wild relatives have been

333

subsequently used in plant breeding programmes for introgression purposes (Sears

334

1977). Sears (1977) observed one rod bivalent at metaphase I in the presence of Ph1,

335

and 6.35-7.28 rod bivalents in these Ph1 absent hybrids. Chiasma frequency in the

336

hexaploid wheat-Ae. kotschyi or hexaploid wheat-Ae. variabilis hybrids, was between

337

1-3 in the presence of Ph1, and 11-14 in the absence of Ph1 (Sears 1977; Farooq et al.

338

1990; Fernández-Calvín and Orellana 1991; Kousaka and Endo 2012).

339
340

In this study, both Tazip4-B2 mutant Cadenza lines, as well as a wild type Cadenza

341

(TaZIP4-B2), were crossed with Ae. variabilis. The frequency of univalents,

342

bivalents, multivalents and total chiasma frequency was scored at meiotic metaphase I

343

in the resulting F1 hybrid (Fig. 2). In these hybrids, there were similar numbers of rod

344

bivalents to that reported by Sears (1977), with 6.75 (SE 0.17) (Cadenza1691) and

345

6.64 (SE 0.18) (Cadenza0348) rod bivalents at metaphase I in the Tazip4-B2 mutants,

346

and 1.48 rod bivalents (SE 0.12) at metaphase I in the wild type Cadenza. Moreover,

347

the chiasma mean frequency was 1.48 (SE 0.12) in the presence of Ph1 (TaZIP4-B2),

348

and 12.21 (SE 0.19) and 12.23 (SE 0.20) in the Cadenza1691-Ae. variabilis and

349

Cadenza0348-Ae. variabilis hybrids, respectively. The observed chiasma frequencies

350

at metaphase I, in the two Tazip4-B2 mutant line-Ae. variabilis hybrids, are similar to

351

those previously reported at metaphase I in the Ph1 deletion mutant (ph1b)-Ae.

352

variabilis hybrids. Thus, the data indicate that TaZIP4-B2 within the Ph1 locus is

353

likely to be involved in the suppression of homoeologous COs.

354
355

Tazip4-B2 mutant Cadenza lines show no multivalents

356

The frequencies of meiotic associations at metaphase I in hexaploid wheat and the

357

Ph1 deletion mutant (ph1b) have been reported previously (Martín et al. 2014).

358

Martín et al. (2014) observed 20 ring bivalents and one rod bivalent, with a chiasma

359

frequency of 40.97 in the presence of the Ph1 locus. However, the number of ring

360

bivalents decreased to 14.83, with a reduced chiasma frequency of 35.78, while the

361

number of rod bivalents, univalents, trivalents and tetravalents increased to 4.73, 0.80,

362

0.20 and 0.37, respectively, when the Ph1 locus was absent. The number of

363

univalents, bivalents, multivalents and chiasma frequency at meiotic metaphase I was

364

also scored in both the Tazip4-B2 mutant lines and in the wild type Cadenza (Fig. 3).

365

The Tazip4-B2 mutant lines exhibited a reduction in the number of ring bivalents at

366

metaphase I, and a slight increase in the number of rod bivalents, from a mean of 1.30

367

(SE 0.17) in the wild type Cadenza, to 3.29 (SE 0.16) in Cadenza1691 and 3.63 (SE

368

0.18) in Cadenza0348. This indicates a slight reduction in homologous COs in these

369

Tazip4-B2 mutant lines. CO frequency was a mean of 40.50 (SE 0.21) in the wild type

370

Cadenza, 38.13 (SE 0.20) in Cadenza1691 and 37.30 (SE 0.23) in Cadenza0348.

371

These observed chiasma frequencies at metaphase I in the two mutant Cadenza lines,

372

are again similar to those previously reported at metaphase I in wheat in the absence

373

of the Ph1 locus. However, no multivalents were observed, and there was no

374

significant increase in the number of univalents at metaphase I in the Tazip4-B2

375

mutant lines, as is normally observed in Ph1 deletion mutants (Roberts et al. 1999).

376
377

If Tazip4-B2 mutants had enabled homoeologues to synapse while failing to CO, then

378

a significant increase in univalents would be expected, but this was not observed. This

379

suggests that homoeologous synapsis may not be significantly affected by TaZIP4-B2.

380

On the other hand, the lack of multivalents at metaphase I suggests that both mutant

381

lines will exhibit a reduced level of homoeologous exchange or chromosome

382

translocation to that observed in the CS ph1b mutant. The ph1b mutant line has been

383

reported to accumulate extensive background translocations over multiple generations

384

due to homoeologous synapsis and COs (Sánchez-Morán et al. 2001). Thus, the

385

apparent lack of multivalents in the Tazip4-B2 mutant lines could allow their

386

exploitation for introgression purposes during plant breeding programmes, rather than

387

the current ph1b line.

388
389

In summary, seven lines carrying mutations within the TaZIP4-B2 gene were

390

screened for a phenotype with reduced homologous crossover at metaphase I. Of

391

these, two lines were identified with this phenotype, one carrying a nonsense mutation

392

within TaZip4-B2, and the other carrying a mutation in one of the key functional

393

domains of TaZip4-B2. When crossed with Ae. variabilis, both of these lines also

394

exhibited increased homoeologous crossover at metaphase I in the resulting hybrid,

395

suggesting that the two phenotypes were linked. Therefore, in this case, lines with

396

increased homoeologous crossover had been identified without an initial screen for

397

the desired phenotype. Until now, the only way by which homoeologous crossover at

398

metaphase I could be increased to this extent in wheat-wild relative hybrids was by

399

deletion of the Ph1 locus, defined as a deletion effect phenotype specific to

400

chromosome 5B. However, an alternative way of reproducing the Ph1 deletion effect

401

would be to use EMS treatment to generate nonsense or truncation mutations in the

402

homoeologous crossover-suppressing gene within the Ph1 locus. Analysis of the

403

1200-line Tilling population revealed that in any given mutant line, 1.5% of genes

404

will have a truncation allele and 2% a missense allele (Krasileva et al. 2017). Thus,

405

the probability of two mutant lines both sharing a truncation or missense mutation by

406

chance in the same second gene is P < 0.0005. The probability that two mutated genes

407

will be located on the same chromosome is extremely low (2.4 x10-5), and the

408

probability that they will both be located within the Ph1 region is even lower (2.4

409

x10-7). Thus, it is extremely unlikely that the increased homoeologous crossover

410

phenotype found in both the two Tazip4-B2 mutant lines results from a nonsense

411

mutation

412

the Ph1 locus. These mutants were identified through a non-GM route, and can be

413

exploited as an alternative to the CS ph1b mutant. Seeds for both mutants have been

414

deposited with the Germplasm Resource Unit at the John Innes Centre

415

(www.jic.ac.uk/research/germplasm-resources-unit). The accession number of seeds

for Cad0348 is W10336 and for Cad1691 is W10337. The seeds for both lines are

Abstract

15

The phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding protein 14-3-3 is known to regulate actin, this

16

function has been previously attributed to sequestration of phosphorylated cofilin. The deep

17

branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia lacks cofilin and all other canonical actin-binding proteins

18

(ABPs), and 14-3-3 was identified as an actin-associated protein in Giardia, yet its role in actin

19

regulation was unknown. Gl14-3-3 depletion resulted in an overall disruption of actin

20

organization characterized by ectopically distributed short actin filaments. Using phosphatase

21

and kinase inhibitors, we demonstrated that actin phosphorylation correlated with

22

destabilization of the actin network and increased complex formation with 14-3-3, while

23

blocking actin phosphorylation stabilized actin filaments and attenuated complex formation.

24

Giardia’s sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, modulates Gl14-3-3’s association with actin, providing

25

the first connection between GlRac and the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia. Giardia actin contains

26

two putative 14-3-3 binding motifs, one of which (S330) is conserved in mammalian actin.

27

Mutation of these sites reduced, but did not completely disrupt, the association with 14-3-3.

28

Native gels and overlay assays indicate that intermediate proteins are required to support

29

complex formation between 14-3-3 and actin. Overall, our results support a role for 14-3-3 as a

30

negative regulator of actin filament formation.

31
32

Importance

33

Giardia lacks canonical actin binding proteins. 14-3-3 was identified as an actin interactor but

34

the significance of this interaction was unknown. Loss of 14-3-3 results in ectopic short actin

35

filaments, indicating that 14-3-3 is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia.

36

Drug studies indicate that 14-3-3 complex formation is in part phospho-regulated. We

37

demonstrate that complex formation is downstream of Giardia’s sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac,

38

this result provides the first mechanistic connection between GlRac and actin in Giardia. Native

39

gels and overlay assays indicate intermediate proteins are required to support the interaction

40

between 14-3-3 and actin suggesting that 14-3-3 is regulating multiple actin complexes. Overall,

41

we find that 14-3-3 is a negative regulator of actin filament formation in Giardia.

42
43

Introduction

44

14-3-3 belongs to a family of highly conserved eukaryotic proteins whose role is to regulate

45

target proteins through binding of specific phosphoserine/phosphothreonine motifs. Through

46

recognition and binding of these specific motifs, 14-3-3 functions in a variety of cellular

47

processes, including cytoskeletal regulation and function as an adapter protein that can

48

activate/inhibit protein function, change intracellular localization of bound cargos, or mediate

49

formation of multi-protein complexes (1-8). In the current model for higher eukaryotes, 14-3-3

50

regulates actin through phospho-dependent sequestration of the actin-depolymerizing protein,

51

cofilin (4, 9). The existence of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms in higher eukaryotes complicates the

52

relationship between 14-3-3 and actin, leading to discrepant results about whether 14-3-3

53

directly interacts with actin (2). Consistent with additional interaction/regulatory mechanisms,

54

actin has been identified as an interactor of 14-3-3 in plant and animal 14-3-3 proteomic

55

datasets where cofilin was not found (10-12). Indeed, 14-3-3σ was recently reported to be

56

upregulated in breast cancer cells, where it forms a complex with actin and intermediate

57

filament proteins that is utilized for cell motility during breast tumor invasion (13). The complex

58

was also found to play a role in actin sequestration, as depletion of 14-3-3σ led to an increase in

59

filamentous actin. Whether complex formation between monomeric actin and 14-3-3 is broadly

60

utilized mechanism of actin regulation remains an open question.

61
62

Giardia lamblia (synonymous with G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis), is a protozoan parasite

63

that belongs to a deep-branching group of eukaryotes known as Excavata. Giardia, in

64

concordance with its phylogenetic position, has an evolutionarily divergent actin with only 58%

65

average identity to other actin homologs and lacks the canonical actin-binding proteins once

66

thought common to all eukaryotes (Arp2/3 complex, formin, wave, myosin, cofilin, etc.) (14-16).

67

Other excavates, such as Trichomonas vaginalis and Spironucleus salmonicida, also lack many

68

canonical actin-binding proteins suggesting that the core actin regulators conserved in plants,

69

animals, and fungi may not have solidified their cellular roles before the ancestors of these

70

excavates branched from the eukaryotic tree (17-20). Nevertheless, Giardia actin (GlActin)

71

functions in conserved cellular processes including membrane trafficking, cytokinesis, polarity,

72

and control of cellular morphology (21). The mechanism for actin recruitment and regulation

73

for these processes remains poorly understood. The only conserved actin regulator identified in

74

Giardia is a Rho family GTPase, GlRac, which can promote changes in actin organization without

75

any of the actin-binding proteins known to link small G-protein signaling to the actin

76

cytoskeleton (21). Notably, 14-3-3 has been shown to integrate G-protein signaling to the actin

77

and tubulin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium discoideum (7); thus, it potentially links GlRac to the

78

actin cytoskeleton in Giardia. Through actin affinity chromatography and MudPIT analysis, the

79

single 14-3-3 homolog (Gl14-3-3) of Giardia was identified as an actin-associated protein (19).

80

Likewise, actin has been identified as part of the 14-3-3 interactome in Giardia (22). Here we

81

set out to address whether 14-3-3 has a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, characterize

82

the nature of the interaction, and determine if Giardia’s sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, is

83

upstream of this association.

84
85

Results

86

We previously reported that 14-3-3 complexes with actin and the biochemical conditions used

87

to isolate interactors suggested the interaction was likely with monomeric G-actin (19).

88

Pulldown of TwinStrep-tagged GlActin (TS-actin) supports this assertion. Cleared lysates (Figure

89

1A) contain both endogenous GlActin and TS-actin. If 14-3-3 bound to F-actin or complexes

90

containing dimeric actin, then the filaments would contain a mixture of native and tagged actin.

91

After pulldown with StrepTactin resin in buffers not expected to support filament formation,

92

only TS-actin was detected (Figure 1A). This finding is consistent with the 14-3-3 complex

93

containing monomeric actin, but does not exclude interaction with F-actin.

94
95

Actin levels in Giardia have yet to be measured; assignment of the intracellular concentration

96

relative to the critical concentration has important regulatory implications. If the concentration

97

of actin is above the critical concentration, then Giardia would require a mechanism to

98

sequester actin. We questioned whether there would be sufficient 14-3-3 to bind and modulate

99

actin function. Using purified proteins as standards and custom antibodies to GlActin and Gl14-

100

3-3, we measured actin and 14-3-3 concentrations in Giardia trophozoite extracts. We found

101

that 10 µg of extract contained 102.5±7.4 ng of Gl14-3-3 and 70.7± 16.4 ng of GlActin or ~1.8

102

picomoles of 14-3-3 dimer and ~1.7 picomoles of actin (Figure S1). Our measurement of actin at

103

70 ng per 10 µg of total cellular extract can be extrapolated to ~4.7 µM actin (16,927 cells=10

104

µg; 1cell=199.8µm3 (23)). Compared with other eukaryotes, this actin concentration is relatively

105

low; yet, the value is at least 5x higher than the concentration needed to form filaments (21),

106

indicating that some level of actin sequestration is likely needed to properly regulate filament

107

formation.

108
109

Since 14-3-3 has a role in regulating cell division in other eukaryotes, we examined the

110

localization of an endogenously C-terminally tagged version of Gl14-3-3 (Gl14-3-3-HA)(19); see

111

Figure 1B for a diagram of Giardia cellular landmarks. In interphase cells, 14-3-3 is distributed

112

throughout the cell with some enrichment at the cortex, nuclear envelope, and in association

113

with the intracytoplasmic axonemes of the anterior flagella. In mitotic cells, 14-3-3

114

disassociated with the intracytoplasmic axonemes but maintained association with the nuclear

115

envelopes/spindles (Figure 1C). Notably, we previously demonstrated a central role for actin in

116

positioning the flagella and nuclei (21). Gl14-3-3 was also associated with the ingressing furrow,

117

which does not utilize a contractile ring (Figure 1C). We recently reported that actin levels are

118

reduced just ahead of the advancing furrow cortex, and actin is required for abscission but not

119

furrow progression (Hardin et al, in review). Enrichment of Gl14-3-3 just ahead of the furrow

120

cortex may indicate a negative actin regulatory function for Gl14-3-3 and/or a role in regulating

121

membrane trafficking (Figure 1C). Consistent with 14-3-3 having a role in regulating membrane

122

trafficking (6), Gl14-3-3-HA is associated with the nuclear envelope/ER and the bare area of the

123

ventral disc (Figure 1D). This void in the disc lacks microtubules and serves as a conduit for

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142505. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

124

vesicle trafficking whereas the rest of the disc is composed of a sheet of microtubules and

125

associated proteins that would physically prevent vesicle transport (24). The Gl14-3-3-HA fusion

126

protein did not appear to co-localize with filamentous actin (F-actin) structures and is

127

consistent with our finding that Gl14-3-3 complexes with monomeric actin.

128
129

To ascertain whether Gl14-3-3 has a role in cytoskeletal regulation in Giardia, we depleted

130

Gl14-3-3 with an antisense translation-blocking morpholino. Knockdown of Gl14-3-3 protein

131

expression was monitored by immunoblotting to detect the integrated copy of Gl14-3-3-HA. On

132

average, a 70% reduction in Gl14-3-3-HA levels was observed 24 hours after morpholino

133

treatment and parasite growth was dramatically reduced in the knockdown population versus

134

the non-specific morpholino control, indicating a key role in cell proliferation (Figure 2A, B).

135

Depletion of Gl14-3-3 disrupted characteristic actin organization and resulted in small bright

136

puncta distributed throughout the cell (Figure 2C, S2). Detailed examination revealed that the

137

puncta are short filaments below 1 µm in length (Figure 2D, Movie S1). Depletion of Gl14-3-3

138

also led to polarity and cytokinesis defects, indicating that Gl14-3-3 has a role in regulating both

139

the actin and tubulin cytoskeletal organization (Figure 2E, S2). The loss of cell polarity,

140

accumulation of multinucleate cells, reduction in cell growth, and abnormal flagella positioning

141

associated with Gl14-3-3 depletion are phenotypes also observed in GlActin depleted Giardia

142

(21). These results strongly indicate that 14-3-3 is linked to actin regulation in Giardia.

143
144

Since actin phosphorylation occurs in several eukaryotes (25-31) and 14-3-3 binding usually

145

requires Ser/Thr target phosphorylation, the effect of kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142505. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

146

actin/14-3-3 complex stability was studied. The Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A and

147

the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine are both effective in Giardia (32), likely affecting the

148

phosphorylation state of multiple proteins. Using Phos-Tag phosphate-affinity electrophoresis

149

(33), we find that a portion of actin is indeed phosphorylated in Giardia extracts, (Figure 3A),

150

suggesting phosphorylation could be an important actin regulatory mechanism. After 45

151

minutes of treatment with either staurosporine or calyculin A, the level of actin

152

phosphorylation increased following treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor and decreased

153

as a result of treatment with the kinase inhibitor, respectively (Figure 3A). Treatment of the cell

154

extracts with lambda protein phosphatase effectively depletes the shifted band demonstrating

155

the specificity of our actin antibody. Remarkably, our ability to co-immunoprecipitate actin with

156

Gl14-3-3-HA correlated with the phosphorylation level of actin and is consistent with phospho-

157

dependent regulation of the 14-3-3-actin interaction (Figure 3B, 3C).

158
159

Next we asked whether modulating the phosphorylation level of actin could affect the balance

160

between F and G-actin. Actin extraction assays were performed after treatment of parasites

161

with staurosporine or calyculin A. Phosphatase inhibition with calyculin A increased extractable

162

actin from 12.2% in DMSO treated control cells to 30.4% (n=3, p<0.05). No reduction in

163

extractable actin was observed after treatment with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (Figure

164

3D, 3E), possibly due to the limited sensitivity of this assay coupled with our observation that

165

only a small pool of actin is free to begin with. These results do show that actin phosphorylation

166

is correlated with a shift in the balance toward soluble, presumably, G-actin and association

167

with 14-3-3.

168
169

The increased association of Gl14-3-3 with actin that results from calyculin A treatment could

170

indirectly result from increased monomeric actin levels. Therefore, we sought to assess

171

whether increased monomeric actin in the absence of increased phosphorylation could

172

promote complex formation with Gl14-3-3. Mutation of Arg 62, a key residue also conserved in

173

GlActin, to Asp (R62D) has been shown to result in polymerization defective β-actin (34). To

174

monitor the mutant actin isoform, TS-actin was mutated and transformed into a Gl14-3-3-HA

175

expressing parasite line. In Gl14-3-3-HA immunoprecipitation, both TS-actinR62D and control TS-

176

actin co-precipitated in similar ratios as compared with endogenous GlActin (Figure 3F, 3G).

177

This result suggests that the association between GlActin and Gl14-3-3 promoted by calyculin

178

depends on increased actin phosphorylation rather than an increased amount of monomeric

179

actin. To confirm that 14-3-3 complexes with phosphorylated actin, pulldowns of 14-3-3-TS

180

were performed and the phosphorylation state of the associated actin was assessed with Phos-

181

tag gels and western blotting. Indeed, compared with input, the phosphorylated forms of actin

182

were enriched in 14-3-3-TS pulldown (Figure 3H); however, most of the co-immunoprecipitated

183

actin was not phosphorylated. The presence of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated

184

actin in association with 14-3-3 indicates multiple modes of 14-3-3 association, which could

185

include both direct binding and recruitment through actin binding proteins.

186
187

Since modulating actin phosphorylation changed the balance between F and G-actin, we

188

anticipated that this would be apparent as changes in cellular actin organization. To verify this

189

hypothesis, cells were treated with calyculin A or staurosporine for 30 minutes and then stained

190

for GlActin and Gl14-3-3-HA or tubulin. Treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A

191

resulted in an apparent decrease in the robustness of actin structures and enrichment of Gl14-

192

3-3 along the intracytoplasmic axonemes of the anterior flagella (Figure 4A). More severely

193

impacted cells (27%, 83/300) lost cytoskeletal organization and became spherical (Figure 4B).

194

Conversely, treatment with staurosporine led to increased cortical actin and brightly labeled F-

195

actin structures, the most apparent of which are at the anterior of the cell (Figure 4A).

196

Prominent actin filaments associated with the nuclei of staurosporine-treated cells were also

197

apparent (Figure 4B and C). In 30% (90/300) of staurosporine treated cells, we observed an

198

aberrant structure containing actin and 14-3-3 in proximity to the ventral disc, suggesting that

199

membrane trafficking is also impaired (Figure 4C, asterisk). Nuclear size was also increased.

200

Staurosporine treatment led to prominent nuclear actin filaments and a corresponding 89%

201

increase in nuclear area compared to DMSO-treated control cells (p<0.001, n=43 Ctrl, n=32

202

Staur). This phenotype suggests that actin regulates nuclear size in Giardia. Overall,

203

phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton appears to be correlated with Gl14-3-3 association and

204

cytoskeletal disassembly while inhibiting phosphorylation with staurosporine stabilized

205

cytoskeletal structures.

206
207

Next we reasoned that if Gl14-3-3 acts as a negative regulator of actin filament formation

208

through sequestration of actin and/or actin regulatory proteins in Giardia, Rho GTPase signaling

209

should act upstream of 14-3-3-actin complex formation. Expression of an inducible N-terminally

210

HA-tagged constitutively active Q74L GlRac (HA-RacCA; equivalent to Q61L Rac1) was previously

211

observed to increase overall actin fluorescence, which we suggested was due to increased

212

filament formation (21). Indeed, detailed analysis revealed the formation of prominent GlActin

213

filaments at the cell cortex (Figure 5A). Induction of the HA-RacCA mutant protein lead to a

214

decrease in the amount of actin that co-immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3-VSVG (Figure 5B). This

215

is consistent with 14-3-3 acting as a negative regulator of filament formation where the

216

monomeric 14-3-3 actin complex(s) must be reduced to facilitate filament formation. This result

217

provides the first insight toward understanding how Rho GTPase signaling regulates actin in

218

Giardia without any of the conserved proteins that normally link Rho GTPases and the actin

219

cytoskeleton.

220
221

After demonstrating that 14-3-3-actin complex levels could be modulated, we sought to

222

determine if there are binding motifs in GlActin that could support direct interaction with Gl14-

223

3-3. The 14-3-3-Pred prediction algorithm tool identified S330 (RVRIpSSP) and S338 (RKYpSAW)

224

as the highest scoring predicted interaction sites (35). In agreement, the same sites were

225

previously reported using a custom algorithm to identify binding sites in putative Giardia 14-3-3

226

interactors (22). These sites are similar to the canonical mode 1 site RXXp(S/T)XP [where p(S/T)

227

are phosphorylated serine or threonine residues]; while not a perfect match, many 14-3-3

228

interacting proteins have been found that lack canonical mode 1-3 binding motifs (3, 35, 36). To

229

assess the potential involvement of these sites, TS-actin was mutated to generate a

230

S330A/S338A double mutant. The wild type and mutant TS-Actin constructs were introduced

231

into the endogenously tagged Gl14-3-3-HA parasite line. Phos-tag gel analysis of the

232

S330A/S338A double mutant, confirms that at least one of these two sites is phosphorylated

233

(Figure 6B, C). The double mutant as well as single point mutants had reduced capacity to co-

234

precipitate 14-3-3-HA (Figure 6D). The mean reduction in 14-3-3 binding was similar for S330A,

235

S338A, and S330A/S338A double mutant. The double mutant, however, showed more

236

consistent reduction as noted by error bar size in Figure 6E. Incomplete disruption of the 14-3-3

237

interaction could indicate that part of the 14-3-3 recruitment is mediated by association with

238

actin binding proteins, but could also indicate the presence of additional interaction sites. Thus

239

we also tested the possible involvement of T162 (VTHpTVP), a conserved residue identified by

240

Scansite 3 as the highest scoring 14-3-3 interaction site (37). However, mutation of T162 to

241

alanine did not disrupt 14-3-3-actin interaction, consistent with structure homology modeling

242

that suggested this residue was not surface accessible (Figure S3). These results are in line with

243

S330 and S338 having a role in promoting 14-3-3 and monomeric actin complex formation.

244

However, our inability to completely disrupt actin complex formation indicates additional

245

means for 14-3-3 association with actin.

To test whether Gl14-3-3 can directly bind GlActin, overlay experiments were performed using

248

a 6XHis-GlActin expressed in and purified from Giardia extracts to ensure native

249

phosphorylation. The overlay was performed with either the recombinant wild type GST-fused

250

Gl14-3-3 or with the mutant GST-K53E, previously shown to be binding defective (38, 39).

251

Binding of GST-Gl14-3-3 near the molecular weight of 6XHis-GlActin was not observed (Figure

252

7A). Instead, GST-Gl14-3-3 bound to four bands on the blot corresponding to proteins co-

253

purified with 6XHis-GlActin. The most prominent labeling is associated with a major co-purified

254

protein at 80 kD also seen in silver staining. Immunoblotting with an anti-pSer antibody

255

confirmed that a fraction of actin was phosphorylated, as well as some co-purified proteins,

256

including the 80 kD protein band (Figure 7A). This result confirms that some of the 14-3-3-actin

257

interaction is due to recruitment through additional binding partners that can mediate the

258

formation of a complex containing both Gl14-3-3 and GlActin. The inability to bind directly to

259

actin could reflect a requirement for actin to be natively folded or that the interaction site is

260

low affinity and additional proteins are needed to stabilize binding (40).

261
262

To assess whether Giardia contains a 14-3-3 complex appropriately sized for direct interaction,

263

we turned to native gel electrophoresis. If a 14-3-3-actin complex formed without any

264

additional proteins, it would contain a dimer of 14-3-3 (41) and a single TS-actin monomer.

265

Previous native gel analysis indicates that 14-3-3 dimers run at ~80 kD (41) and TS-actin is 45.2

266

kD; taking into account the size of the 3XHA tag (3.8KD) the anticipated complex size for direct

267

binding is around 130 kD. TS-actin and associated proteins were purified and immediately run

268

on native gels and transferred to membrane for western blotting. A prominent band of 14-3-3

269

was detected running between the 66 and 140 kD native gel markers (Figure 7B). However, a

270

similarly sized band is also apparent in the input, suggesting this band represents free 14-3-3

271

dimer and that the complexes were unstable. In an effort to stabilize actin complexes, we used

272

the membrane permeable crosslinker DSP to crosslink samples before lysis. Crosslinking did

273

change the distribution of actin and a prominent actin band running just below 146 kD was

274

enriched in the pulldown (Figure 7B); however, a corresponding enrichment of 14-3-3 was not

275

apparent. Instead, the higher molecular weight smear of 14-3-3 became more prominent,

276

consistent with multiple actin interactors having the capacity to bind actin. Future work will be

277

required to identify these 14-3-3-actin interacting proteins and determine their specific roles in

278

regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Although the relationship between 14-3-3 and actin appears

279

to be more complicated than we initially imagined, our results indicate that 14-3-3 plays a

280

decisive role in actin regulation.

281

Discussion

282

Proteomic studies support complex formation between 14-3-3 and actin without the

283

involvement of cofilin (10-12, 22). A recent study of 14-3-3σ function in the basal-like

284

progression of breast cancer cells found that 14-3-3σ forms a complex containing actin and two

285

intermediate filament proteins (13). Analogous to what we have reported here, the 14-3-3σ

286

complex sequesters soluble actin in a bioavailable form that is then used for directional

287

assembly of the cytoskeleton during cell migration. Similarly, Giardia appears to use Gl14-3-3 to

288

restrict actin assembly at specific subcellular regions as evidenced by the 14-3-3 knockdown

289

experiments where actin filaments were dispersed throughout the cell and typical actin

290

organization was lost.

291
292

We estimated the intracellular concentration of actin to be around 4.7 µM. This relatively low

293

concentration is nevertheless above the critical concentration for GlActin (21), indicating the

294

need for actin sequestration. The emerging view of actin network homeostasis is that

295

sequestering proteins play an important role in partitioning actin to competing F-actin networks

296

(42, 43). In other eukaryotes, the concentration of sequestering proteins exceed the actin

297

monomer pool (44), but Giardia lacks all known monomer sequestering proteins. Our results

298

indicate that 14-3-3 is associated with monomeric actin in complexes with other interaction

299

partners (Figure 7) and that complex formation has a reverse correlation with actin filament

300

formation (Figure 3, 4, 5). Therefore, it seems likely that 14-3-3 functions in the partitioning of

301

actin complexes for sub-functionalization in addition to having a role in maintenance of G/F-

302

actin homeostasis.

303
304

Complex formation between 14-3-3 and actin appears to be both phosphodependent and

305

independent. The putative 14-3-3 phospho-binding motif centered on S338 is conserved in

306

mammalian actin and has previously been implicated as an AKT phosphorylation site (45). The

307

14-3-3 binding site prediction tool 14-3-3PRED identified S338 as the highest scoring site for

308

both GlActin and human β-actin. We have shown this site as well as S330, contribute to 14-3-3

309

recruitment and at least one of these predicted interaction sites is phosphorylated as shown by

310

a change in mobility on Phos-tag gels. Our ability to perform biochemical assays with Giardia’s

311

highly divergent actin remains limited. Overlay assays and native gels did not provide support

312

for direct interaction between 14-3-3 and actin. However, it remains possible that some of the

313

observed complexes contain 14-3-3 directly bound to actin with additional interactors that

314

work to stabilize the complex (40). Indeed the 14-3-3σ complex contains two intermediate

315

filament proteins, yet in vitro actin polymerization assays containing only actin and 14-3-3

316

demonstrated that 14-3-3 could directly regulate actin dynamics (13). The need for additional

317

proteins to stabilize the 14-3-3 interaction with S330 and S338 would reconcile our data;

318

however, a caveat is that these point mutants could have disrupted actin folding and therefore

319

disrupted the binding of proteins that recruit 14-3-3. While we have yet to pursue proteins that

320

associate with both 14-3-3 and actin, independent proteomic studies aimed at identifying 14-3-

321

3 and actin interactors point towards proteins of interest (19, 22). Besides actin and 14-3-3

bioRxiv preprint first posted online May. 26, 2017; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/142505. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

322

there are 14 proteins in common between the two studies (Table S1). Eight of these proteins

323

belong to the highly conserved Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT; MW 56.3-64.7 kD) which is

324

known to have a role in actin folding (46). The TCP-1 epsilon subunit has been implicated in the

325

regulation of actin dynamics and this subunit has two, albeit untested, canonical mode 1 14-3-3

326

recognition motif (22, 47). Intriguingly, the epsilon subunit was the most abundant component

327

of the TCP-1 complex found in our actin interactome. The list also includes TIP49

328

(GL50803_9825, 51.4 kD), which we have validated as a robust actin interactor through

329

reciprocal pulldown (19). Other proteins include an SMC domain protein (GL50803_6886, 102.8

330

kD), two dynein heavy chain proteins (GL50803_111950, 570.3 kD; GL50803_42285, 834.7 kD),

331

and two proteins without any conserved domains (GL50803_15251, 32.5kD; GL50803_15120,

332

26.6 kD). All of these proteins have at least one canonical mode 1 14-3-3 recognition motif but

333

whether they are involved in recruiting 14-3-3 to actin complexes remains to be determined.

334
335

Overall, our results support a role for 14-3-3 associating with monomeric actin complexes that

336

are downstream of GlRac, where phosphorylated actin and phosphorylated actin interactors

337

are held inactive. This work illustrates the conserved role of 14-3-3 as an actin regulator albeit

338

through an alternative set of actin binding proteins which remain to be identified and validated.

Figure 3. 14-3-3-Actin complex formation is phosphodependent. (A) Immunoblot after Phos-

tag phosphate-affinity electrophoresis. Cells were pre-treated with DMSO or inhibitors and

494

then HALT phosphatase inhibitor (HALT PI) was added at lysis to preserve the phosphorylation

state. Calyculin A treatment increased phosphorylated-actin levels (P-actin) and the kinase

496

inhibitor staurosporine reduced P-actin. Phosphoisoforms were removed after lambda protein

phosphatase treatment. (B) Immunoprecipitation of Gl14-3-3-HA after calyculin A treatment led

498

to increased actin interaction while staurosporine treatment reduced the association of actin

intracytoplasmic caudal flagella axonemes which are typically associated with actin, note

calyculin A treatment resulted in loss of actin association with this structure while

Figure 7. 14-3-3-actin complex formation requires intermediate proteins. An immunoblot of

541

affinity purified 6xHis-GlActin (His-Actin) or mock purification from wildtype trophozoites was

542

assessed by overlay with recombinant GST-Gl14-3-3 or the 14-3-3 binding defective mutant

543

GST-K53E. Interaction of GST-Gl14-3-3 with actin and co-purified proteins was revealed by

544

incubation with anti-GST-HRP. The same membrane was stripped and probed with mouse anti-

545

GlActin and again with mouse mAb anti-pSer. Silver stained protein purifications are shown in

546

the last inset. Molecular size markers (kDa) are on the left. The position of His-Actin is indicated

547

on the right. (B) Affinity purified TS-actin was run on SDS Page and NativePAGE. The native gel

548

analysis includes DSP crosslinked samples to preserve native complexes. Note that DSP

549

treatment reduces the amount of ~100kD dimeric 14-3-3 (red arrowhead) and increases the

550

high molecular weight smear. The position of putative monomeric TS-actin (45.2 kD expected

551

size) is marked with a green arrowhead.

Animals communicate using signals perceived via multiple sensory modalities

27

but usually invest more heavily in one of type of signal. This pattern, observed by

28

Darwin1 and many researchers since, led to development of the transfer

29

hypothesis (see also transferal effect2 and tradeoff hypothesis3,4), which predicts a

30

negative relationship between investment in different signaling modalities

38

World warblers (Parulidae), and to estimate temporal patterns in the

50

different sensory modalities. This interaction between mechanisms shaping

51

signals may be a major determinant in the evolution of animal communication.

52
53

Ever since Darwin1, naturalists have noted a negative relationship between bright

54

colors and the elaboration of songs involved in animal communication. For example,

55

“... in territorial passerine birds, there tends to be an inverse relation between the

56

development of auditory distinctiveness (song of species with cryptic behavior and

57

coloration, e.g., grasshopper warbler, chiffchaff) and visual distinctiveness (pattern of

58

species with conspicuous behavior, e.g., stonechat, pied flycatcher)...” 6. Such

59

observations led to the postulation of the transferal effect2,7 or tradeoff hypothesis3

60

(later named transfer hypothesis), which states that the complexity of signals in

61

different modalities should be negatively related. Animals are expected to invest

62

primarily in one type of signal (i.e., vocal, chemical, or visual8) owing to various

63

factors, including internal limitations in energy expenditure (classical life-history

64

tradeoffs9,10), predators11, parasites12, physical conditions of the habitat2, and the

65

conflicting forces of sexual and natural selection12. Despite the generality and

66

popularity of this hypothesis, there have been few13–15 attempts to test it with a robust,

67

phylogenetically informed data set that includes variation in multiple signal

68

modalities and covariation with the signaling habitat that influences the salience of

69

these signals.

70
71

Here, we test for a negative relationship between elaboration in song and plumage

72

coloration in the context of the signaling habitat, thus linking the transfer hypothesis

73

with another leading hypothesis posed to account for signal evolution, namely sensory

74

drive5. The sensory drive hypothesis posits that variation in habitat features leads to

75

variation in selection pressures by affecting the ease with which different traits are

76

perceived. For example, because the use of visual signals for communication in dark

77

habitats (e.g. forest understory, turbid waters) is expected to be ineffective5,16, acoustic

78

or olfactory signals should be more prevalent as targets of sexual selection in such

79

environments. In turn, in open areas or clear waters one expects visual signals to be

80

more elaborate than vocal or chemical signals. Although several studies have

81

supported the sensory drive hypothesis, they have largely focused on a single

82

communication channel (i.e., visual15,17–20, olfactory16, or acoustic signals21–23) and

83

have not considered interactions among channels as those implied by the transfer

84

hypothesis. Similarly, the few existing examinations of the transfer hypothesis13–15,24

85

have not considered the influence of habitat on signal salience.

86
87

Using data on plumage, song, and habitat, we examined correlations between visual

88

and acoustic signals mediated by the environment across a large radiation of passerine

89

birds. The New World warblers (Parulidae) are a group of small, often colorful,

90

primarily insectivorous oscines with diverse songs and a broad diversity of habitat

91

affinities and life histories25. The tuning of the visual system of warblers varies with

92

habitat and this should generate differential, habitat-specific selection on visual

93

signals. Expression of opsins varies with the light environment occupied by different

94

species26; specifically, short-wavelength sensitive type 2 opsins (SWS2) are shifted to

95

longer wavelengths in species living in closed forest environments27 where most of

96

the short wavelengths are filtered by vegetation28. In addition, female expression of

97

these same opsins varies with plumage dichromatism, suggesting a role for sensory

98

drive26.

100

In analyses that did not account for the habitat preferences of species, we found no

101

support for the prediction of the transfer hypothesis that elaboration in plumage

102

coloration (chromatic diversity of plumage and chromatic contrast to the back) and

103

song traits (vocal deviation -a measure of vocal performance-, syllable variety and

104

song length) should be negatively related (Table 1, 2). However, when we included

105

vegetation structure as a covariate (i.e., open vs. closed habitats), significant negative

106

relationships between variables emerged, suggesting that apparent transfers in

107

investment between signals in different communication channels are mediated by

108

habitat. Specifically, chromatic contrast to background (β= -6.79, t= -2.69, p=0.01)

109

and chromatic diversity of plumage were negatively related to song syllable variety

110

(β= -1.51, t= -3.31, p=0.001, Table 1), such that species with less colorful plumage

111

exhibit songs with a greater variety of syllables and live in closed habitats (β = 1.96,

112

t= 2.76, p=0.008). Additionally, achromatic diversity of plumage was significantly

113

related to vegetation structure (β= 3.22, t= -2.16, p=0.03, Table 2) and to vocal

114

deviation (β= 1.6290, t=2.0145, p=0.05, Fig. 1); this indicates that birds with darker

115

backs live in darker habitats and communicate using songs demanding greater

116

performance. A plausible interpretation of these results is that in forest species natural

117

selection to reduce conspicuousness due to predation has resulted in a match between

118

plumage coloration and background color; this has presumably triggered an

119

investment transfer between visual and vocal signals, resulting in more elaborate

120

songs favored by sexual selection. These patterns we found are uniquely predicted by

121

a combination of the transfer and sensory drive hypotheses.

122
123

A more specific prediction of the transfer hypothesis considers not only the

124

evolutionary end points of elaboration in visual versus vocal signals, but the dynamic

125

processes that gave rise to their negative relationship. Analyses of the accumulation of

126

disparity in color and vocal traits along the New World warbler phylogeny suggest a

127

negative evolutionary correlation between these two different types of signals across

128

time. Relative to a null process of accumulation of phenotypic disparity (i.e., under a

129

Brownian-motion process of evolution), chromatic (chromatic diversity of plumage

130

and chromatic contrast to background) and achromatic (achromatic diversity of

131

plumage) disparity in coloration accumulated at a faster rate near the tips of the

132

phylogeny (Fig. 1), indicating divergence among closely related taxa. Accumulation

133

in disparity in song length and syllable variety also differed from the null but, by

134

contrast, peaked around the middle of the clade’s history and not near the present.

135

Taken together, patterns of evolutionary change in plumage and song traits appear to

136

be decoupled: when there were bursts in accumulation in disparity in song length and

137

syllable variety, disparity in plumage coloration did not deviate from the null and vice

138

versa (Fig. 1). In other words, it appears that when one set of traits diversified at a

139

relatively high rate the other did not, as predicted by the transfer hypothesis. The

140

pattern of disparity through time estimated for vegetation structure closely mirrored

141

patterns observed for plumage coloration variables (Fig. 1). This suggests that

142

diversification in coloration in warblers may have been linked to shifts between

143

habitats differing in light availability and color properties as predicted by the sensory

144

drive hypothesis. In contrast to traits involved in visual and acoustic communication,

145

morphological traits (i.e., body mass and bill size) accumulated disparity as expected

146

under a Brownian-motion model of evolution.

147
148

Considering vegetation structure allowed us to reveal a negative association between

149

vocal and visual signals that was otherwise absent when vegetation structure was not

150

considered a covariate. We thus conclude that the signaling environment mediates the

151

evolution of the relationship between vocal and visual signals, resulting in negative

152

relationships between the degree of elaboration of different types of signals (i.e.,

153

apparent transferal effects). A variety of studies have tested the transfer hypothesis in

154

birds, with mixed results: finches and avenue-building bowerbirds exhibit negative

155

relationships between acoustic and visual signals24,29, but no evidence of such apparent

156

transference has been found in trogons15, Asian barbets14 or tanagers13. In other groups

157

like butterflies30, fishes16,31 and plants32, there is evidence of negative relationships

158

between signals driven by the properties of the habitat. For example, in turbid waters

159

sticklebacks rely more on olfactory cues to attract mates than in clear waters31,33,

160

suggesting a transference from visual signals to chemical signals, mediated by habitat.

161
162

Our study offers strong support for the transfer hypothesis, but only when it is

163

considered in the context of sensory drive. Transfer in signal investment occurs when

164

there are differential costs and benefits of signals in different modalities. Our results

165

suggest that these differential costs and benefits need not occur because of internal

166

physiological or developmental constraints as previously suggested, but can be

167

generated by the saliency of signals in their local habitat. We conclude that to

168

understand the diversity of multimodal communication strategies it is necessary to

169

address not only the magnitude of investment in signaling modalities but also the

170

selective forces that influence their salience.

METHODS SUMMARY

173

We measured coloration in New World warblers using museum specimens with an

174

Ocean Optics (Dunedin, FL) USB2000 spectrophotometer and a PX-2 pulsed xenon

175

light source to record reflectance across the avian visual spectrum. For each specimen,

176

we measured all plumage patches we observed that appeared to be differently colored

177

to the human eye along 40 measurement points in ventral and dorsal sides. With these

178

data, we constructed three variables describing colors: (1) chromatic and (2)

179

achromatic diversity, and (3) contrast to background, assuming that the color in of the

180

backs matched the color of the background, we can use that variable as a proxy of the

181

color of the background where birds live. Chromatic and achromatic diversity were

182

calculated by comparing the contrast between every color measured on each specimen

183

using the library pavo47, implemented in R.

184
185

We used data on song length, syllable variety and vocal deviation from a previous

186

study46 as measurements of song elaboration13 in New World warblers. We explored

187

the evolutionary history of communication signals (visual and acoustic) in New

188

World warblers (Parulidae) using comparative methods designed to understand the

189

patterns of evolution of traits along a phylogeny34 (DTT plots) and phylogenetic

190

generalized least squares (PGLS)35 models to test for relationships between variables

191

predicted by the transfer hypothesis and sensory drive.

METHODS

359

We explored the evolutionary history of communication signals using comparative

360

methods designed to understand the patterns of evolution of traits along a phylogeny34

361

(disparity through time [DTT] plots) and phylogenetic generalized least squares

362

(PGLS)35 to evaluate different models. We focused on New World warblers

363

(Parulidae), which have evolved in contrasting habitat types, and differ in

364

communication strategies to study the evolution of communication signals.

365
366

Plumage conspicuousness

367

We measured coloration in New World warblers using museum specimens. In total

368

we measured 231 study skins of 51 species (see Supplement) in the collections at the

369

Museum of Natural Science at Louisiana State University (LSUMZ). To avoid any

370

effects of specimen age on reflectance measures17,36 the most recent specimens with

371

the freshest looking plumage for each species were chosen. We used an Ocean Optics

372

(Dunedin, FL) USB2000 spectrophotometer with a PX-2 pulsed xenon light source to

373

record reflectance across the avian visual spectrum. All measurements were taken at a

374

45-degree angle to the feather surface. For each species and each sex, we measured all

375

colors we observed in all patches that appeared to be differently colored to the human

376

eye along on 40 measurement points in the ventral and dorsal sides of each specimen.

377

These measurements encompassed all major plumage patches (dorsal: crown, mantle

378

and rump; ventral: throat, breast and belly).

379
380

To quantify the conspicuousness of plumage coloration we used two approaches.

381

First, we calculated euclidean distances between the colors in the belly, rump and

382

crown against the color in the mantle. Birds increase crypsis by displaying

383

countershaded patterns (lighter ventral than dorsal parts) and by matching background

384

contrast (Fig. S1), particularly on their dorsal parts, which are often more exposed to

385

predators 28,37. For this reason, being unable to measure light environments for all

386

species in the field, we assumed that dorsal plumage approximately emulates –or at

387

least more closely resembles– the color of the background where birds live.

388

Therefore, the contrast between the back and the belly, crown and rump colors was

389

used as a proxy for conspicuousness. For this approach, we used an avian visual

390

model38,39 to analyze colors in a tetrahedral color space. We called this variable

391

contrast to the back. Our second approach used a discrimination model which

392

calculates a contrast, for the chromatic and achromatic domain, in avian color space

393

defined by the quantum catches of each receptor type (i.e., cone cell) in the avian

394

retina40. The model assumes that color discrimination in this perceptual space is

395

limited by noise originating in the receptors, and that no visual signal results when

396

stimulus and background differ only in intensity40. We calculated the chromatic (dS)

397

and achromatic (dL) diversity of plumages as follows. First, we measured the

398

contrasts between every pair of points (40) measured on each specimen; second, we

399

calculated the centroid for the chromatic and the achromatic dimension; third, we

400

measured the distance from each point to the centroid for the chromatic and

401

achromatic measures of contrast and we averaged these measurements to have a mean

402

value of the distribution of the contrasts in the chromatic and achromatic dimension of

403

colors (Fig S2). We called these measurements achromatic (dL) and chromatic (dS)

404

diversity of plumage.

407

We used data on song length, syllable variety and vocal performance from a previous

408

study41 as measurements of song elaboration in New World warblers13. We also used

409

existing data on bill size41 and body size42 to study the evolution of morphological

410

traits, compared to the evolution of communication traits.

411
412

As songs increase in either frequency bandwidth or trill rate, the demands of vocal

413

performance increase. Vocal deviation (i.e., the orthogonal distance from the upper-

414

bound regression line between frequency bandwidth and pace of each trill) is strongly

415

related to the energetic demands of vocal performance43,44. Songs far below the

416

regression line (i.e. those with higher values of vocal deviation) are assumed to be less

417

vocally demanding than those closer to the regression line44; thus, we interpret lower

418

values of vocal deviation to reflect greater investment in song production.

419
420

Vegetation structure

421

Vegetation structure was scored using habitat descriptions45 and in accordance with

422

previous work41, as follows: 1 – open, 2 – semiclosed with low vegetation, 3 –

423

semiclosed with high vegetation and 4 – closed. Intermediate scores were used when

424

species used more than one habitat type.

425
426

Analyses

427

To evaluate the transfer hypothesis and the effect of the vegetation density on how

428

transferences are resolved, we used a generalized least square model for comparative

429

phylogenetics (PGLS) implemented in the package caper46. We run PGLS setting

430

contrast to background, chromatic (dS) and achromatic (dL) diversity of plumage as

431

response variables including different set of predictors. First, to test for transfer

432

effects we run models independently with syllable variety, vocal deviation and song

433

length as predictors. Then, to test the effect of habitat on the relationship between

434

visual and acoustical signals, we added vegetation structure as another predictor in the

435

models.

436
437

To examine patterns of evolutionary differentiation in vocal performance and color

438

conspicuousness among lineages of New World warblers, we constructed disparity-

439

through-time (DTT) plots34. DTT plots allow one to examine the accumulation in trait

440

disparity over evolutionary time in a clade by estimating the dispersion of points in

441

multivariate space across time intervals in a phylogeny. This method calculates

442

dissimilarity as the mean square (pair-wise) Manhattan distance among points in trait-

443

space for subclades relative to the variance of the entire clade. Disparity is calculated

444

for individual nodes by moving up the phylogeny from the root of the tree. Relative

445

disparity values close to 0.0 indicate that subclades contain only a small proportion of

446

the total variation and therefore overlap in occupation of phenotypic space is minimal

447

between the different subclades; conversely, relative disparity values close to 1.0

448

indicate extensive phenotypic overlap34. For all the comparative analyses mentioned

449

above, we used a molecular phylogeny of New World warblers based on several

450

mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences25.

Abstract

14

Homeostasis of renewing tissues requires balanced proliferation, differentiation and

15

movement. This is particullary important in the intestinal epithelium where lineage tracing

16

suggests that stochastic differentiation choices are intricately coupled to position. To

17

determine how position is achieved we followed proliferating cells in intestinal organoids

18

and discovered that behaviour of mitotic sisters predicted long-term positioning. Normally,

19

70% of sisters remain neighbours while 30% lose contact separating after cytokinesis. Post-

20

mitotic placements predict differences in positions of sisters later: adjacent sisters reach

21

similar positions; one separating sister remains close to its birthplace, the other moves

22

upward. Computationally modelling crypt dynamics confirmed post-mitotic separation as a

23

mechanism for placement of sisters into different niches. Separation depends on

24

interkinetic nuclear migration, cell size, and asymmetric tethering by a basal process. These

25

processes are altered when Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is mutant and separation is

26

lost. We conclude that post-mitotic placement enables stochastic niche exit and when

27

defective, supports the clonal expansion of Apc mutant cells.

INTRODUCTION

29

Fate choices of proliferating cells are critical for intestinal homeostasis. Lgr5(+) stem cells

30

(SCs) in the intestinal crypt base must be regulated carefully to balance their maintenance

31

with the production of transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors that can specialise. Similarly, exit

32

of TA progenitors from their proliferative niche has to be regulated to produce the

33

appropriate number of post-mitotic, differentiated cells. In the crypt, the position of cells

34

relative to two niches, the stem cell and transit amplifying compartments, reflects their fate

35

(Ritsma et al., 2014). Accordingly, stem and transit amplifying compartments differ in

36

composition. The principal components of the intestinal SC niche are Paneth cells. Together

37

with the surrounding mesenchyme, they provide Notch ligands, EGF and Wnts, which are

38

critical for maintaining SCs and this creates a local Wnt gradient along the intestinal crypt

39

axis (Sato et al., 2011). Displacement of stem cells from Paneth cell contact causes serial

40

dilution of membrane-bound Wnts, contributing to loss of stemness (Farin et al., 2016).

41

Neutral competition for niche access by the 12-16 SCs in the crypt base governs net

42

contraction and expansion of clones, leading to mono-clonal crypts over time (Lopez-Garcia

43

et al., 2010; Snippert et al., 2010). Stem cells near the border of the stem cell niche are

44

more likely to enter the transit-amplifying compartment and lose stemness. Stem cells

45

residing at or near the crypt base are more likely to retain stemness (Ritsma et al., 2014).

46

Traversing the transit amplifying compartment is similarly accompanied by exposure to

47

progressively less Wnt and other growth factors. Exit from this niche causes cell cycle exit.

48

Such direct links between cell positioning and a graded niche signalling also operates in

49

Drosophilla (Reilein et al., 2017). These observations suggest that in intestinal crypts,

50

position, not the segregation of fate-determinants, regulates cell-fate.

interkinetic nuclear migration and basal tethering

Carroll et al.

51

Tissue homeostasis is perturbed in intestinal crypts mutant for key tumour

52

suppressors such as Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), KRAS, p53 and SMAD4. These

53

mutations provide cells with a selective advantage and increase their ability to colonise

54

proliferative niches. Measuring the competitive advantage of cells carrying these mutations

55

using sophisticated lineage tracing experiments demonstrated a competitive advantage over

56

wild-type cells that allowed their preferential retention in the proliferative niche

57

(Vermeulen et al., 2013, Song et al., 2014). The expansion of such mutant clones is thought

58

to underpin field cancerisation, the preconditioning large tissue regions to neoplasia

59

(Slaughter et al., 1953).

60

Our knowledge about cellular mechanisms that control cell positioning in the

61

intestinal epithelium is limited, as is our understanding about how changes in such

62

mechanisms can drive retention of mutant clones. Computational modelling suggests that

63

the magnitude of the Wnt stimulus received at birth is a deciding factor for proliferative fate

64

(Dunn et al., 2016). That suggests that decisions about cell position are set at birth. To test

65

this hypothesis, we investigated daughter cell positioning along the crypt axis in 3D using

66

intestinal organoids.

67
68

RESULTS

69

We measured cell positioning during and after mitosis in intestinal organoids, a widely

70

accepted physiological model of the intestinal epithelium (Sato et al., 2009). They contain

71

epithelial domains that correspond to crypt-villus architecture in vivo, and contain a

72

comparable cellular composition. Cell division (Figure 1A, S1 Figure) and polarity appear

73

identical to those in vivo (Fatehullah et al., 2013), making organoids an ideal model system

Carroll et al.

74

to understand the dynamic behaviour of the intestinal epithelium at temporal and spatial

75

resolution impossible to achieve in tissue in vivo.

76

Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) operates in all intestinal epithelial cells and facilitates

77

placement of mitotic sisters cells into different positions

78

Mitotic cells in the intestinal epithelium are easily distinguished (Figure 1A, S1 Figure).

79

During interphase, nuclei are positioned basally. Upon entering mitosis, interkinetic nuclear

80

migration (INM) causes nuclei to migrate apically towards the centrosome, similar to

81

mitoses in the neuro-epithelium (Spear and Erickson, 2012). During this process, mitotic

82

cells lose their columnar cell shape, become rounded and assume a position in the top half

83

of the epithelial layer. Adjacent interphase cells expand into the basal space that is vacated

84

by the migrating nuclei. Once INM is complete, spindles form and mitosis proceeds. After

85

cytokinesis, newly formed cells move their nuclei basally and eventually assume columnar

86

shape. As mitotic cells round up, their apical surface remains aligned with that of the

87

epithelial layer and they remain attached to the basement membrane by a basal process.

88

Centrosomes are located apically in interphase cells and align laterally with condensed

89

chromosomes during metaphase. These mitotic stages are indistinguishable between tissue

90

and organoids (S1 Figure).

91

Dynamics of INM during mitosis

92

The distinct movement of pre- and post-mitotic nuclei in intestinal epithelium is similar to

93

INM in other tissues, where it has been implicated in cell fate decisions (Spear et al., 2012).

94

For instance, in the neuro-epithelium, INM facilitates differentiation by moving nuclei along

95

apical-basal signalling gradients (Del Bene et al., 2008). In the developing foetal intestinal

96

epithelium, INM has been implicated in the growth of epithelial girth (Grosse et al., 2011).

97

The contribution of INM to intestinal homeostasis has never been examined. We examined

98

how INM affects placement of mitotic sisters by tracking individual cells and their progeny

99

during mitosis.

100

We directly monitored the position of mother and daughters during mitosis and

101

after cytokinesis using live imaging of intestinal organoids expressing Histone2B-GFP (H2B-

102

GFP). All nuclei in organoids derived from H2B-GFP mice robustly express GFP 24 hours

103

after exposure to doxycycline allowing nuclear position to be used as a surrogate for cell

104

position. (Figure 1B, C, S1 Movie) (Foudi et al., 2009). Measuring cell position in organoids

105

required tracking cells in three-dimensional (3D) space. Techniques for accurately tracking

106

cells in 3D are limited and we were unable to reliably track GFP(+) nuclei using automated

107

methods. Therefore, daughter cell behaviour was recorded manually by tracking cells using

108

Imaris (Bitplane) (Figure 1D).

109

Recordings revealed novel dynamic data about cell behaviour during mitosis. Mitosis

110

lasted approximately 60 minutes. Prophase was characterised by nuclear condensation and

111

INM, followed by rapid formation of the metaphase plate. After spindle alignment and

112

cytokinesis, both daughters slowly migrate basally until their nuclei align with adjacent

113

interphase cells (Figure 1E). During interphase, nuclei moved approximately 25Îźm/hour in

114

crypts, which increased to 60Îźm/hour during INM. Speed during basal cell movement was

115

comparable to that in interphase suggesting that INM is an active process and that basal

116

movement is passive (Figure 1F). The unique arrangement of microtubule bundles above

117

the nucleus in early mitosis suggests that INM involves microtubules (S1 Figure).

Carroll et al.

118

Daughter cells either remain adjacent or are separated from one another after mitosis

119

Tracking mitotic cells revealed two distinct outcomes for mitotic sisters. They either remain

120

adjacent (6.0 +/-1.2Îźm apart) and become neighbours (Figure 2A, S2 Movie), or they

121

separate (12.9 +/- 2.8Îźm apart) and exchange neighbours (Figure 2B, S3 Movie). Rendering

122

mitoses in 4D confirmed their separation by a neighbouring cell (Figure 2C, S4 Movie).

123

Importantly, we observed similar mitoses in vivo with one sister positioned significantly

124

displaced from the other by neighbouring cells (Figure 2D). This data suggests that post-

125

mitotic separation occurs in native tissue and in organoids.

126

To determine when mitotic sisters separate, we measured when neighbouring cells

127

first appeared between them. Specifically, we measured the H2B-intensity across the line

128

connecting the centre of sister nuclei to visualise nuclear boundaries (Figure 2E). For

129

adjacent sisters, the line-intensity profile was unchanged over time indicating that the two

130

nuclei remained in close proximity.

131

appeared between the peaks representing each sister, indicating the insertion of a

132

neighbouring cell between them. Insertion of neighbours occurred 72-120 minutes after

133

cytokinesis, indicating that displacement occurred during basal cell movement (Figure 2E).

134

Live-imaging of the mitochondrial network using Mitotracker clearly showed distinct cells

135

between mitotic sisters, further confirming their physical separation (Figure 2F, S5 Movie).

In post-mitotic separations, an additional peak

136

We found other situations also favoured separation. Separation could be facilitated

137

by the movement of daughters of other mitoses in the immediate vicinity (S2 Figure, S6

138

Movie). Furthermore, separation was favoured when mitoses occurred next to Paneth cells.

139

Paneth cells are more adherent and stiffer (Langlands et al., 2016) and this could force one

141

Apc mutation alters placement of daughter cells

142

APC is required for normal intestinal homeostasis and mutations in Apc are common to

143

most tumours in the colon (Fearnhead et al., 2001). The APC protein functions as a scaffold

144

in Wnt signalling (McCartney and NĂ¤thke, 2008). It contributes to spindle orientation

145

(Yamashita et al., 2003, Quyn et al., 2010), and cell migration along the crypt-villus axis

146

(Nelson and Nathke, 2013). Lineage tracing and computational modelling has demonstrated

147

that Apc mutations increase the retention of cells in intestinal crypts (Vermeulen et al.,

148

2013, Song et al., 2014). To determine if changes in the positioning of mitotic sisters could

149

explain these observations we isolated organoids derived from Apc heterozygous mice

150

(ApcMin/+). These organoids are initially indistinguishable from wild-type organoids

151

(Fatehullah et al., 2013) but transform into spherical, cyst-like structures (Figure 3A)

152

containing cells that have undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (ApcMin/Min) (Germann et

153

al., 2014). Mitoses appeared normal in ApcMin/+ organoids, however, in ApcMin/Min organoids,

154

abnormal mitoses with multipolar spindles and mitotic slippage were frequently observed

155

(S3 Figure), similar to cultured cells which lack APC (Dikovskaya et al., 2007). We compared

156

the incidence of the two types of cell placements in wild-type and ApcMin/+ mice and in

157

ApcMin/Min organoids (S1 Movie).

158

In wild-type epithelium, ca. 30% of daughter cells separated whilst ca. 70% remained

159

adjacent (Figure 3B). Separation was mainly associated with movement of neighbouring

160

interphase cells during basal cell movement (75.1% +/- 14.8% of cases). Separation by

161

surrounding mitotic progeny was less common (29.5% +/-21.6% of cases). The frequency of

162

the two mitotic types was equal in the stem and transit amplifying compartments,

163

suggesting that mitotic outcome is independent of cell position and type and can occur in

any cycling cell that undergoes INM (Figure 3C). To further confirm that mitotic separation

165

is not specific to stem cells, we measured mitotic outcome in organoids treated with the

166

GSK-3Î˛ inhibitor, Chir99021, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, which increases the

167

number of Lgr5(+) stem cells in the crypt (Yin et al., 2014). Treatment with Chir99021 and

168

valproic acid did not significantly change post-mitotic separation of sisters (S4 Figure),

169

suggesting that the occurrence of post-mitotic separation is similar in all dividing cells along

170

the crypt axis.

171

In ApcMin/+ organoids there was a significant reduction in the frequency of post-

172

mitotic separations. Sisters never separated in ApcMin/Min organoids (Figure 3B).

173

suggests that Apc mutant sisters are more likely to remain adjacent after division. There

174

was also a significant overall reduction in cell movement between wild-type and ApcMin/+

175

epithelial cells, including nuclear speed during INM (Figure 3D), suggesting that cells remain

176

adjacent because of reduced cell movement. Loss of post-mitotic separation was also

177

induced by long-term treatment of organoids with high concentrations of Chir99021. This

178

treatment caused organoids to grow as cysts, similar to ApcMin/Min organoids (S5 Figure). This

179

suggests that hyperactive Wnt signalling induced either by Apc mutation or by GSK-3Î˛

180

inhibition can alter the frequency of post-mitotic separation, although it is possible that this

181

is an indirect consequence of the changes in cells size and shape (see below).

Post-mitotic separation of daughter cells directs niche exit

183

The two types of placements of mitotic sisters we discovered led to the hypothesis

184

that post-mitotic separation allows differential exit of sisters from proliferative

compartments. For instance, separation of stem cell daughters may increase the probability

186

for one daughter to remain in the stem cell niche compared to the other. Similarly, in the

187

transit-amplifying compartment, post-mitotic separation could make it more likely for one

188

daughter to remain in the proliferative compartment and the other to exit and terminally

189

differentiate. To test this idea, we measured the distance of mitotic sisters from their

190

starting positions and from each other after their birth. Shortly after cytokinesis, after both

191

daughters had assumed their interphase position, regardless of mitosis type, one sister

192

always remained near its starting position, whereas the other moved upward (Figure 4A, B).

193

At later times (up to 35 hours after mitosis), differences between sisters were accentuated.

194

If sisters had separated, one always remained close to its starting position while the other

195

was displaced significantly upwards.

196

displaced upwards (Figure 4A, B). Thus the initial difference in distance between sisters in

197

the two types of mitoses was amplified over time, consistent with the idea that different

198

placement of mitotic sisters can produce different outcomes for cell positioning.

In contrast, adjacently placed sisters were both

199

To provide additional evidence for this idea we used a previously established

200

computational 3D model of intestinal crypts (Dunn et al., 2016) and asked whether post-

201

mitotic separation could promote heterogeneous position/fate. To compare modelling

202

results to our experimental data, simulations were performed with daughters placed

203

adjacent to each other (as in previous computational models) or separated by a factor larger

204

than a typical cell diameter. Simulations were performed using parameters derived from

205

the primary data (materials and methods). These simulations confirmed that post-mitotic

206

separation often led to one daughter being retained close to its point of birth whilst the

207

other displaced upward (Figure 4C). There was a significant difference between the

208

separation velocities between the two mitotic subtypes, indicating that daughters that

209

initially separated moved apart much faster than those born adjacent (Figure 4D, E).

interkinetic nuclear migration and basal tethering

Carroll et al.

210

To test whether post-mitotic separation influences the number of heterogeneous

211

cell pairs, we imposed a crypt-specific boundary separating a proliferative region from a

212

non-proliferative region. Heterogeneous pairs are produced when one daughter is retained

213

in the proliferative boundary and the other exits. Consistent with our experimental results,

214

simulations showed that separation led to more heterogeneous pairs than adjacent

215

placements (Figure 4F). The same results were produced for thresholds representing the

216

TA/Differentiated SC/TA boundaries, similar to other reports (Vermeulen et al., 2013, Song

217

et al., 2014).

218

heterogeneous pairs (Figure 4G). Together, these data suggest that post-mitotic separation

219

could enhance divergent daughter fate by promoting the exit of one daughter from a niche

220

whilst allowing the other to remain.

221

Mechanisms for post-mitotic separation

A greater separation distance at birth led to a higher number of

222

A number of mechanisms may be involved in post-mitotic separation. For instance,

223

spindle orientation could direct placement of sisters, supported by the different types of

224

spindle alignment we previously discovered in intestinal tissue (Quyn et al., 2010). Position

225

and location of mitotic sisters is likely affected by spindle orientation. To understand how

226

mitotic placement related to spindle orientation, we measured spindle alignment in

227

organoids. Consistent with previous data in whole tissue, we observed spindle orientation

228

bias in the stem cell compartment of wild-type organoids where cells more readily oriented

229

their spindles perpendicularly to the apical surface. There were no perpendicularly oriented

230

spindles in the stem cell compartment in ApcMin/+ organoids (S3 Figure). This is consistent

231

with the idea that separating sisters can result from mitoses with perpendicularly aligned

232

mitotic spindles.

However, perpendicular spindle alignment was less frequent than

233

separating sisters, indicating that additional processes are involved and that spindle

234

orientation is not a reliable measure of post-mitotic separation.

235

Basal tethering of daughter cells contributes to post-mitotic separation and is altered in

236

Apc mutant organoids

237

Another mechanism that may affect placement of daughters involves the basal process that

238

tethers mitotic cells to the basement membrane (Fleming et al., 2007). This process is

239

formed during INM and persists throughout metaphase. The basal process is rich in F-Actin

240

and is tethered at the basement membrane by Î˛4-Integrin (Figure 5A). Tethering of

241

daughter cells after cytokinesis and during basal cell movement provides a direct means to

242

guide daughters. Asymmetric tethering of mitotic cells has been shown to coincide with the

243

segregation of planar cell polarity markers in the colonic epithelium (Bellis et al., 2012).

244

To determine whether asymmetric tethering of sisters operated in organoids and

245

contributed to their placement, we measured the position of basal processes relative to

prospective daughters.

tethering of daughters and adjacent cell placement, whereas asymmetric processes

255

predicted daughter separation (Figure 5C).

256

The proportion of symmetrically and asymmetrically placed basal processes differed

257

between the stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments. In the latter, the proportion of

258

asymmetric basal processes was ca. 30%, similar to the proportion of separating mitotic

261

daughter cell closer to the crypt base, predicting that the untethered daughter was most

262

likely to be displaced upwards. Asymmetrical basal process placement was a feature of

263

mitotic cells with perpendicularly aligned spindles, suggesting that spindle orientation and

264

basal process placement are linked (S3 Figure). Live imaging suggested that the basal

265

process guides basal cell movement. The tethered daughter migrated basally to assume the

266

interphase position of the mother, whilst the untethered daughter moved freely and

267

allowed sister separation. This was particularly obvious when a daughter required multiple

268

attempts to reintegrate into the epithelium (Figure 5E; S8 Movie). In ApcMin/+ intestinal

269

organoids fewer processes were placed asymmetrically, consistent with the significantly

270

reduced frequency of separating sisters in ApcMin/+ organoids (Figure 5D). We propose that

271

asymmetric processes facilitate the displacement of one daughter cell from the niche by

272

allowing it to separate from its sister, rather than simply aiding in their retention (Bellis et

273

al., 2012). To provide evidence for this hypothesis, we performed live imaging of H2B-GFP

274

organoids treated with SiR-Actin (Lukinavicius, G. et al., 2014). As expected, daughter

275

separation correlated with asymmetric segregation of the basal process (Figure 5F, S9

In both regions, asymmetrically positioned processes tended to localise to the

277

Apc loss and hyperactive Wnt signalling restrict separation of sisters by inhibiting INM and

278

changing cell size and morphology

279

We did not detect sister cell separation In ApcMin/Min organoids. Instead, metaphases

280

usually lay in the plane of the epithelium in line with interphase nuclei and only had short

281

compressed basal processes which were difficult to visualise (Figure 6A). In addition, cell

282

morphology was altered and the distance between apical and basal surfaces was

283

significantly reduced (ca. 25%) compared to wild-type or ApcMin/+ cells (Figure 6A). To

284

determine whether this was due to changes in cell shape or overall cell size, we measured

285

the volume of isolated, single cells from wild-type, ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/Min organoids using

286

flow cytometry. There was no significant difference between wild-type and ApcMin/+ but cell

287

size in ApcMin/Min organoids was reduced by 25%, indicating that a smaller cell volume was

288

responsible for the reduced cell height (Figure 6B). This suggests that in cells lacking wild-

289

type Apc, space restriction causes a reduction in apical-basal distance to prevent INM and

290

restrict basal process formation, preventing post-mitotic separation.

291

To directly determine if and how INM was altered in ApcMin/Min organoids, we first

292

measured the distance of mitotic nuclei relative to the basal membrane of the epithelial

293

layer in wild-type, ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/Min organoids. The basal reference was established as

294

the plane formed between neighbouring cells proximal to the mitotic/daughter cells (S5

295

296

D). There was no significant difference in distance covered during INM between wild-type

297

and ApcMin/+ cells (Figure 6C, D). However, the speed of nuclei during INM was significantly

298

reduced in ApcMin/+ cells suggesting that they require longer to reach the apical region

and/or spend less time there (Figure 3D). As expected, in ApcMin/Min organoids there was no

300

apical displacement and all daughters were placed adjacently. Similar results were achieved

301

in organoids chronically treated with Chir99021 to hyper-activate Wnt signalling (S5 Figure).

302

We also observed mitoses in ApcMin/+ organoids that exhibited no INM. One possible

303

explanation is that some cells in ApcMin/+ organoids had already undergone LOH, which may

304

dramatically reduce INM. Together, these data show that INM is important for the ability of

305

sisters to separate (Figure 6C, D).

306

To corroborate these observations in vivo, we compared the morphology of

307

interphase and mitotic cells in normal and transformed tissue isolated from a familial

308

adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient (Figure 6E). We detected a striking morphological

309

change in cells from dysplastic regions. In contrast to ApcMin/Min organoids, which displayed

310

greatly reduced apical-basal distance, we detected significant lateral compression of cells in

311

the human tissue samples (Figure 6F, G) that correlated with the pseudo-stratification

312

caused by âpile-upsâ of cells along the crypt-villus axis (Figure 6E). This lateral compression

313

likely restricts the ability of nuclei to undergo INM and reach the apical surface and

314

separate. The resulting decrease in post-mitotic separation may contribute to the observed

315

pseudo-stratification and also promote cell overcrowding in crypts.

316
317

DISCUSSION

318

Where a cell is born is linked to its identity. In this study, we show that daughter cells

319

can separate immediately after cytokinesis and assume increasingly diverging positions over

320

time (Figure 7). This means that one sister is more likely to exit a compartment where it was

321

born than the other. For stem cells, this means that one sister is more likely to differentiate

322

into a progenitor. For transit-amplifying cells, it means that one sister is more likely to exit

323

the proliferative niche of the transit-amplifying compartment and become post-mitotic. For

324

simple columnar epithelia, it is possible that post-mitotic separation provides a cellular

325

mechanism for the neutral drift that governs stem cell population dynamics. All intestinal

326

cells have a similar probability of undergoing post-mitotic separation, allowing one daughter

327

to remain in its current niche position and the other to leave. It is unlikely that post-mitotic

328

separation always produces a heterogeneous cell pair, as this would only readily occur near

329

a niche boundary. However, this mechanism could influence overall homeostasis and

330

protect stem cell number by slowing neutral drift i.e. ensuring that one daughter remains

331

close to its birth place, making it more likely to remain in a proliferative niche.

332

Reduced post-mitotic separation in Apc mutant cells provides an explanation for

333

their increased probability to colonise a niche (Vermeulen et al., 2013, Baker et al., 2014).

334

Neither mutant sister is likely to be displaced from its birthplace, instead, they remain in

335

close proximity to each other. Together with their well characterised decreased migration,

336

which we confirmed in organoids (Figure 4), this could significantly decrease the number of

337

Apc mutant cells exiting proliferative compartments (Nelson et al., 2012). As a result, in Apc

338

mutant epithelia, many sisters would remain in a proliferative niche, resulting in increased

339

number of proliferating cells. This explains the increased number of cells in the crypt base

340

of ApcMin/+ tissue (Quyn et al., 2010). A reduction in post-mitotic separation and decreased

341

migration may confer on Apc mutant cells the competitive advantage that causes their

342

preferred niche retention (Figure 4) (Nelson et al., 2012). Changes in the positioning of wild

343

type and Apc mutant cells could also be responsible for the measurable differences in

344

histologically normal appearing ApcMin/+ tissue. The decrease in the regularity of crypt shape

345

and packing that is detectable by high resolution optical imaging and high frequency

346

ultrasound could reflect altered post-mitotic placement of cells and could be caused by

347

increased retention of expanding clones of ApcMin/Min mutant cells in ApcMin/+ tissue

348

(Fatehullah et al., 2016a)

349

Post-mitotic placement is likely to contribute to crypt fission, the process that

350

produces two daughter crypts and is responsible for elongation of intestinal tract

351

(Humphries and Wright, 2008). Initiation of crypt fission involves the formation of a cluster

352

of stem cells at the crypt base, which marks the point of bifurcation (Langlands et al., 2016).

353

Dynamic post-mitotic rearrangements of daughters could explain how these clusters form.

354

We found that in many cases, mitoses next to Paneth cells resulted in separating sisters.

355

The tight packing at the crypt base and the larger size and stiffness of Paneth cells means

356

that once mitotic daughters of a dividing stem cell at the crypt base remain adjacent to each

357

other, it is increasingly difficult for daughters of subsequent divisions to separate due to the

358

physical constraint generated. This could cause the initial clustering of Lgr5+ cells marking

359

the initiation of fission.

360

Post-mitotic separation is facilitated by INM and the ability to asymmetrically

361

segregate basal processes. A role for APC in INM as suggested by our data is consistent with

362

findings in neuro-epithelia where loss of Apc disrupts INM (Ivaniutsin et al., 2009). In the

363

neuro-epithelium, INM relies on microtubules for nuclear movement and actomyosin

364

activity for cell rounding (Spear and Erickson, 2012, Xie et al., 2007). In the intestinal

365

epithelium, INM may also involve microtubules. Specifically, the apical-basal microtubule

366

scaffold may facilitate the nuclear movement during INM (S1 Figure). APC regulates both

367

microtubules and actin (NĂ¤thke et al., 1996, Zumbrunn et al., 2001, Okada et al., 2010) and

368

cytoskeletal defects resulting from Apc mutation could compromise the function of

369

microtubule bundles reducing the efficiency of INM and sister separation. Indeed, the

Carroll et al.

370

number of microtubules in large parallel arrays is significantly reduced in ApcMin/+ cells

371

(Mogensen et al., 2002). Disruption of the microtubule scaffold may also cause the defects

372

in cell volume and height observed in ApcMin/Min cells consistent with recent reports

373

suggesting that disruptions of the apical-basal orientation of microtubules can reduce cell

374

height (Toya et al., 2016).

375

The formation and position of the basal process underlies post-mitotic separation.

376

Unlike previous reports in the colon (Bellis et al., 2012), we demonstrate that asymmetric

377

process localisation actively promotes neighbour exchange and niche exit. How basal

378

processes form is unclear, whether as a cause or a consequence of mitosis. In Apc mutant

379

cells, as in the colon (Bellis et al., 2012), processes are usually symmetrically placed and they

380

form more slowly. The increased time required to complete INM in Apc mutant cells (Figure

381

4) may be responsible, by reducing the time available to establish an asymmetric process.

382

Cell morphology is also important for post-mitotic separation. Cells in highly

383

abnormal regions of FAP tissue were significantly compressed laterally, suggesting that

384

mutant cells are smaller and/or softer than wild-type cells. There is growing evidence that

385

malignant cells are softer than untransformed cells (Plodinec et al., 2012). Reduced cell

386

volume could cause both lateral and/or apical-basal compression and restrict nuclear

387

movement and impair INM. This would cause mutant cells in vivo to remain close to their

388

sisters and colonise a niche more successfully than wild-type cells. Altered cell morphology

389

is evident in human intestinal organoids after Apc depletion and also seen with mutations in

390

KRas, P53 or SMAD4 (Drost et al., 2015), suggesting that post-mitotic separation can be

391

compromised by other contributing mutations which affect cell morphology.

Tissue Preparation: Mouse Small Intestine

423

Adult mouse small-intestine was washed briefly in PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 3 hours at

424

4Â°C. Intestine was cut into 2x2cm2 pieces and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C. The tissue

425

was embedded in 3% low melting temperature agarose and sectioned at 200Âľm intervals

426

using a Vibratome (Leica). Cut sections were washed in PBS and permeabilized for 2 hours

Spindle Angle measurements

490

Spindle orientation was measured using image stacks and analysed using the Imaris imaging

491

software (Bitplane). Surfaces of the Hoechst, g-tubulin and phalloidin signals were rendered

492

using the isosurface tool. Similar to a report in the mouse colon (Bellis et al., 2012), we used

493

two angles to represent spindle orientation: 1) relative to the crypt axis (Axial angle) and 2)

494

relative to the apical surface (Apical angle). The apical surface was defined using the F-actin

495

signal at the lumenal surface. To calculate angles, three sets of measurement points were

496

manually placed in 3D:

497

(1) Two points defining the two centrosomes. The connection between them represents the

498

spindle axis.

499

(2) Two points placed at either end of the crypt so that the axis formed between them is

500

representative of the crypt axis.

501

(3) Three points placed on the rendered phalloidin surface to represent the cells apical

502

surface.

503

Axial angles are the angles between the spindle and crypt-axis. The Apical angle is calculated

504

using the 3 measurement points to determine the normal surface vector to the apical plane.

505

The Axial angle between this defined apical surface and the spindle axis was calculated as

INM Measurements

533

Apical and basal interkinetic nuclear migration was measured by determining the distance

534

between the nucleus and the plane of the epithelium. The plane of the epithelium is defined

535

as the plane formed between the neighbours of the query nucleus:

540

Distance measurements were calculated for 10 planes encompassing each permutation of

541

neighbouring cells. The average distance for these 10 planes was taken as the

542

representative distance of the query cell in reference to the plane of the epithelium in which

543

it originated. This was to account for variability induced by the curvature within the

544

organoid branches.

546

Stem cell and transit amplifying compartments were defined based on the average position

547

of Lgr5+ cells along the crypt-villus axis measured in Lgr5-GFP organoids (S5 Figure). As Lgr5

548

can also be expressed in the early TA compartment (Quyn et al., 2010), we conservatively

defined the SC compartment based on the average position of Lgr5(+) cells rather than the

Cell position was determined by placing a measurement point in the centre of each nucleus.

Time-lapse analysis and scoring

561

Time-lapse image stacks were analysed manually using Imaris (Bitplane). All mitotic events

562

were marked using the â3D spots functionâ. Time-point 0 was denoted as the time-point

563

immediately before cytokinesis. Each mitotic daughter cell was tracked until its death,

564

subsequent division, or exit from the imaging window. If daughter cells were separated by a

565

neighbouring nucleus after basal INM (at 120 minutes) they were scored as separated.

566

Displacement from the âpoint of birthâ was calculated as the change in distance between the

567

start (mitotic mother) and end position of a daughter, divided by the time interval.

568

Daughter 1 was always classified as the daughter closest to the base of the crypt.

INM measurement

571

We determined the distance covered by nuclei during INM by measuring the distance of the

572

mitotic nucleus to a defined basal reference plane. The basal reference was defined as the

573

plane formed by neighbouring interphase cells. The co-ordinates of 5 neighbouring nuclei

574

most proximal to the mitotic cell were determined. These interphase cells often did not

575

form a simple plane due to curvature of the epithelial sheet. To account for the shape, we

576

calculated the nearest distance from the position of the mitotic cell to the planes formed by

577

combinations of each of three nuclei for the 5 neighbours. The average distance from these

578

(10) planes was then used as the estimated apical distance travelled during INM (S5 Figure).

Please refer to supplementary information for further details.

Cell height measurement

582

Apical-basal distance was measured as the distance between the apical and basal surfaces

583

using Imaris. Distances were calculated in the optical section at the centre of the chosen

584

cell by recording one 3D measurement point in the middle of the apical and one in the

585

middle of the basal surface. The distance between these points was the apical-basal

distance.

Multicellular Computational Model

597

All simulations were undertaken in the CHASTE framework (Mirams et al., 2013). We

598

extended the model presented in (Dunn et al., 2016) to permit variable separation of cells

599

after division. In summary, cells are represented by their centres, which are free to move

600

on a surface (in 3 dimensional space) that is defined using measured crypt geometry. Cells

601

move because of forces exerted on them due to compression of, and by, neighbouring cells.

602

We are using the optimal model identified in Dunn et al., 2016, Model 6. In this model cells

603

divide after a uniformly distributed time that depends on the level of Wnt (imposed as a

604

linear gradient) experienced when the parent cell divided.

605

compressed beyond a given threshold they pause in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. All

606

parameters used are as described in Dunn et al., 2016. As in previous three-dimensional

607

models of the crypt (Dunn et al., 2016, Dunn et al., 2013), cell division occurs in a direction

608

uniformly drawn from the sphere surrounding the centre of the dividing cell. Daughter cells

609

are placed at a specified distance from one another. Previously, in all existing models, this

610

distance is chosen so daughter cells are adjacent to each other. We modified this parameter

611

so that two thirds of all cell divisions resulted in the daughter cells being placed next to each

612

other (a separation of 1 cell diameter), the remaining third resulted in the daughter cells

613

being separated by đ cell diameters. We vary this parameter between 0 and 3 to measure

614

the effects on separation of cells in the virtual crypt.

Additionally, if cells are

Supplemental Information

616

We provide supplemental information describing mitosis in intestinal epithelium and organoids,

617

showing that they are similar and suggest that INM requires microtubules (S1 Figure). In addition to

618

asymmetric basal tethering, post-mitotic separation appears to be influenced by the proximity of

619

other mitotic daughters and by proximity to Paneth cells which are less mobile (S2 Figure). We also

620

show that asymmetric tethering and spindle orientation are partially linked and that this is altered in

621

Apc mutant tissue (S3 Figure). We show that disruption of INM can also be induced by hyper-

622

activation of Wnt (S4 Figure). We provide figures demonstrating our definition of the stem and

623

transit amplifying compartments and an illustration of how INM was measured (S5 Figure).

Confocal LSM imaging of an induced wild-type H2B-GFP organoid showing manual tracking of a

652

mitotic cell and its progeny undergoing post-mitotic separation. In this example, the daughters of

653

this mitosis are displaced in proximity to a Paneth cell (recognisable by the large space with no

654

nuclei). This movie was used in stills in S2 figure.

655

S8 Movie â Delayed Daughter Cell Insertion

656

Confocal LSM imaging of an induced wild-type H2B-GFP organoid showing manual tracking of a

657

mitotic cell and its progeny undergoing post-mitotic separation. In this example the left most

658

daughter takes two attempts to reassume its interphase position, whilst the other is displaced. This

659

movie was used for stills in Figure 5E.

660

S9 Movie â Asymmetric process segregation underlies post-mitotic separation

661

Confocal LSM imaging of an induced wild-type H2B-GFP organoid treated with SiR-Actin. The movie

662

shows a mitotic cell undergoing post-mitotic separation in which one daughter retains the basal

663

process. The two daughters (white spheres) are separated by a neighbour after reinsertion.

Mitotic cells were tracked manually for 60 minutes prior to cytokinesis and daughters for a
further 120 minutes. Two types of mitotic types were revealed: (A) Daughter cells
positioned adjacent or (B) which separated after mitosis. Displayed are 3D projections (top
panels) and 2D sections through an organoid branch. Metaphase (green) and daughters
(red/blue) are highlighted. Representative tracks show the distance of the mitotic mother
(black line) and daughters (red/blue lines) from the original starting position. (P)rophase,
(M)etaphase, (C)ytokinesis, interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), and basal cell movement
(BM) are indicated. Distances between adjacently placed daughters (grey dashed line) are â¤
1 nuclear width (6Îźm) whereas distances between separating daughters is greater.

a post-mitotic separation event. Displayed are rotated views of cells and their direct
neighbours at time-points encompassing INM, cytokinesis and after separation (120 minutes
after cytokinesis).
(D) Daughter separation occurs in vivo. Representative image of daughters at a crypt base.
Samples were stained with Hoechst (blue) and phalloidin (red). Highlighted are two
prospective daughters (white stars) displayed in X-Y and X-Y-Z views (left panels). Surface
rendering (right panels) highlights cell-cell boundaries and neighbouring cell nuclei.
(E) H2B-GFP line-intensity profiles were created along a line connecting the centres of sister
nuclei at indicated times after cytokinesis (=Time 0). Reference images (3D projections) are
displayed. Please note that the scaling for the x-axis, indicating distance, changes in the
right-hand panel to accommodate the increased space between the separating daughters.
(F) Individual frames of an H2B-GFP organoid stained with Mitotracker highlighting a mitotic
cell whose daughters separate shortly after mitosis. Time points reflecting metaphase,
cytokinesis and after return of daughters to their interphase position (reinsertion) are
shown. A line-intensity profile was generated between marked daughters (A and B) during
cytokinesis and after âinsertionâ. After reinsertion, a discrete H2B-GFP peak was detected
that correspond to the neighbouring cell that displaces the two daughters (red arrow). The
neighbouring cell has two distinct Mitotracker peaks on either side of its H2B-GFP signal
(black arrows).

mitoses; ApcMin/+, N=3, 227 mitoses, ApcMin/Min, N=7, 34 mitoses; T-test). Relative frequency
of each type of mitosis was determined per organoid and averaged for replicate organoids.
There was a significant difference between the number of adjacent and separating
daughters between wild-type, ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/Min organoids (T-test, p<0.0001).

(C) Mitotic cell position was determined relative to the crypt base for wild-type and ApcMin/+
organoids. The frequency of each mitosis type along the crypt-villus axis was measured for 3
organoids. The stem cell (SC) and transit amplifying (TA) compartments are marked as

(A) Representative images show examples of the long-term behaviour of daughter cells
following separate or adjacent placement. An overlay of the track of daughters (Daughter 1,
red; Daughter 2, blue) reveals the total displacement over the time course (white arrow).

(B) Daughter cell position from the crypt base was measured after reinsertion into the
epithelium (~2 hours) and at the final position able to be recorded (5-35 hours).
Displacement (movement of each daughter from the crypt base over time) was calculated
for each daughter pair. Daughter 1 was defined as the daughter closest to the crypt base.
Values were calculated for separating (Apart, N = 28) or adjacent (Together, N = 84; T-test,
p<0.001) sisters.

(C) Simulation results: representative images showing daughters initially placed adjacent to
each other (red) and placed apart by 1 cell diameter (blue). Snapshots shown represent
these situations immediately after mitosis and 12 hours later (right hand panels).

(D). Simulation results show the distribution of cell separation as a function of time since
birth. Results are shown for a homogenous population (left) of cell divisions where
daughter cells are placed adjacent to each other (i.e. đ = 0 for all divisions), and for a
heterogeneous population (right) of cell divisions where đ = 0 for two thirds of divisions
(red) and đ = 1 for the remaining third (blue). The mean separation (solid line) and
standard deviation (shaded region) is displayed. Linear fits to the distribution (from 5-15
hours) are represented by dotted lines.

(E) Simulation results for the effect of initial cell placement on separation velocity. For each
separation, a heterogeneous population of divisions (two thirds with đ = 0 and a third
with đ â  0) is simulated and the corresponding separations (as shown in (D)) are calculated,
and the distribution of values recorded. The separation velocity is calculated by taking the
gradient of the linear fit to the mean of this distribution for both populations of divisions
(adjacent in red and separated in blue). Cells placed initially further apart will separate
more quickly than those placed together.

(F) Simulation results for the proportion of cell divisions that produce cells in different
niches (i.e one cell remains in the proliferative compartment while the other leaves) for
simulations shown in (D). Results are shown for a homogenous population (left) of cell
divisions where all daughter cells are placed adjacent to each other (i.e. đ = 0 for all
divisions) and for a heterogeneous population (right) of cell divisions where đ = 0 for two
thirds of divisions (red) and đ = 1 for the remaining third (blue). Constant fits to these
distributions (using data for all ages) are denoted by dotted lines.

914

(G) Simulation results showing how the average proportion of cell pairs with different
positions (using the constant fit from (F)) depends on the initial separation. The same
simulations were used as in (E). Increasing separation leads to a larger proportion of cell
pairs in different positions.

(A) 3D projections of mitotic cells in organoids and whole tissue reveal the basal process

(B) 3D projection of a mitotic cell aligned in metaphase shows the position of its basal
process (white arrow), centrosomes (green), nucleus (blue), and mitotic cleavage plane.
Symmetric or asymmetric process inheritance was scored based on its placement relative to
each centrosome. Accordingly, basal processes could be localised to the cell closer to the
crypt base (âbottomâ), equidistant from each centrosome (âmiddleâ), or furthest from the
crypt base (âtopâ). In the displayed X-Y sections, views were orientated with the crypt base
towards the bottom in each image.

(C) Process inheritance was scored by visual inspection of the position of basal processes
relative to the mitotic cell in 3D. Two examples of mitotic cells are shown, one with
asymmetric and one with symmetric process placement (see also S3 Figure). 3D surface
rendering shows the position of the basal process.

(D) Process segregation was scored by measuring the distance between the attachment
point of the basal process and the centrosome of each prospective daughter in the stem
cell- and transit-amplifying compartments of wild-type (N=12 organoids, N = 68 mitoses)
and ApcMin/+ (N=20 organoids, N = 61 mitoses) organoids. Frequencies are displayed as the
average percentage of each outcome per organoid. The frequency is displayed as a
percentage of the mitotic events in each compartment. There was a significant reduction in
the number of asymmetrically localised basal processes in the stem cell compartment in
ApcMin/+organoids compared to the stem cell compartment in wild-type organoids (T-test
***P<0.001). Processes were scored manually and defined as asymmetric if significantly
displaced from the cleavage furrow. To confirm manual scoring, process displacement was
calculated for all scored asymmetric and symmetric processes. Displacement was defined as
the difference between the distances from the process to each centrosome (right hand
panel). Data is displayed as mean +/- SEM. Process displacement in mitoses scored as
asymmetric was significantly more common than in symmetric mitoses (T-Test
****p<0.0001).

whose daughters undergo post-mitotic separation. Displayed are time points encompassing
metaphase (0 min), cytokinesis (9-12 min) and the two daughters during reinsertion (18-27
min), when they become separated by a neighbour (black stars). An asymmetric process
(white/red arrows) is located closer to daughter 1 on one side of the putative cleavage
furrow. The apical surface is denoted by the thick dashed line.

isolated wild-type, ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/Min cells using flow cytometry. The median forward
scatter was determined from 3 independent organoid samples for each genotype and

In untransformed intestinal epithelia, normal tissue architecture is maintained. During
mitosis, cells undergo interkinetic nuclear migration, characterised by the apical movement
of nuclei as the cell rounds up. This permits daughter cells to remain proximal or to become
displaced from one another by neighbouring cells. Displacement promotes retention of a
cell at its birthplace and allows the other to exit the niche. This displacement is facilitated by
INM and the asymmetric segregation of the basal process. After mutation of one Apc allele
(ApcMin/+), mitoses become biased towards adjacent placement and migrate slower,
facilitating niche retention. Upon loss of heterozygosity (ApcMin/Min), all cells lose the
capacity for separation due to reduced cell size and inhibited INM. As a result, symmetrical
cyst growth could be promoted, promoting altered tissue architecture.

(B) Confocal sections (X-Y) of mitotic stages visualised in intestinal crypts of whole tissue and
organoids. Interphase cells maintain basally positioned nuclei. During mitosis the apical cell
surface remains aligned with neighbouring cells. Chromatin condensation occurs during
prophase and the nucleus is displaced apically. During INM, the rounded mitotic cell remains
attached to the basal membrane by a basal process (BP). After alignment with the apical
surface the metaphase plate forms apically and is directly followed by anaphase in which
cells have two clear sets of sister chromatids.

rounded up mitotic cells. Indicated cells are not differentiated due to the detectable pair of
centrosomes (i and ii). The apical surface is marked by the red dashed line.

(A) Separation of daughters is enhanced by movement of neighbouring mitotic cells.
Displayed are 3D projections of the movements of the progeny of a mitotic cell (Original

green; Mitosis 3; blue). Time 0 marks metaphase of the original mitotic cell.
(B) i)Live imaging of a wild-type H2B-GFP organoid. A Paneth cell can be clearly identified
based on morphology and distribution of neighbouring nuclei (dashed line). A mitotic cell
(white stars) proximal to the Paneth cell divides to produce two daughters (white balls) who
separate and then renter the epithelial plane adjacent to the Paneth cell. ii) Fixed image of
small-intestinal tissue, stained with Hoechst (Blue), Î˛4-Integrin (red), lysozyme (magenta)
and phalloidin (green). A recent mitosis produced two daughter cells (1, 2*) which have
become separated and have reinserted on either side of the Paneth cell. The image is the
same as that in Figure 5A, showing lysozyme staining.

organoids were stained with Hoechst (blue), phalloidin (red) and an antibody against Îłtubulin (green) to visualise DNA, F-actin and centrosomes.
C) A representative example of an ApcMin/Min cell undergoing mitotic slippage. Displayed are
stills from live-imaging of an ApcMin/Min H2B-GFP organoid. Chromosome condensation is
clearly observed as the cell enters prophase. Instead of proceeding with mitosis,
chromosomes de-condense as the cell returns to interphase.
D) A representative example of a wild-type organoid stained with Hoechst (blue), phalloidin
(red), Îł-tubulin (green) to visualise DNA, F-actin and centrosomes. Two mitotic cells are
highlighted, one in metaphase (top) and one in anaphase (bottom). Surface rendering in
Imaris can clearly highlight individual cells and their two centrosomes.
E) Potential spindle alignments in intestinal organoids. Spindle orientation was determined
in reference to: 1) the axis of tissue growth; the crypt-villus axis or 2) the apical surface.
Spindle orientations are the angle between the spindle and crypt-villus axis (Axial angle) or
apical surface (Apical angle). Examples of each type of spindle alignment is displayed; i)
Parallel to the crypt-villus axis (Crypt lengthening), ii) Perpendicular to the crypt-villus axis
(Crypt widening), iii) Parallel to the apical surface (âsymmetricâ division) or perpendicular to
the apical surface (âasymmetricâ division). Reference axes are highlighted by the white
dashed line.
F) Representative example of an asymmetrically and symmetrically oriented division in the
crypt base of an intestinal organoid. The organoid is stained with Hoechst (blue) and
phalloidin (red). Note that a pro-daughter cell in the asymmetrically aligned mitoses is
poised to inherit the basal process.
Spindle orientations were determined for mitoses in G) wild-type, H) ApcMin/+ and I)
ApcMin/Min organoids. Only apical angles could be calculated for ApcMin/Min organoids due to
loss of crypt-villus architecture. Data is displayed in reference to the crypt base. Angles
greater than 40Â° were classified as perpendicular. Angles less than 40Â° are classified as
parallel. Data is displayed as a function of distance along the crypt-villus axis. The stem cell
compartment was defined as the curved region at the base of branches, approximately
20Îźm from the lumenal crypt base.

for 4 days to induce cyst formation in WT organoids. Division subtypes were compared to
untreated organoids (ENR). Data was compared to the dataset in Figure 4B. (ENR N = 6

B) The position of each Lgr5-GFP+ cell was recorded and compared to the positions of the
total cell population with reference to the crypt base. Nuclear position was used as a
surrogate for cell position and distances were compared to the nucleus closest to the base
of the crypt. Data was pooled from 6 individual organoids. Data is displayed as mean +/- SD.
C) Diagram showing the defined compartments within intestinal crypts. The majority of
Lgr5+ stem cells were located approximately 0-40Îźm from the crypt base. This region was
termed the stem cell compartment. This equated to the curved region at the base of the
crypt, approximately 20Îźm from the lumenal crypt base. Above this region we defined as
the transit-amplifying compartment. A small fraction of GFP+ cells resided above the
defined stem cell compartment, similar to our previous studies in whole intestinal tissue.
D) Interkinetic nuclear migration is quantified as the distance of the query cell in reference
to the epithelial plane in which it originated. The plane of the epithelium is defined as the
plane in which neighbouring nuclei are located. A plane is defined by the co-ordinates of 3
points. Therefore the distance was measured between the query cell and the plane formed
by 3 of its neighbour nuclei. This process was repeated utilizing 5 neighbour cells. The
average distance for each of these 10 planes was determined as distance from the epithelial
plane.
E) Examples of INM measurement for a cell undergoing adjacent placement (Adjacent) or
post-mitotic separation (Separated). Distances were determined for each time-point during
prophase and for each of the daughter cells (red and blue lines).
