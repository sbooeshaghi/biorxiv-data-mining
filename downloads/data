"June 9, 2017",Decoding the orientation of contrast edges from MEG evoked and induced responses,NeuroImage,"[(Pantazis, Dimitrios), (Fang, Mingtong), (Qin, Sheng), (Mohsenzadeh, Yalda), (Li, Quanzheng), (Cichy, Radoslaw Martin)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/148056 ,"Visual gamma oscillations have been proposed to subserve perceptual binding, but their strong modulation by diverse stimulus features confounds interpretations of their precise functional role. Overcoming this challenge necessitates a comprehensive account of the relationship between gamma responses and stimulus features. Here we used multivariate pattern analyses on human MEG data to characterize the relationships between gamma responses and one basic stimulus feature, the orientation of contrast edges. Our findings confirmed we could decode orientation information from induced responses in two dominant frequency bands at 24-32 Hz and 50-58 Hz. Decoding was higher for cardinal than oblique orientations, with similar results also obtained for evoked MEG responses. In contrast to multivariate analyses, orientation information was mostly absent in univariate signals: evoked and induced responses in early visual cortex were similar in all orientations, with only exception an inverse oblique effect observed in induced responses, such that cardinal orientations produced weaker oscillatory signals than oblique orientations. Taken together, our results showed multivariate methods are well suited for the analysis of gamma oscillations, with multivariate patterns robustly encoding orientation information and predominantly discriminating cardinal from oblique stimuli.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/biorxiv/downloads/NeuroImage/NeuroImage1.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2017 , 6)]"

"June 9, 2017",An integrative method to unravel the host-parasite interactome: An orthology-based approach,Pre-print,"[(Cuesta Astroz, Yesid), (Santos, Alberto), (Oliveira, Guilherme), (Jensen, Lars Juhl)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/147868 ,"The study of molecular host parasite interactions is essential to understand parasitic infection and adaptation within the host system. As well, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases require clear understanding of the molecular crosstalk between parasites and their hosts. As yet, experimental large scale identification of host parasite molecular interactions remains challenging and the use of in silico predictions becomes then necessary. Here, we propose a computational integrative approach to predict host parasite protein protein interaction (PPI) networks resulting from the infection of human by 12 different parasites. We used an orthology-based method to transfer high confidence intra species interactions obtained from the STRING database to the corresponding inter species protein pairs in the host parasite system. To reduce the number of spurious predictions, our approach uses either the parasites predicted secretome and membrane proteins or only the secretome depending on whether they are uni or multicellular respectively. Besides, the host proteome is filtered for proteins expressed in selected cellular localizations and tissues supporting the parasites growth. We evaluated the inferred interactions by analyzing the enriched biological processes and pathways in the predicted networks and their association to known parasitic invasion and evasion mechanisms. The resulting PPI networks were compared across parasites to identify common mechanisms that may define a global pathogenic hallmark.

"June 9, 2017",Integrating long-range connectivity information into de Bruijn graphs,Pre-print,"[(Turner, Isaac), (Garimella, Kiran V.), (Iqbal, Zamin), (McVean, Gil)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/147777 ,"Motivation: The de Bruijn graph is a simple and efficient data structure that is used in many areas of sequence analysis including genome assembly, read error correction and variant calling. The data structure has a single parameter k, is straightforward to implement and is tractable for large genomes with high sequencing depth. It also enables representation of multiple samples simultaneously to facilitate comparison. However, unlike the string graph, a de Bruijn graph does not retain long range information that is inherent in the read data. For this reason, applications that rely on de Bruijn graphs can produce sub-optimal results given their input.  Results: We present a novel assembly graph data structure: the Linked de Bruijn Graph (LdBG). Constructed by adding annotations on top of a de Bruijn graph, it stores long range connectivity information through the graph. We show that with error-free data it is possible to losslessly store and recover sequence from a Linked de Bruijn graph. With assembly simulations we demonstrate that the LdBG data structure outperforms both the de Bruijn graph and the String Graph Assembler (SGA). Finally we apply the LdBG to Klebsiella pneumoniae short read data to make large (12 kbp) variant calls, which we validate using PacBio sequencing data, and to characterise the genomic context of drug-resistance genes.

Identifying how these morphogenetic movements are directed and implemented is essential for understanding morphogenesis. Topographical and scalar differences in adhesion and contractility within and between cells are essential, yet, the role that membrane remodeling may play remains less clear. To clarify how surface turnover and dynamics may modulate tissue arrangements we studied epiboly in the zebrafish. During epiboly the blastoderm expands as a result of an asymmetry of mechanical tension along the embryo surface. In this scenario, we found that the membrane removal by macropinocytosis of the external yolk cell syncytial layer (E-YSL) ahead of the blastoderm is key for epiboly progression In early zebrafish embryos, the activity of the GTPase Rab5ab was essential for endocytosis, and interference in its expression exclusively in the yolk cell resulted in the reduction of yolk cell actomyosin contractility, the disruption of cortical and internal yolk flows, a disequilibrium in force balance and as a result epiboly impairment. We conclude that regulated membrane remodeling is crucial for directing cell and tissue mechanics and coordinating morphogenetic movements during epiboly.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/biorxiv/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print4.pdf,"[( 29 Dec 2016 , 3)]"

Although several axon regeneration regulators have been proposed, intrinsic regenerative mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we use a Drosophila CNS injury model to identify a novel pro-regeneration signaling pathway. We conducted a genetic screen of approximately three hundred candidate genes and identified three strong inducers of axonal growth and regeneration: the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam1), the de-ubiquitinating enzyme Fat Facets (Faf)/Usp9x and the Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway transcription factor Kayak (Kay)/Fos. Genetic and biochemical analyses link these genes in a common signaling pathway whereby Faf stabilizes Dscam1 protein levels, by acting on the 3-UTR of its mRNA, and Dscam1 acts upstream of the growth-promoting JNK signal. The mammalian homolog of Faf, Usp9x/FAM, shares both the regenerative and Dscam1 stabilizing activities, suggesting a conserved mechanism.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/biorxiv/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print6.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2017 , 4), ( 10 Jun 2017 , 2), ( 13 Jun 2017 , 1)]"

Using ultra-fast microscopy in S. cerevisiae cells and improved analysis of mean square displacements, we quantified DNA motion at time scales ranging from 10 milliseconds to minutes and found that following DNA damage, DNA exhibits distinct subdiffusive regimes. In response to double-strand breaks, chromatin is more mobile at large time scales but, surprisingly, its mobility is dramatically reduced at short time scales. This effect is even more pronounced at the break. Such pattern of dynamics is consistent with a global increase in chromatin persistence length following DNA damage. Scale-dependent nuclear exploration is regulated by the Rad51 repair protein, both at the break and throughout the genome. We propose a model in which stiffening of the damaged ends by the repair complex, combined with global increased stiffness, act like a needle in a decompacted ball of yarn, enhancing the ability of the break to traverse the chromatin meshwork.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/biorxiv/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print7.pdf,"[( 15 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 02 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 02 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

Signaling is dependent on recruitment of Syk via docking of its dual SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosines within the FcϵRI immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Using single molecule imaging in live cells, we directly visualized and quantified the binding of individual mNeonGreen-tagged Syk molecules as they associated with the plasma membrane after FcϵRI activation. We found that Syk colocalizes transiently to FcϵRI and that Syk-FcϵRI binding dynamics are independent of receptor aggregate size. Substitution of glutamic acid for tyrosine between the Syk SH2 domains (SykY130E) led to an increased Syk-FcϵRI off-rate, loss of site-specific Syk autophosphorylation, and impaired downstream signaling. CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cells expressing only SykY130E were deficient in antigen-stimulated calcium release, degranulation and production of some cytokines (TNF-a, IL-3) but not others (MCP-1, IL-4).
