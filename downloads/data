"June 9, 2017",Differential Mast Cell Outcomes Are Sensitive to FcϵRI-Syk Binding Kinetics,Molecular Biology of the Cell,"[(Schwartz, Samantha L.), (Cleyrat, Cedric), (Olah, Mark), (Relich, Peter), (Phillips, Genevieve), (Hlavacek, William S.), (Lidke, Keith A.), (Wilson, Bridget S.)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/147595 ,"Crosslinking of IgE-bound FcϵRI triggers multiple cellular responses, including degranulation and cytokine production. Signaling is dependent on recruitment of Syk via docking of its dual SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosines within the FcϵRI immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Using single molecule imaging in live cells, we directly visualized and quantified the binding of individual mNeonGreen-tagged Syk molecules as they associated with the plasma membrane after FcϵRI activation. We found that Syk colocalizes transiently to FcϵRI and that Syk-FcϵRI binding dynamics are independent of receptor aggregate size. Substitution of glutamic acid for tyrosine between the Syk SH2 domains (SykY130E) led to an increased Syk-FcϵRI off-rate, loss of site-specific Syk autophosphorylation, and impaired downstream signaling. CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cells expressing only SykY130E were deficient in antigen-stimulated calcium release, degranulation and production of some cytokines (TNF-a, IL-3) but not others (MCP-1, IL-4). We propose that kinetic discrimination along the FcϵRI signaling pathway occurs at the level of Syk-FcϵRI interactions, with key outcomes dependent upon sufficiently long-lived Syk binding events.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Molecular Biology of the Cell/Molecular Biology of the Cell1.pdf
"June 9, 2017",Mutations in the Drosophila splicing regulator Prp31 as a model for Retinitis pigmentosa 11,Pre-print,"[(Lehmann, Malte), (Hebbar, Sarita), (Brandl, Holger), (Leng, Weihua), (Lakshmanaperumal, Naharajan), (Winkler, Sylke), (Knust, Elisabeth)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/147918 ,"Retinitis pigmentosa is a clinically heterogeneous disease affecting 1.6 million people worldwide. A growing number of identified disease-causing genes are associated with the spliceosome, but the molecular consequences that link defects in splicing factor genes to the aetiology of the disease remain to be elucidated. In this paper, we present a Drosophila model for Retinitis pigmentosa 11, a human disease caused by mutations in the splicing factor PRPF31. Here, we induced mutations in the Drosophila orthologue Prp31. Mutant flies are viable and show a normal eye phenotype when kept under regular light conditions. However, when exposed to constant light, photoreceptors of mutant flies degenerate, thus resembling the human disease phenotype. Degeneration could be shown to be associated with increased oxidative stress. This increase was in agreement with severe dysregulation of genes involved in oxidation/reduction processes, as revealed by high throughput transcriptome sequencing. In fact, light induced photoreceptor cell degeneration could be attenuated by experimentally reducing oxidative stress. A comparable decrease in retinal degeneration was achieved by raising mutant larvae on a vitamin A-depleted medium, thereby reducing rhodopsin levels. Finally, transcriptome data further uncovered an overall retention of introns in mRNAs. Among those, mRNAs of genes involved in synapse assembly, growth and stability were most prominent. These results point to a multifactorial genesis of light induced degeneration in retinae of Prp31 mutant flies, including transcriptional and splicing dysregulation, oxidative stress and defects in vitamin A metabolism.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print1.pdf

"June 8, 2017","Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic analysis of Plasmodium vivax salivary-gland sporozoites",Pre-print,"[(Jex, Aaron), (Mueller, Ivo), (Kappe, Stefan), (Mikolajcjak, Sebastian), (Sattabongkot, Jetsumon), (Patrapuvich, Rapatbhorn), (Lindner, Scott), (Flannery, Erika), (Koepfli, Cristian), (Ansell, Brendan), (Lerch, Anita), (Swearingen, Kristian E), (Moritz, Robert L), (Petter, Michaela), (Duffy, Michael), (Chuenchob, Vorada)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/145250 ,"Background: Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper-cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoite is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, and the potential mechanisms through which the development may be pre-programmed, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites.  Results: Our study highlights the loading of the salivary-gland sporozoite with proteins required for cell traversal and invasion and transcripts for infection of and development within hepatocytes. We characterise histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explore their role in regulating transcription. This work shows a close correlation between H3K9ac marks and transcriptional activity, with H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 appearing to act as general markers of euchromatin and heterochromatin respectively. We also identify the remarkable transcriptional silence in the (sub)telomeres and discuss potential roles of AP2 transcription factors, specifically ApiAP2-SP and L in regulating this stage.  Conclusions: Collectively, these data indicate the sporozoite as a tightly programmed stage primed to infect the human host and identifies key targets to be further explored in liver stage models.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print3.pdf
"June 8, 2017",Cross-tissue integration of genetic and epigenetic data offers insight into autism spectrum disorder,Nature Communications,"[(Andrews, Shan V.), (Ellis, Shannon E.), (Bakulski, Kelly M.), (Sheppard, Brooke), (Croen, Lisa A.), (Hertz-Picciotto, Irva), (Newschaffer, Craig J.), (Feinberg, Andrew P.), (Arking, Dan E.), (Ladd-Acosta, Christine), (Fallin, M. Daniele)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/091330 ,"Integration of emerging epigenetic information with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) genetic results may elucidate functional insights not possible via either type of information in isolation. We use genotype and DNA methylation (DNAm) data from cord blood and peripheral blood to identify SNPs associated with DNA methylation (meQTL lists) and additionally use publicly available fetal brain and lung meQTL lists to assess enrichment of ASD GWAS results for tissue-specific meQTLs. ASD-associated SNPs are enriched for fetal brain (OR = 3.55; p < 0.001) and peripheral blood meQTLs (OR = 1.58; p < 0.001). The CpG targets of ASD meQTLs across cord, blood, and brain tissues are enriched for immune-related pathways, consistent with other expression and DNAm results in ASD, and reveal pathways not implicated by genetic findings. This joint analysis of genotype and DNAm demonstrates the potential of both brain and blood-based DNAm for insights into ASD and psychiatric phenotypes more broadly.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Nature Communications/Nature Communications1.pdf
"June 8, 2017",Drosophila mutants that are motile but respond poorly to all stimuli tested,Pre-print,"[(Vang, Lar L), (Adler, Julius)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/045062 ,"Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. Some possibilities for explaining the deficiency: They may be considered defective in decision making that results from faulty interaction with the sensing mechanism, or, alternatively, the mutants may be defective in executive function. The mutants failed at both 34 degrees C and, in one case studied, at room temperature.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Pre-print/Pre-print4.pdf
"June 8, 2017",On the heritability of criminal justice processing,Sage Open,"[(Boutwell, Brian B), (Connolly, Eric)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/107748 ,"An impressive number of researchers have devoted a great amount of effort toward examining various predictors of criminal justice processing outcomes. Indeed, a vast amount of research has examined various individual- and aggregate-level predictors of arrests, incarceration, and sentencing decisions. To this point, less attention has been devoted toward uncovering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on variation in risk for criminal justice processing. As a result, the current study employs a behavioral genetic design in order to help fill this void in the existing literature. Using twin data from a national sample of youth, the current study produced evidence suggesting that genetic factors accounted for at least a portion of variance in risk for incarceration among female twins and probation among male twins.  Shared and nonshared environmental influences accounted for the variance in risk for arrest among both female and male twins, probation among female twins, and incarceration among male twins. Ultimately, it appears that risk for contact with the criminal justice system and criminal justice processing is structured by a combination of factors beyond shared cultural and neighborhood environments, and appear to also include genetic factors as well. Moving forward, continuing to not use genetically sensitive research designs capable of estimating the role of genetic and nonshared environmental influences on criminal justice outcomes may result in misleading results.",/Users/sinabooeshaghi/Documents/Projects/Code/scraper-practice/downloads/Sage Open/Sage Open1.pdf
