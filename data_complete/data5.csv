"June 19, 2016",BlastPhyMe: A toolkit for rapid generation and analysis of protein-coding sequence datasets,Pre print,"[(Schott, Ryan K,  University of Toronto), (Gow, Daniel,  University of Toronto), (Chang, Belinda SW,  University of Toronto)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/059881 ,"SUMMARY: We present BlastPhyMe (BLAST, Phylogenies, and Molecular Evolution) a new application to facilitate the fast and easy generation and analysis of protein-coding sequence datasets. The application uses a portable database framework to manage and organize sequences along with a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the application extremely easy to use. BlastPhyMe utilizes several existing services and applications in a unique way that save researchers considerable time when building and analyzing protein-coding datasets. The application consists of two modules that can be used separately or together. The first module enables the assembly of coding sequence datasets. BLAST searches can be used to obtain all related sequences of interest from NCBI. Full GenBank records are saved within the database and coding sequences are automatically extracted. A feature of particular note is that sequences can be sorted based on NCBI taxonomic hierarchy before export to MEGA for visualization. The application provides GUIs for automatic alignment of sequences with the popular tools MUSCLE and PRANK, as well as for reconstructing phylogenetic trees using PhyML. The second module incorporates selection analyses using codon-based likelihood methods. The alignments and phylogenetic trees generated with the dataset module, or those generated elsewhere, can be used to run the models implemented in the codeml PAML package. A GUI allows easy selection of models and parameters. Importantly, replicate analyses with different parameter starting values can be automatically performed in order to ensure selection of the best-fitting model. Multiple analyses can be run simultaneously based on the number of processor cores available, while additional analyses will be run iteratively until completed. Results are saved within the database and can be exported to publication-ready Excel tables, which further automatically compute the appropriate likelihood ratio test between models in order to determine statistical significance. Future updates will add additional options for phylogenetic reconstruction (eg, MrBayes) and selection analyses (eg, HYPHY). BlastPhyMe saves researches of all bioinformatics experience levels considerable time by automating the numerous tasks required for the generation and analysis of protein-coding sequence datasets using a straightforward graphical interface.

Rodents are intermediate hosts for numerous zoonotic bacteria. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are very useful for the detection and surveillance of zoonotic bacteria, but rigorous experimental processes are required for the use of these cheap and effective tools in such epidemiological contexts. In particular, HTS introduces biases into the raw dataset that might lead to incorrect interpretations. We describe here a procedure for cleaning data before estimating reliable biological parameters, such as bacterial positivity, prevalence and coinfection, by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. This procedure, applied to 711 commensal rodents collected from 24 villages in Senegal, Africa, detected several emerging bacterial genera, some in high prevalence, while never before reported for West Africa. This study constitutes a step towards the use of HTS to improve our understanding of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission posed by wildlife, by providing a new strategy for the use of HTS platforms to monitor both bacterial diversity and infection dynamics in wildlife. In the future, this approach could be adapted for the monitoring of other microbes such as protists, fungi, and even viruses.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/mSystems/mSystems5.pdf,"[( 28 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 18 Feb 2016 , 15), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 25 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 02 May 2016 , 2), ( 17 Feb 2016 , 5), ( 22 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 31 May 2016 , 5), ( 21 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 6), ( 28 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 27 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

A single clone of the pathogen (Hap_1) was likely introduced in the United States while Eurasian population comprised of several haplotypes. The origin and spread of P. destructans remain enigmatic due in part to a lack of precise population markers. We searched for P. destructans mycoviruses as they are highly host-specific, and their spread could provide a window on the origin of the host fungus. We discovered a P. destructans bipartite virus PdPV-1 with two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments - LS (1,683 bp) and SS (1,524 bp) with motifs similar to viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and putative capsid proteins (CPs), respectively. Both LS and SS ORFs were embedded only in the positive strand of each dsRNA segment. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis suggested that both segments constitute the genome of a new virus similar to the mycoviruses in the family Partitiviridae genus Gammapartitivirus. Purified viral particles appeared as isometric virions with approximately 33 nm diameters typical of partitiviruses. A newly developed RT-PCR assay revealed that all US isolates and only a few Eurasian isolates were infected with PdPV-1. PdPV-1 was P. destructans - specific as closely related non-pathogenic fungi P. appendiculatus and P. roses tested negative.

The human gut contains approximately 10e+14 bacteria, belonging to hundreds of different species. Together, these microbial species form a complex food web that can break down food sources that our own digestive enzymes cannot handle, including complex polysaccharides, producing short chain fatty acids and additional metabolites, e.g., vitamin K. The diversity of microbial diversity is important for colonic health: Changes in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obestity and Crohn's disease, and make the microbiota more vulnerable to infestation by harmful species, e.g., Clostridium difficile. To get a grip on the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut, we here propose a multi-scale, spatiotemporal dynamic flux-balance analysis model to study the emergence of metabolic diversity in a spatial gut-like, tubular environment. The model features genome-scale metabolic models of microbial populations, resource sharing via extracellular metabolites, and spatial population dynamics and evolution.
Results:
In this model, cross-feeding interactions emerge readily, despite the species' ability to metabolize sugars autonomously. Interestingly, the community requires cross-feeding for producing a realistic set of short-chain fatty acids from an input of glucose, If we let the composition of the microbial subpopulations change during invasion of adjacent space, a complex and stratifed microbiota evolves, with subspecies specializing on cross-feeding interactions via a mechanism of compensated trait loss. The microbial diversity and stratification collapse if the flux through the gut is enhanced to mimic diarrhea. 
Conclusions:

Here, we show that Drosophila can extend their viable temperature range through temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour.  Above 15˚C, Drosophila feed and lay eggs on yeast.  In contrast, below 15˚C, Drosophila prefer to feed and lay eggs on plant material.  The different lipids present in yeast and plants improve survival at high and low temperatures, respectively. Yeast lipids promote high tempera-ture survival by increasing systemic insulin signalling.  This expands the range over which developmental rate increases with temperature, suggesting that faster nutrient utilization is required to fuel biochemical reactions driven faster by ki-netic energy. In addition to speeding development, yeast lipids increase fertility. Thus, yeast provide cues that could help Drosophila to exploit a transient summer food resource. Plant lipids, on the other hand, are required to maintain mem-brane lipid fluidity at low temperature, and increase cold-resistance of larvae and adults. The cold-resistance and lowered insulin signalling conferred by feeding on plants allows adults to survive for many months at temperatures consistent with overwintering in temperate climates.

The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As f and C are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the 3'-end hairpin (I-F). Finally, the 5'-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (E-I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log C)α with α = 1 (0.5) for E-I (I-F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins.

tail lengths - including a computational pipeline implementing all necessary analyses. PASP uses direct Illumina sequencing of cDNA fragments obtained through G-tailing of poly(A)-selected mRNA followed by fragmentation and reverse transcription.
Analysis of reads corresponding to spike-in poly(A) tracts of known length indicated that mean tail lengths can be confidently measured, given sufficient coverage. We further explored the utility of our approach by comparing tail lengths estimated from wild type and Δccr4-1/pan2 mutant yeasts.

Shifts in ploidy affect the evolutionary dynamics of genomes in a myriad of ways. Population genetic theory predicts that transposable element (TE) proliferation may follow because the genome wide efficacy of selection should be reduced and the increase in gene copies may mask the deleterious effects of TE insertions. Moreover, in allopolyploids TEs may further accumulate because of hybrid breakdown of TE silencing. However, to date the evidence of TE proliferation following an increase in ploidy is mixed, and the relative importance of relaxed selection vs. silencing breakdown remains unclear. 
Methods
We used high-coverage whole genome sequence data to evaluate the abundance, genomic distribution, and population frequencies of TEs in the self-fertilizing recent allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae). We then compared the C. bursa-pastoris TE profile with that of its two parental diploid species, outcrossing C. grandiflora and self-fertilizing C. orientalis.  
Key results
We found no evidence that C. bursa-pastoris has experienced a large genome wide proliferation of TEs relative to its parental species. However, when centromeric regions are excluded, we find evidence of significantly higher abundance of retrotransposons in C. bursa-pastoris along the gene-rich chromosome arms, compared to C. grandiflora and C. orientalis.  
Conclusions 
The lack of a genome-wide effect of allopolyploidy on TE abundance, combined with the increases TE abundance in gene-rich regions suggest that relaxed selection rather than hybrid breakdown of host silencing explains the TE accumulation in C. bursa-pastoris.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/American Journal Of Botany/American Journal Of Botany5.pdf,"[( 08 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 04 Mar 2016 , 13), ( 22 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 05 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

Here we develop ecological theory to analyze plant distribution and trait data across Europe and find that plant height clustering is related to evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. Our analysis suggests competitive dominance as a plausible mechanism underlying community assembly patterns over continental scales. In particular, we find a clear signal of plant-to-plant competition in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual evapotranspiration rates and gross primary productivities) are optimal. Under severe conditions, either climate is too harsh and overrides the effect of competition or other interactions play a relevant role.

Materials and Methods: The number of CT, radiograph, US, MRI, and total number of imaging exams performed in pediatric patients were determined for each year between 2003 and 2013. A retrospective search was performed for years 2007, 2008, and 2013 on pediatric emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis. The imaging algorithm of these patients was investigated by determining whether the patient received an US or a CT exam first, and what imaging exams were ordered in total for the patient work-up.
Results: When comparing the mean prior to the Image Gently Campaign (2003-2007) to data from 2013, there has been a 33% decrease in the number of CT exams, a 19% decrease in the number of radiograph exams, a 13% increase in the number of US exams, and a 19% increase in the number of MRI exams. In 2007, 37.5% received an US and 62.5% received a CT as the initial exam for suspected appendicitis.  In 2013, 85.4% received an US and 14.6% received a CT as the initial imaging evaluation for suspected appendicitis.

Currently, the field largely focuses on potential disease causing variants that fall within coding sequences and that are predicted to cause protein sequence changes, generally discarding non-coding variants. However non-coding DNA makes up ~98% of the genome and contains a range of sequences essential for controlling the expression of protein coding genes. Thus, potentially causative non-coding variation is currently being overlooked. To address this, we have designed an approach to assess variation in one class of non-coding regulatory DNA; the 3′UTRome. Variants in the 3′UTR region of genes are of particular interest because 3′UTRs are responsible for modulating protein expression levels via their interactions with microRNAs. Furthermore they are amenable to large scale analysis as 3′UTR-microRNA interactions are based on complementary base pairing and as such can be predicted in silico at the genome-wide level. We report a strategy for identifying and functionally testing variants in microRNA binding sites within the 3'UTRome and demonstrate the efficacy of this pipeline in a cohort of language impaired children. Using whole exome sequence data from 43 probands, we extracted variants that lay within 3′UTR microRNA binding sites. We identified a common variant (SNP) in a microRNA binding site and found this SNP to be associated with an endophenotype of language impairment (non-word repetition). We showed that this variant disrupted microRNA regulation in cells and was linked to altered gene expression in the brain, suggesting it may represent a risk factor contributing to SLI. This work demonstrates that biologically relevant variants are currently being under-investigated despite the wealth of next-generation sequencing data available and presents a simple strategy for interrogating non-coding regions of the genome. We propose that this strategy should be routinely applied to whole exome and whole genome sequence data in order to broaden our understanding of how non-coding genetic variation underlies complex phenotypes such as neurodevelopmental disorders.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1713.pdf,"[( 27 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 24 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 23 Jun 2016 , 12)]"

A tel1Δ mutant had globally increased amounts of Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes and altered Spo11-oligonucleotide lengths, consistent with conserved roles for Tel1 in control of DSB number and processing.

In humans, haplotypes are typically estimated from unphased sequence or genotyping data using statistical models applied to large reference panels. To assess the importance of correct haplotype phase on population history inference, we performed fosmid pool sequencing and resolved phased haplotypes of five individuals from diverse African populations (including Yoruba, Esan, Gambia, Massai and Mende). We physically phased 98% of heterozygous SNPs into haplotype-resolved blocks, obtaining a block N50 of 1 Mbp.

Highly virulent microparasites could also curtail host development, thereby limiting both the host resources available to them and their own within-host effective population size. High virulence might therefore curtail the mutation supply rate and increase the strength with which genetic drift acts on microparasite populations, thereby limiting the potential to adapt to the host and ultimately perhaps the ability to evolve lower virulence. As a first exploration of this hypothesis, we evolved Tobacco etch virus carrying an eGFP fluorescent marker in two semi-permissive host species, Nicotiana benthamiana and Datura stramonium, for which it has a large difference in virulence. We compared the results to those previously obtained in the typical host, Nicotiana tabacum, where we have shown that carriage of eGFP has a high fitness cost and its loss serves as a real-time indicator of adaptation.
Results: After over half a year of evolution, we sequenced the genomes of the evolved lineages and measured their fitness. During the evolution experiment, marker loss leading to viable virus variants was only observed in one lineage of the host for which the virus has low virulence, D. stramonium. This result was consistent with the observation that there was a fitness cost of eGFP in this host, while surprisingly no fitness cost was observed in the host for which the virus has high virulence, N. benthamiana. Furthermore, in both hosts we observed few lineages with increases in viral fitness, and host-specific convergent evolution at the genomic level was only found in N. benthamiana.
Conclusions: The results of this study do not lend support to the hypothesis that high virulence impedes microparasites' evolution. Rather, they exemplify that jumps between host species can be game changers for evolutionary dynamics. When considering the evolution of genome architecture, host species jumps might play a very important role, by allowing evolutionary intermediates to be competitive.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1715.pdf,"[( 23 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 22 Jun 2016 , 13)]"

In addition to many shared regulators, we found that tumor and normal cells are differentially sensitive to loss of the histone genes transcriptional regulator CASP8AP2. In cancer cells, loss of CASP8AP2 leads to a failure to synthesize sufficient amount of histones in the S-phase of the cell cycle, resulting in slowing of individual replication forks. Despite this, DNA replication fails to arrest, and tumor cells progress in an elongated S-phase that lasts several days, finally resulting in death of most of the affected cells. In contrast, depletion of CASP8AP2 in normal cells triggers a response that arrests viable cells in S-phase. The arrest is dependent on p53, and preceded by accumulation of markers of DNA damage, indicating that nucleosome depletion is sensed in normal cells via a DNA-damage -like response that is defective in tumor cells.

Inventorying requires comprehensive sampling, while monitoring should build on it and focus on as few components as possible to detect changes in time or space. To sample or acquire information for both purposes can therefore be viewed as different processes, herewith called α-sampling and β-sampling. Biodiversity covers species, their genetic diversity and the way they interact in communities and ecosystems. Quantifying these aspects leads to the need to study taxon (TD), phylogenetic (PD) and functional diversity (FD). Here we propose and test a method for the optimization of sampling protocols to inventorying and monitoring TD, PD and FD for a wide range of taxa.
2. We used spiders as a case-study, although the same optimization procedure could be applied to any taxon requiring a combination of sampling methods. Spiders were sampled in multiple sites in the Iberian Peninsula. PD and FD were measured as the sum of the length of branches on a phylogenetic or functional tree. To reach the optimal combination of methods for inventory, we followed an iterative procedure optimizing the accumulation curve of diversity values. Optimal monitoring in space or time required minimizing the difference between sampled and true β-diversity. We used a framework that disentangles species replacement and richness differences contributions to overall β-diversity.
3. For α-diversity, the optimal combination of 24 samples for TD, PD and FD allowed sampling more than 50% of real diversity. For β-diversity, the optimal combination of six samples for all measures allowed reaching a bias (difference between sampled and true diversity) below 0.08.
4. The widespread use of similar sampling protocols worldwide and regular repetition in time can have a major impact on the scope and usefulness of global monitoring projects. In addition, the comparable sampling of biodiversity in space and/or time allows reusing of data collected for specific purposes, potentiating a synergistic effect among different projects. This makes data useful much beyond their initial plan. We strongly advocate the optimization, standardization and widespread adoption of sampling protocols for all taxa at a global level, for both inventory and monitoring of all levels of biodiversity: taxon, phylogenetic and functional.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1718.pdf,"[( 23 Jun 2016 , 5)]"

Here we show that the spike timing of place cells couples to theta phase before major increases in firing rate, anticipating the animal's entrance into the classical, rate-based place field. In contrast, spikes rapidly decouple from theta as the animal leaves the place field and firing rate decreases. Therefore, temporal coding has strong asymmetry around the place field center. We further show that the dynamics of temporal coding along space evolves in three stages: phase coupling, phase precession and phase decoupling.

Despite the possible evolutionary advantages, there are fewer examples of redundant sequences in viral genomes, particularly those with RNA genomes.  The low prevalence of gene duplication in RNA viruses most likely reflects the strong selective constraints against increasing genome size.  Here we investigated the stability of genetically redundant sequences and how adaptive evolution proceeds to remove them.  We generated plant RNA viruses with potentially beneficial gene duplications, measured their fitness and performed experimental evolution, hereby exploring their genomic stability and evolutionary potential.  We found that all gene duplication events resulted in a loss of viability or significant reductions in fitness.  Moreover, upon evolving the viable viruses and analyzing their genomes, we always observed the deletion of the duplicated gene copy and maintenance of the ancestral copy.  Interestingly, there were clear differences in the deletion dynamics of the duplicated gene associated with the passage duration, the size of the gene and the position for duplication.  Based on the experimental data, we developed a mathematical model to characterize the stability of genetically redundant sequences, and showed that the fitness of viruses with duplications is not enough information to predict genomic stability as a recombination rate dependent on the genetic context - the duplicated gene and its position - is also required.  Our results therefore demonstrate experimentally the deleterious nature of gene duplications in RNA viruses, and we identify factors that constrain the maintenance of duplicated genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Biology and Evolution/Genome Biology and Evolution26.pdf,"[( 28 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 27 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 7)]"

Most of the current aligners focus on aligning NGS datasets against long reference sequences rather than comparing between datasets. As the number of metagenomes and other genomic data increases each year, there is a demand for more sophisticated, faster sequence alignment algorithms. Here, we introduce a novel sequence aligner, Qudaich, which can efficiently process large volumes of data and is suited to de novo comparisons of next generation reads datasets.

Such models omit cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that strongly affects the volume currents. We present a four-compartment (4-C) boundary-element (BEM) model that incorporates the CSF and is computationally efficient and straightforward to build using freely available software. We propose a way for compensating the omission of CSF by decreasing the skull conductivity of the 3-S model, and study the robustness of the 4-C and 3-S models to errors in skull conductivity.
We generated dense boundary meshes using MRI datasets and automated SimNIBS pipeline. Then, we built a dense 4-C reference model using Galerkin BEM, and 4-C and 3-S test models using coarser meshes and both Galerkin and collocation BEMs. We compared field topographies of cortical sources, applying various skull conductivities and fitting conductivities that minimized the relative error in 4-C and 3-S models. When the CSF was left out from the EEG model, our compensated, unbiased approach improved the accuracy of the 3-S model considerably compared to the conventional approach, where CSF is neglected without any compensation (mean relative error < 20% vs. > 40%). The error due to the omission of CSF was of the same order in MEG and compensated EEG. EEG has, however, large overall error due to uncertain skull conductivity.
Our results show that a realistic 4-C MEG/EEG model can be implemented using standard tools and basic BEM, without excessive workload or computational burden.

Female BRCA mutation-positive relatives of ovarian cancer patients could undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed that included the risks of breast and ovarian cancer, the costs, utilities and effects of risk-reducing surgery on cancer rates, and the costs, utilities and mortality rates associated with cancer.

Results: BRCA testing all women with epithelial ovarian cancer each year is cost-effective at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY compared with no testing, with an ICER of £4,339/QALY. The result was primarily driven by fewer cases of breast (142) and ovarian (141) cancer and associated reductions in mortality (77 fewer deaths) in relatives over the subsequent 50 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in the input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of germline BRCA mutation testing being cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000/QALY was 99.9%.

Conclusions: Implementing germline BRCA testing in all ovarian cancer patients would be cost-effective in the UK. The consequent reduction of future cases of breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of mutation-positive individuals would ease the burden of cancer treatments in subsequent years and result in significantly better outcomes and reduced mortality rates for these individuals.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1720.pdf,"[( 25 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 23 Jun 2016 , 3)]"

Thus, most mutations fix within MA lines independently of their fitness effects. This approach, more recently combined with genome sequencing, has detailed the rates, spectra, and biases of different mutational processes. However, a quantitative understanding of the fitness effects of mutations virtually unseen by selection has remained an untapped opportunity. Here, we analyzed the fitness of 43 sequenced MA lines of the multi-chromosome bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia that had each undergone 5554 generations of MA and accumulated an average of 6.73 spontaneous mutations. Most lineages exhibited either neutral or deleterious fitness in three different environments in comparison with their common ancestor. The only mutational class that was significantly overrepresented in lineages with reduced fitness was the loss of the plasmid, though nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and coding insertion-deletion mutations were also overrepresented in MA lineages whose fitness had significantly declined. Although the overall distribution of fitness effects was similar between the three environments, the magnitude and even the sign of the fitness of a number of lineages changed with the environment, demonstrating that the fitness of some genotypes was environmentally dependent. These results present an unprecedented picture of the fitness effects of spontaneous mutations in a bacterium with multiple chromosomes and provide greater quantitative support of the theory that the vast majority of spontaneous mutations are neutral or deleterious.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics88.pdf,"[( 28 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 27 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 24 Jun 2016 , 13)]"

An example is the innovation of synchronous movement rituals which seem to engage the same altruistic response as instinctual mimicry. Arguments against this hypothesis are based in the idea that cheap markers of altruistic intent (""Green Beards"")are vulnerable to manipulation from non-cooperating free-riders that are similarly marked. This paper formally models the gene-culture coevolutionary dynamics of a system in which a costly socially learned ritual practice coevolves with the genes underpinning the prosocial response. This takes a 'genetic mismatch' hypothesis (where fast evolution of socially learned behaviors create a temporary mismatch with the coevolving genes, which take longer to evolve to equilibrium) and models it dynamically. The genetic and cultural fitness equations are first analyzed for equilibrium and then simulations are used to predicting trajectories for both the socially learned behavior and the hijacked genetic trait over time. Relying on fast culture and slow genes, it demonstrates how high levels of ritual efficacy may be established, at least temporarily, through gene culture interaction. It also shows how longer term feedbacks on the genes from culture may lead to decreases in the prosocial gene in the population and reduced overall population mean fitness, despite high levels of altruism in the population.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1723.pdf,"[( 26 Jun 2016 , 4), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 6)]"

Many such bonded groups and pairs are observed to take part in costly ritualized movement behavior that is hypothesized to trigger or maintain altruistic sentiments amongst the participants. Such costly ritualized practices could have evolved if they engaged pre-existing behavioral instincts that manifest as altruism in the new context of ritual bonding. While this seems at first to be a 'Green Beard' hypothesis ('marker (ie., 'green beard') as honest signal of altruistic intent', an hypothesis well-known to be problematic), it is distinct in two important ways. First, the ritual as marker is costly, and second the ritual engages a pre-existing behavioral potential caused by genes which, importantly, have some other benefit. This paper models the genetic coevolutionary dynamics both analytically and through simulation. It finds that such coevolution can lead to fixation of altruism in a population or to cycling of altruism in the population, depending on the balance of costs and benefits. Where cycling occurs, even though altruism is consistently present in the population, population mean fitness declines with the introduction of these bonding rituals.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1724.pdf,"[( 26 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 5)]"

If only true believers are willing to endure ritual behaviors and true belief also entails belief in altruistic cooperation, associating with other ritual practitioners can help solve cooperation dilemmas in groups by sorting out potential free-riders. While this hypothesis is obviously true if such 'faking' of ritual is strictly impossible, strict impossibility seems implausible. 'Faking' is defined by Irons in this context to be to be performing the ritual without commitment to group beliefs. In this paper, I posit various ways that such faking might be difficult, instead of impossible, or different ways in which such ritual faking might be 'costly' and then formally model the social learning and cultural evolution dynamics to see where it may still hold theoretically that such rituals help maintain altruism in group and under what conditions. Analytic solution for evolutionary equilibrium is derived for each model, verifying that under a wide range of conditions for some, but not all interpretations, such hard-to fake rituals can help groups solve cooperative dilemmas, including in some circumstances that might not be intuitively obvious, such as where such free-riding is not visible and free-riders successfully represent themselves as true believers to observers.
It is also the case that while there has been some progress in cleaning up the definitional confusions in the animal signaling literature around costly signaling, the literature on human rituals as costly signals has introduced novel uses of the term 'cost'. Theories referring to completely different mechanisms or even definitions of 'cost' are sometimes conflated. To contextualize the analysis of costly-to-fake rituals, this paper provides a review of the ideas proposed in the literature on costly human rituals and differentiates them from costly signaling as used in the animal behavior literature.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1725.pdf,"[( 15 Aug 2016 , 4), ( 18 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 30 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 16 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

A commercial food processor was used to homogenize food gels, and the torque was monitored as an electric current value, which was correlated with the viscosity of Newtonian fluid. Agar and gelatin gels at several concentrations were applied to the mixing-recording system, and individual mixing curves were obtained. The current values had a different tendency at each mixing stage. At the beginning of the mixing, when lumps of the original gel were present, current values of gelatin were higher than those of agar. From the middle of mixing, the fractured pastes of high-concentration agar gels had little mobility, and current values decreased, indicating that gelatin was more cohesive than agar. The current values of low-concentration agar and gelatin were correlated with the hardness of the gels and were aligned on the same correlation curve, indicating that the viscosity of the fractured paste was correlated with the original gel hardness under certain conditions.

Norovirus infection results in the induction of the innate response leading to interferon stimulated gene (ISG) transcription. However the translation of the induced ISG mRNAs is suppressed. Using a novel mass spectrometry approach we demonstrate that diminished host mRNA translation correlates with changes to the composition of the eukaryotic initiation factor complex. The suppression of host ISG translation correlates with the activity of the viral protease (NS6) and the activation of cellular caspases leading to the establishment of an apoptotic environment. These results indicate that noroviruses exploit the differences between viral VPg-dependent and cellular cap-dependent translation in order to diminish the host response to infection.,/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular & Cellular Proteomics/Molecular & Cellular Proteomics3.pdf,"[( 27 Jun 2016 , 9)]"

Such investigation is particularly powerful when applied to a ring species, in which spatial variation represents changes during the evolution of two species from one. We examined genomic variation among three subspecies of the greenish warbler ring species, using genotypes at 13,013,950 nucleotide sites along a new greenish warbler consensus genome assembly. Genomic regions of low within-group variation are remarkably consistent between the three populations. These regions show high relative differentiation but low absolute differentiation between populations. Comparisons with outgroup species show the locations of these peaks of relative differentiation are not well explained by phylogenetically-conserved variation in recombination rates or selection. These patterns are consistent with a model in which selection in an ancestral form has reduced variation at some parts of the genome, and those same regions experience recurrent selection that subsequently reduces variation within each subspecies. The degree of heterogeneity in nucleotide diversity is greater than explained by models background selection, but are consistent with selective sweeps. Given the evidence that greenish warblers have had both population differentiation for a long period of time and periods of gene flow between those populations, we propose that some genomic regions underwent selective sweeps over a broad geographic area followed by within-population selection-induced reductions in variation. An important implication of this ""sweep-before-differentiation"" model is that genomic regions of high relative differentiation may have moved among populations more recently than other genomic regions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular Ecology/Molecular Ecology23.pdf,"[( 28 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 27 Feb 2016 , 13), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 6), ( 03 Aug 2016 , 2)]"

As the interest lies in how HIV-1 spread in a human population, many previous studies have ignored details about the evolutionary process of the pathogen. Because phylogenetics investigates the evolutionary history of the pathogen rather than the spread between hosts per se, we first investigated the effects of including a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations. In particular, we investigated if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic.

We model mechanisms of coordination among ants during cooperative transport, a challenging task that requires a consensus on travel direction. Decisions required for cooperative transport differ from other, well-studied consensus decisions because groups often deadlock, with individuals trying to move in opposing directions, and cooperative transport groups are often relatively small. Small groups may be more affected by individual nonconformity. Using deterministic and stochastic models, we investigate behavioral factors that affect deadlock duration. Our goal is to determine whether groups following simple behavioral rules can reach a consensus using minimal information. We define and investigate multiple types of behavioral rules that govern individual behavior and also differ in the information available. We find that if individuals more readily give up when they are going against the majority, groups rapidly break deadlocks. This occurs through positive and negative feedbacks that are implemented in our model via a single mechanism. We also find that to quickly reach a consensus, groups must have either a shared bias, high sensitivity to group behavior, or finely tuned persistence. While inspired by ants, our results are generalizable to other collective decisions with deadlocks, and demonstrate that groups of behaviorally simple individuals with no memory and extremely limited information can break symmetry and reach a consensus in a decision between two equal options.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE145.pdf,"[( 18 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

These organisms owe their namesake to a fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology that has the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. The first description of a non-fictional chimera dates back to the middle of the seventeenth century when the Florentine gardener Pietro Nati discovered an adventitious shoot growing from the graft junction between sour orange (Citrus aurantium) and citron (C. medica). This perplexing chimera that grows with sectors phenotypically resembling each of the citrus progenitors inspired discussion and wonder from the scientific community and was fittingly named the Bizzaria. Initially, the Bizzaria was believed to be an asexual hybrid that formed from a cellular fusion between the grafted parents; however, in-depth cellular analyses carried out centuries later demonstrated that the Bizzaria, along with other chimeras, owe their unique sectored appearance to a conglomeration of cells from the two donors. Since this pivotal discovery at the turn of the twentieth century, chimeras have served both as tools and as unique biological phenomena that have contributed to our understanding of plant development at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Rapid advancements in genome sequencing technologies have enabled the establishment of new model species with novel morphological and developmental features that enable the generation of chimeric organisms.

Exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) gas as a killing method is aversive and exposure to high concentrations likely to be painful. Bradycardia during exposure to CO2 is associated with nociception and pain. However, it is unclear if bradycardia occurs before loss of consciousness as this is variably defined in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between recumbency, loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a quiescent electromyograph as measures of loss of consciousness, and identify the onset of bradycardia in relation to these measures.
Methods:
Thirty-two adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a telemetry device and randomly assigned to one of four killing methods (100% CO2, CO2 (70%)/O2 (30%), isoflurane (5%) and intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Time to achieve recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph, heart rate and apnea were recorded.
Results:
The general order of progression was recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph and apnea. Recumbency preceded LORR in the majority of animals (CO2; 7/8, CO2/O2; 8/8, isoflurane; 5/8, pentobarbital; 4/8). Bradycardia occurred before recumbency in the CO2 (p = 0.0002) and CO2/O2 (p = 0.005) groups, with a 50% reduction in heart rate compared to baseline. The slowest (time to apnea) and least consistent killing methods were CO2/O2 (1180 ± 658.1s) and pentobarbital (875 [239 to 4680]s).
Conclusion:
Bradycardia, and consequently nociception and pain, occurs before loss of consciousness during CO2 exposure.

Here, via the use of two-dimensional Hermite (TDH) functions, we identify a covert symmetry in high-order statistics of natural images that simplifies this task.  This emerges from the structure of TDH functions, which are an orthogonal set of functions that are organized into a hierarchy of ranks.  Specifically, we find that the shape (skewness and kurtosis) of the distribution of filter coefficients depends only on the projection of the function onto a 1-dimensional subspace specific to each rank.

We examine such collective problem solving by studying obstacle navigation during cooperative transport in ants. In cooperative transport, a group of ants works together to move a large object back to their nest. We blocked cooperative transport groups of Paratrechinal longicornis with obstacles of varying complexity, analyzing groups trajectories to infer what kind of strategy the ants employed. Simple strategies require little information, but more challenging, robust strategies succeed with a wider range of obstacles. We found that transport groups use a stochastic strategy that leads to efficient navigation around simple obstacles, and still succeeds at difficult ones. While groups navigating obstacles preferentially move directly toward the nest, they change their behavior over time; the longer the ants are obstructed, the more likely they are to move away from the nest. This increases the chance of finding a path around the obstacle. Groups rapidly changed directions and rarely stalled during navigation, indicating that these ants maintain consensus even when the nest direction is blocked. While some decisions were aided by the arrival of new ants, at many key points direction changes were initiated within the group, with no apparent external cause.

We find that Smart‑seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most genes per cell and across cells. However, it shows more amplification noise than CEL‑seq, Drop‑seq and SCRB‑seq as it cannot use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We use simulations to model how the observed combinations of sensitivity and amplification noise affects detection of differentially expressed genes and find that SCRB‑seq reaches 80% power with the fewest number of cells. When considering cost-efficiency at different sequencing depths at 80% power, we find that Drop‑seq is preferable when quantifying transcriptomes of a large numbers of cells with low sequencing depth, SCRB‑seq is preferable when quantifying transcriptomes of fewer cells and Smart‑seq2 is preferable when annotating and/or quantifying transcriptomes of fewer cells as long one can use in-house produced transposase.

The limited genomic resources available for water buffalo, in conjunction with an unconfirmed inheritance pattern, required an original approach to identify genetic variants associated with this disease. The genomes of 4 bilaterally affected cases, 7 unilaterally affected cases, and 14 controls were sequenced. Variant calling identified 19.8 million high confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2.8 million insertions/deletions (INDELs). A concordance analysis of SNPs and INDELs requiring all unilateral and bilateral cases and none of the controls to be homozygous for the same allele, revealed two genes, WNT7A and SMARCA4, known to play a role in embryonic hindlimb development. Additionally, SNP alleles in NOTCH1 and RARB were homozygous exclusively in the bilaterally affected cases, suggesting an oligogenic mode of inheritance. Homozygosity mapping by whole genome de novo assembly was then used to identify large contigs representing regions of homozygosity in the cases. This also supported an oligogenic mode of inheritance; implicating 13 genes involved in aberrant hindlimb development in the bilateral cases and 11 in the unilateral cases. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) predicted additional modifier genes. Results from these analyses suggest that mutations in SMARCA4 and WNT7A are required for expression of TH, while several other loci including NOTCH1 act as modifiers and increase the severity of the disease phenotype.

Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of various cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet. 
Methods: Here we characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built up a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis. Further functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore functional interpretation of the genes. With focus on kinase genes, we performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer. We further calculated the expression level of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer. Results: We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analysis, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our work characterized the expression and splicing profile of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1734.pdf,"[( 29 Jun 2016 , 8)]"

The crystal structure of GPER has not yet been determined, and the ligand binding sites have not yet been experimentally identified. The recent explosion of GPCR crystal structures now allow homology modeling with unprecedented reliability. We create, validate, and describe a homology model for GPER. We describe and apply ConDock, the first hybrid scoring function to use information from protein surface conservation and ligand docking, to predict binding sites on GPER for four ligands, estradiol, G1, G15, and tamoxifen. ConDock is a simple product function of sequence conservation and binding energy scores. ConDock predicts that all four ligands bind to the same location on GPER, centered on L119, H307, and N310; this site is deeper in the receptor cleft than are ligand binding sites predicted by previous studies. We compare the sites predicted by ConDock and traditional methods analyzing surface geometry, surface conservation, and ligand chemical interactions.

We present the most extensive MD simulations to date of ER-α; with over 1 μs of combined simulations for the monomer and dimer forms. Simulations reveal that the antagonist-bound complex includes significant fluctuations while the agonist-bound complex is tightly restrained. OHT increases dynamic disorder in the loops located to either side of the tail H12 helix; H12 has been associated with the activation status of ER-α. We also report that fluctuations near H12 lead to greater conformational variation in the binding mode of the ethylamine tail of OHT. Both the agonist and antagonist conformations are stable throughout the 240 ns simulations, supporting the hypothesis that there are no transitions between these two states or into intermediate states. The stable position of H12 in the OHT-bound conformation suggests that OHT stabilizes a well-defined antagonist conformational ensemble rather than merely blocking the agonist-driven activation of ER-α. Simultaneously, the increased dynamic properties of the OHT-bound complex is a potential source of binding entropy.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling/Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling1.pdf,"[( 29 Jun 2016 , 6)]"

Here we present cross-organismic evidence suggesting that most EP pairs are compatible, largely determined by physical proximity rather than specific interactions. By re-analyzing transcriptome datasets, we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size. We experimentally show that non-specific EP interactions can explain such correlation, and that EP distance acts as a scaling factor for the transcriptional influence of an enhancer.

In many cases, these nucleases are engineered to induce a DNA double-strand break (DSB) to stimulate precise genome editing by homologous recombination (HR). However, HR efficiency is nearly always hindered by competing DSB repair pathways such as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR is also profoundly suppressed in non-replicating cells, thus precluding the use of homology-based genome engineering in a wide variety of cell types. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded inhibitor of 53BP1 (known as TP53BP1), a regulator of DSB repair pathway choice. 53BP1 promotes NHEJ over HR by suppressing end resection, the formation of 3-prime single-stranded DNA tails, which is the rate-limiting step in HR initiation. 53BP1 also blocks the recruitment of the HR factor BRCA1 to DSB sites in G1 cells. The inhibitor of 53BP1 (or i53) was identified through the screening of a massive combinatorial library of engineered ubiquitin variants by phage display. i53 binds and occludes the ligand binding site of the 53BP1 Tudor domain with high affinity and selectivity, blocking its ability to accumulate at sites of DNA damage. i53 is a potent selective inhibitor of 53BP1 and enhances gene targeting and chromosomal gene conversion, two HR-dependent reactions. Finally, i53 can also activate HR in G1 cells when combined with the activation of end-resection and KEAP1 inhibition.

A systematic relation between the phase of spontaneous electrophysiological signals, before a stimulus is even presented, and the eventual result of sensory or cognitive processing for that stimulus, would be indicative of an intrinsic periodicity in the underlying neural process. Prior studies of phase-dependent perception have used a variety of analytical methods to measure and evaluate phase differences, and there is currently no established standard practice in this field. The present report intends to remediate this need, by systematically comparing the statistical power of various measures of ""phase opposition"" between two trial groups, in a number of real and simulated experimental situations. Seven measures were evaluated: one parametric test (circular Watson-Williams test), and three distinct measures of phase opposition (phase bifurcation index, phase opposition sum and phase opposition product) combined with two procedures for non-parametric statistical testing (permutation, or a combination of z-score and permutation). While these are obviously not the only existing or conceivable measures, they have all been used in recent studies. All tested methods performed adequately on a previously published dataset (Busch, Dubois & VanRullen, 2009). On a variety of artificially constructed datasets, no single measure was found to surpass all others, but instead the suitability of each measure was contingent on several experimental factors: the time, frequency and depth of oscillatory phase modulation; the absolute and relative amplitudes of post-stimulus event-related potentials for the two trial groups; the absolute and relative trial numbers for the two groups; and the number of permutations used for non-parametric testing. The concurrent use of two phase opposition measures, the parametric Watson-Williams test and a non-parametric test based on summing inter-trial coherence values for the two trial groups, appears to provide the most satisfactory outcome in all situations tested.

Although this verbal memory impairment in SZ is a well-known finding, our understanding about its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms is rather scarce. Here we address this issue by recording brain oscillations during a memory task in a sample of healthy controls and patients suffering from SZ. Brain oscillations represent spectral fingerprints of specific neurocognitive operations and are therefore a promising tool to identify neurocognitive mechanisms that are affected by SZ. Healthy controls showed a prominent suppression of left prefrontal beta oscillatory activity during successful memory formation, which replicates several previous oscillatory memory studies. In contrast, patients failed to exhibit such left prefrontal beta power suppression. Utilizing a new topographical pattern similarity approach, we further demonstrate that the degree of similarity between a patients beta power decrease to that of the controls reliably predicted memory performance. This relationship between beta power decreases and memory was such that the patients memory performance improved as they showed a more similar topographical beta desynchronization pattern compared to that of healthy controls. These findings suggest that left prefrontal beta power suppression (or lack thereof) during memory encoding is a possible biomarker for the observed encoding impairments in SZ in verbal memory.

Here we introduce a novel attentional distribution task to examine the neural mechanisms underlying this process. In this task, participants are presented with an informative cue that indicates the location of an upcoming target. This cue can be perfectly predictive of the exact target location, or it can indicate--with varying degrees of certainty--approximately where the target might appear. This cue is followed by a preparatory period in which there is nothing on the screen except a central fixation cross. Using scalp EEG, we examined neural activity during this preparatory period. We find that with decreasing certainty regarding the precise location of the impending target, participant response times increased while target identification accuracy decreased. Additionally, N1 amplitude in response to the cue parametrically increased with spatial certainty while the multivariate pattern of preparatory period visual cortical alpha (8-12 Hz) activity encoded attentional distribution.

Their high mutation rate readily generates genetic variation contributing to adaptive evolution and human diseases. We recently proposed that short tandem repeats are likely to engage in epistasis because they are well-positioned to compensate for genetic variation arising at other loci due to their high mutation rate. We previously reported that natural ELF3 polyglutamine variants cause reciprocal genetic incompatibilities in two divergent Arabidopsis thaliana backgrounds. Here, we dissected the genetic architecture of this incompatibility and used a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify proteins whose physical interactions with ELF3 were modulated by polyglutamine tract length. Using these two orthogonal approaches, we identify specific genetic interactions and physical mechanisms by which the ELF3 polyglutamine tract may mediate the observed genetic incompatibilities. Our work elucidates how short tandem repeat variation, which is generally underascertained in population-scale sequencing, can contribute to phenotypic variation.

Methods: Cathepsin K expression in OTSCC tissue samples was analyzed with immunostaining; its intracellular traffic was followed in HSC-3 cells after PMA treatment. HSC-3 and two oral keratinocyte cell lines, oral carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and primary gingival fibroblasts (GF) were treated with IL-1α.

Results: Cathepsin K in OTSCC cells was found in vesicles close to cell membrane and within exosomes. While cathepsin K was expressed at the basal level in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, basal IL-1α levels were higher in epithelial cells compared with GFs and CAFs. Cathepsin K expression was slightly induced by IL-1α in all cell lines, but it did not affect HSC-3 invasiveness.

By fitting reinforcement learning models including asocial and/or social decision processes, we measured each individual's (1) asocial exploration tendency and (2) social information use.

This has led to a markedly more extreme distribution of deleterious alleles than seen for any other human population. Compared to populations with much larger population sizes, we see an overall reduction in the number of variable sites, increased numbers of fixed sites, a lower heterozygosity, and increased mean allele frequency as well as more homozygous deleterious genotypes. This means, that the Inuit population is the perfect population to examine the effect of a bottleneck on genetic load. Compared to the European, Asian and African populations, we do not observe a difference in the overall number of derived alleles. In contrast, using proxies for genetic load we find that selection has acted less efficiently in the Inuit, under a recessive model. This fits with our simulations that predict a similar number of derived alleles but a true higher genetic load for the Inuit regardless of the genetic model. Finally, we find that the Inuit population has a great potential for mapping of disease-causing variants that are rare in large populations.

Naturally, the achievable resolution of the estimated fitness effects depends on the specific experimental setup, the organism and type of mutations studied, the sequencing technology utilized, among other factors.
By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. 
Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately as compared with increasing the sequencing depth, or reducing the number of competing mutants.
Even if the duration of the experiment is fixed, sampling more time points and clustering these at the beginning and the end of the experiment increases experimental power, and allows the efficient and precise assessment of the entire range of selection coefficients.

Furthermore, investigation of public prevention measures for ZIKV is essential in order to identify the gaps in mosquito control practices. The aims of this study were to explore the differences in 1) the perception of severity towards ZIKV infection and dengue fever, and 2) mosquito control practices before and after the ZIKV outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Method: Data were collected between February 2015 and May 2016 using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system on a random sample of 567 people from the general Malaysian population aged above 18 years from randomly selected households. Results: The median scale score for perceived severity of ZIKV was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-5) versus 4 (IQR 3-5) for dengue (P<0.001). The majority perceived dengue as being more severe than ZIKV (41.6%). Having friends or acquaintances that had died from dengue was significantly associated with higher perceived severity of ZIKV than dengue (odds ratio [OR] 1.913 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.032-3.547]). The scores for mosquito control practices before and after ZIKV was declared a PHEIC were similar, at 4 (IQR 3-5). Multivariate analysis revealed that participants with a higher score for perception of severity of ZIKV were more likely to report greater mosquito control practices after the declaration of the PHEIC (OR 1.822 [95% CI 1.107-2.998]). Conclusions: The emerging ZIKV pandemic requires concerted efforts to enhance mosquito control practices among the Malaysian public. Efforts to improve public mosquito control practices should focus on enhancing the perception of the severity of ZIKV.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1744.pdf,"[( 01 Jul 2016 , 5), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 02 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

They are managed with a morass of drugs and invasive procedures. In many, their persistent pain occurs after the healing of a soft tissue injury, with a neural source hypothesized. Opiates, commonly used to mitigate their symptoms, can cause an increase in neuropathic pain over time. Current animal models of neuropathic pain commonly create direct neural damage with open surgeries using ligatures, neurectomies, chemicals or other forms of intentional trauma. However, we have observed clinically that after an injury in humans, the naturally occurring process of tissue repair can cause chronic neural pain. We show here how the refined biomimetic NeuroDigm GELTM Model, in the mature male rat, gradually induces neuropathic pain behavior with a nonsurgical percutaneous injection of tissue-derived hydrogel in the tunnel of the distal tibial nerve. This perineural model creates a mononeuritis with the biogenic matrix induction of tissue remodeling, the last stage of tissue repair. Repeated behavioral analgesic testing over 5 months in the model implied a unique predictive validity for all analgesics tested. Morphine, initially effective, had an increase in pain behavior over time, suggesting an opioid-induced hyperalgesia, as seen in humans. Celecoxib produced no analgesia, while gabapentin and duloxetine at low doses had profound analgesia. Histology reveals focal neural remodeling, with neural regeneration, as in human biopsies.

It  can happen  that  due  to  gene mutations, as for  example  when cancer progresses, the gene expression network undergoes some amount of localised re-wiring.  The ability to detect  statistical  relevant  changes  in  the  interaction  patterns induced by  the progression  of the disease  can lead to  discovery of novel relevant signatures.

Several procedures  have been recently proposed  to detect sub-network differences in pairwise labeled  weighted networks. In this paper, we propose  an  improvement  over   the  state-of-the-art  based  on  the Generalized  Hamming Distance  adopted  for evaluating the topological  difference  between   two  networks  and  estimating  its statistical  significance.   The proposed  procedure  exploits a  more effective   model  selection   criteria  to   generate   p-values  for statistical   significance  and   is  more   efficient  in   terms  of computational   time and prediction  accuracy than  literature methods.
Moreover, the structure of the  proposed algorithm allows for a faster parallelized implementation. In the case  of  dense  random geometric networks the proposed  approach is 10-15x faster and achieves 5-10% higher  AUC, Precision/Recall, and Kappa  value  than  the  state-of-the-art.  We  also report the application of  the method to dissect the  difference between the regulatory  networks of IDH-mutant versus  IDH-wild-type glioma cancer.   In such a case  our method  is able  to identify  some recently reported  master regulators  as well  as novel important candidates.

However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers requires functional characterization, typically achieved through reporter assays that test whether a sequence can drive expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter. A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address this question in a systematic manner, we developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2,236 candidate liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated sequences are substantially different from the activities of the identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The results of chromosomally-based reporter assays are also more reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we achieve a Pearson’s R2 of 0.347 for predicting the results of chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models of episomal assays.

However, research in the fNIRS community largely lacks the analytic sophistication of analogous fMRI work, restricting the application of this imaging technology.  The current paper presents a method of multivariate pattern analysis for fNIRS that allows the authors to decode the infant mind (a key fNIRS population).  Specifically, multi-channel pattern analysis (MCPA) employs a correlation-based decoding method where a group model is constructed for all infants except one; both average patterns (i.e., infant-level) and single trial patterns (i.e., trial-level) of activation are decoded. Between subjects decoding is a particularly difficult task, because each infant has their own somewhat idiosyncratic patterns of neural activation. The fact that our method succeeds at across-subject decoding demonstrates the presence of group-level multi-channel regularities across infants.

Pore-water element abundances reflected a rapid transition from abiotic to biotic weathering, the latter associated with lower aqueous loss and higher uptake.

Plants of larger biomass further increased solid fractions, consistent with soil genesis. Mycorrhiza had a generally positive effect on total mobilization.

Here, by orthogonally varying the spatial extent and sound source content of auditory scenes during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording, we report a neural signature of auditory space size perception, starting ~145 ms after stimulus onset. Importantly, this neuromagnetic response is readily dissociable in form and time into representations of the source and its reverberant enclosing space: while the source exhibits an early and transient response, the neural signature of space is sustained and independent of the original source that produced it. Further, the space size response is robust to variations in sound source, and vice versa. The MEG decoding signal was distributed primarily across bilateral temporal sensor locations, significantly correlated with behavioral responses in a separate experiment.

In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation.

Using whole genome deep sequencing data from longitudinal samples during untreated HIV-1 infection, we estimated mutation rates and fitness costs in HIV-1 from the temporal dynamics of genetic variation. At approximately neutral sites, mutations accumulate with a rate of 1.2 x 10-5 per site per day, in agreement with the rate measured in cell cultures. The rate from G to A is largest, followed by the other transitions C to T, T to C, and A to G, while transversions are more rare.  At non-neutral sites, most mutations reduce virus replication; using a model of mutation selection balance, we estimated the fitness cost of mutations at every site in the HIV-1 genome. About half of all nonsynonymous mutations have large fitness costs (greater than 10%), while most synonymous mutations have costs below 1%. The cost of synonymous mutations is especially low in most of gag and pol, while much higher costs are observed in important RNA structures and regulatory regions.

Among the key factors, we took a shot at matrix attachment regions (MARs), translation initiation sites (TIS), signal peptide (SP) sequences, gene optimization and transformation system. Computational analysis of MARs sequences provided enough information about the structure of these sequences and led us to design an artificial MAR sequence considering the essential motifs and underlain rules.

A multi-criteria optimization procedure was performed to redesign the coding sequence of the BAR selectable marker gene. The optimized version of the gene mainly covered the host codon preference, the less structured mRNA and exposure of TIS. As the intragenic factors, we selected an efficient promoter, a 5ˈ-UTR and an intron from the closely related species (Chlamydomonas Sp.) to construct the specific expression vectors. The expression cassettes containing optimized genetic elements could be delivered into the microalgae cells and conferred the resistance to the transformants for at least 90 generations. The findings indicated that the MARs flanking the expression cassette along with the optimized expression elements particularly codon adaptation could potentially improve transformation efficiency and stability.

We investigated the interface between visual and spatial cortical brain regions and report the discovery that a population of neurons in the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex, which we co-recorded with classic head direction cells in a rotationally symmetrical two-compartment environment, were dominated by a local visually defined reference frame and could be decoupled from the main head direction signal. A second population showed rotationally symmetric activity within a single sub-compartment suggestive of an acquired interaction with the head direction cells. These observations reveal an unexpected incoherence within the head direction system, and suggest that dysgranular retrosplenial cortex may mediate between visual landmarks and the multimodal sense of direction. Importantly, it appears that this interface supports a bi-directional exchange of information, which could explain how it is that landmarks can inform the direction sense while at the same time, the direction sense can be used to interpret landmarks.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nature Neuroscience/Nature Neuroscience16.pdf,"[( 22 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 06 Jul 2016 , 5), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 23)]"

The use of predicted allele count for imputed SNPs as the dosage variable is known to produce valid score test for genetic association. Methods: In this paper, we investigate how to best handle imputed SNPs in various modern complex tests for genetic association incorporating gene-environment interactions. We focus on case-control association studies where inference in an underlying logistic regression model can be performed using alternative methods that rely on varying degree on an assumption of gene-environment independence in the underlying population.  As increasingly large scale GWAS are being performed through consortia effort where it is preferable to share only summary-level information across studies, we also describe simple mechanisms for implementing score-tests based on standard meta-analysis of one-step maximum-likelihood estimates across studies. Results: Applications of the methods in simulation studies and a dataset from genome-wide association study of lung cancer illustrate ability of the proposed methods to maintain type-I error rates for underlying testing procedures.  For analysis of imputed SNPs, similar to typed SNPs, retrospective methods can lead to considerable efficiency gain for modeling of gene-environment interactions under the assumption of gene-environment independence.

Previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. Also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. Here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. To achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. Somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in LN. Furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. Interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible.

By contrast, we show that when there is strong natural selection and the population is in linkage disequilibrium, there can be appreciable differences in the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, depending on whether natural selection occurs before or after population regulation in the life cycle.

Using high resolution behavioral tracking of individual flies in different sensory environments, we tested the power law by making maggots trace different trajectory types in naturalistic conditions, from reaching-like movements to scribbles. In all these conditions, we found that the law holds, and also that the exponent of the larval scaling law approaches 3/4, rather than the usual 2/3 exponent found in almost all human situations. This is consistent with recent findings on humans drawing ellipses on water, where dynamic effects related to medium viscosity have been shown to increase the exponent that would emerge from purely kinematic-geometric constraints. To our knowledge, the speed-curvature power law has only been studied in human and non-human primates, our work then being the first demonstration of the speed-curvature scaling principle in other species. As there are still different competing hypotheses for the origin of such law in humans (one invoking complex cortical computations in primates; another postulating its emergence from the coupling of viscoelastic muscle properties with simple central pattern generation) our findings in the larva demonstrate that the law is possible in an animal with a nervous system orders of magnitude simpler than that of humans, thus supporting the latter view. Given that our discovery is in Drosophila (amenable to precise genetic manipulations, electron microscopy reconstruction of neural circuits, imaging in behaving animals, electrophysiology, and other techniques) this opens great potential for uncovering the mechanistic implementation of the velocity-curvature power law. Such scaling laws might exist because natural selection favors processes that remain behaviorally efficient across a wide range of contexts in distantly related species.

Application on both simulated and real-life RNAseq data shows the superior performance of the method compared to other available techniques.

Here we examine the evolution of resistance to sub-MIC concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. First, we show that spontaneous resistance to streptomycin causes an average fitness deficit of ~21% in the absence of drugs; however, these costs are eliminated at concentrations as low as 1/10 the MIC of susceptible strains. Using experimental evolution, we next show that resistance readily evolves at these non-lethal doses. More important, S. coelicolor resistance that evolves at sub-MIC streptomycin is cost-free. Whole-genome analyses reveal that sub-MIC evolved clones fix a distinct set of mutations to those isolated at high drug concentrations. Our results broaden the conditions under which resistance can evolve in nature and suggest that the long-term persistence of these strains is facilitated by the absence of pleiotropic fitness costs.

These patterns influence other aspects of social organization and behavior, and potentially reveal key parts of human nature.  Since the 1860s, anthropologists have sought to characterize prehistoric hunter-gatherers' post-marital residence patterns by extrapolating from modern hunter-gatherers' and chimpanzees' behavior.  For many reasons, these extrapolations are invalid.  I summarized direct evidence of residence patterns from prehistoric hunter-gatherers' remains. Methods I conducted a systematic review of strontium isotope and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and extinct hominins.  I also carried out a systematic review of the reliability of classifying prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals by sex.  To evaluate assumptions underlying my analyses of residence patterns, I reviewed the ethnographic literature on hunter-gatherers' mortuary practices as represented in the eHRAF World Cultures database. Results The archaeologic sites included in my review represent every inhabited continent except Australia, and their dates span almost the last 10,000 years.  In the strontium isotope studies, most adults of both sexes were local, and women were slightly more likely to be local than men. Within sites, women and men had similar mtDNA distributions.  Women in neighboring, contemporaneous communities had somewhat distinct mtDNA distributions from each other, while the mtDNA distributions of men in the different communities were less distinguishable.  The statistical uncertainties for most summaries are fairly large.  Taken together, the results indicate the burial communities were mostly endogamous and that exogamous marriages strained toward matrilocality.  The very limited research on extinct hominins' residence patterns is consistent with these findings.  In addition, there was only a moderate correspondence between morphologic and genetic estimates of sex in adult prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals.  When I corrected for this measurement error or relied on genetic estimates of sex only, the post-marital residence pattern results shifted in the direction of greater matrilocal tendencies.  Modern hunter-gatherers' burial practices were consonant with the assumptions underlying my analyses. Conclusions Direct evidence from prehistoric hunter-gatherers' remains indicates very different post-marital residence patterns than those extrapolated from modern hunter-gatherers' and chimpanzees' behavior.   In prehistoric hunter-gatherer settings, endogamy may be the outcome of humans' long-term mating preferences.  Endogamy may have inhibited bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in prehistory and enabled the evolution of altruism in humans.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1763.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 28 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 20 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 22 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 07 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 06 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 23 Jun 2016 , 1)]"

It conditions the evolutionary trajectory of populations, as well as the rate of adaptive molecular evolution (α). Inference of DFE and α from patterns of polymorphism (SFS) and divergence data has been a longstanding goal of evolutionary genetics. A widespread assumption shared by numerous methods developed so far to infer DFE and α from such data is that beneficial mutations contribute only negligibly to the polymorphism data. Hence, a DFE comprising only deleterious mutations tends to be estimated from SFS data, and α is only predicted by contrasting the SFS with divergence data from an outgroup. Here, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic framework that extends on previous methods and also can infer DFE and α from polymorphism data alone. We use extensive simulations to examine the performance of our method. We show that both a full DFE, comprising both deleterious and beneficial mutations, and α can be inferred without resorting to divergence data. We demonstrate that inference of DFE from polymorphism data alone can in fact provide more reliable estimates, as it does not rely on strong assumptions about a shared DFE between the outgroup and ingroup species used to obtain the SFS and divergence data.

Using simulations, we also present a generalized and realistic scenario where such coupling may arise. This scenario, which we term waveform-dependent CFC, arises when sharp waveforms (e.g., cortical potentials) occur in a periodic manner throughout parts of the data. Since the waveforms are repeated periodically, they constitute a slow wave that is inherently phase-aligned with the high-frequency component carried by the same waveforms. We submit that such behavior of the data, which seems to be present in various cortical signals, cannot be interpreted as reflecting functional modulation between distinct neural sources without additional evidence.

This allowed us to create a metabolic model of the primary community members (Acetobacterium, Sulfurospirillum, and Desulfovibrio). Acetobacterium was the primary carbon fixer, and a keystone member of the community. Based on transcripts upregulated near the electrode surface, soluble hydrogenases and ferredoxins from Acetobacterium and hydrogenases, formate dehydrogenase, and cytochromes of Desulfovibrio were essential conduits for electron flow from the electrode into the electrosynthetic community. A nitrogenase gene cluster with an adjacent ferredoxin and one of two Rnf complexes within the genome of the Acetobacterium were also upregulated on the electrode.  Nitrogenase is known to serve as a hydrogenase, thereby it would contribute to hydrogen production by the biocathode. Oxygenases of microaerobic members of the community throughout the cathode chamber, including Sulfurospirillum and Rhodobacteraceae, were expressed.

We collected and sequenced 45 epipelagic and mesopelagic microbial metagenomes on a meridional transect through the eastern Red Sea. We asked which environmental parameters explain the most variation in relative abundances of taxonomic groups, gene ortholog groups, and pathways -- at a spatial scale of <2000 km, along narrow but well-defined latitudinal and depth-dependent gradients. We also asked how microbes are adapted to gradients and extremes in irradiance, temperature, salinity, and nutrients, examining the responses of individual gene ortholog groups to these parameters. Functional and taxonomic metrics were equally well explained (75-79%) by environmental parameters. However, only functional and not taxonomic covariation patterns were conserved when comparing with an intruding water mass with different physicochemical properties. Temperature explained the most variation in each metric, followed by nitrate, chlorophyll, phosphate, and salinity. That nitrate explained more variation than phosphate suggested nitrogen limitation, consistent with low surface N:P ratios. Covariation of gene ortholog groups with environmental parameters revealed patterns of functional adaptation to the challenging Red Sea environment: high irradiance, temperature, salinity, and low nutrients. Nutrient acquisition gene ortholog groups were anticorrelated with concentrations of their respective nutrient species, recapturing trends previously observed across much larger distances and environmental gradients.

We combined simulations and experiments to study the mechanism of aggregation of two γD-crystallin mutants, W42R and W42Q - the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of age-related oxidative damage.

Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to extrusion of the N-terminal β-hairpin and rearrangement of the native β-sheet topology.

Here, we assessed the contribution of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region important for value-based decision making. We recorded single VMPFC neurons in monkeys performing a task where obtaining fluid rewards required squeezing a grip. The willingness to perform the action was modulated not only by visual information about Effort and Reward levels, but also by contextual factors such as Trial Number (i.e fatigue and/or satiety) or behavior in recent trials. A greater fraction of VMPFC neurons encoded contextual information, compared to visual stimuli. Moreover, the dynamics of VMPFC firing was more closely related to slow changes in motivational states driven by these contextual factors rather than rapid responses to individual task events. Thus, the firing of VMPFC neurons continuously integrated contextual information and reliably predicted the monkeys willingness to perform the task. This function might be critical when animals forage in a complex environment and need to integrate information over time.

A prominent example is the hierarchical structure of tissues with high cell turnover, where a small number of tissue specific stem cells produces a large number of specialised progeny during multiple differentiation steps. 
Another well known mechanism is the spatial organisation of stem cell populations and it is thought that this organisation suppresses fitness enhancing mutations.  
However, in small populations the suppression of advantageous mutations typically also implies an increased accumulation of deleterious mutations.  
Thus, it becomes an important question whether the suppression of potentially few advantageous mutations outweighs the combined effects of many deleterious mutations.  
We argue that the distribution of mutant fitness effects, e.g. the probability to hit a strong driver compared to many deleterious mutations, is crucial for the optimal organisation of a cancer suppressing tissue architecture and should
be taken into account in arguments for the evolution of such tissues. 
We show that for systems that are composed of few cells reflecting the typical organisation of a stem cell niche, amplification or suppression of selection can arise from subtle changes in the architecture.

Fredrickson et al. 2015 used a linear model of fixed effects with correlated error (using GLS) to estimate the partial regression coefficients. The standardized effects of hedonic and eudaimonic happiness on CTRA gene set expression estimated by GLS was compared to estimates using multivariate (OLS) linear models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. The OLS estimates were tested using a bootstrap t-test, O'Brien's OLS test, a permutation t test, and the rotation z-test. The GEE estimates were tested using a Wald test with robust standard errors. The performance (type I, type II, and type M error) of all tests was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation of data modeled after the 2015 dataset. Standardized OLS effects (mean partial regression coefficients) of Hedonia and Eudaimonia on gene expression levels are very small in both the 2013 and 2015 data, as well as the combined data.The p-values from all tests fail to reject any of the null models. The GEE estimates and tests are nearly identical to the OLS estimates and tests. By contrast, the GLS estimates are inconsistent between data sets, but in each dataset, at least one coefficient is large and highly statistically significant. The Monte Carlo simulation of error rates shows inflated type I error from the GLS test on data with a similar correlation structure to that in the 2015 dataset, and this error rate increases as the number of outcomes increases relative to the number of subjects. Bootstrap and permutation GLS distributions suggest that the GLS model not only results in downward biased standard errors but also inflated coefficients. Both distributions also show the expected, strong, negative correlation between the coefficients for Hedonia and Eudaimonia. The results fail to support opposing effects, or any detectable effect, of hedonic and eudaimonic well being on the pattern of gene expression. The apparently replicated pattern of hedonic and eudaimonic effects on gene expression is most parsimoniously explained as ""correlated noise"" due to the geometry of multiple regression.

In the present study, the effects of n-butanol on the cell envelope of Escherichia coli were investigated. Using enzyme and fluorescence-based assays, we observed that 1% v/v n-butanol resulted in release of lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of E. coli and caused leakiness in both outer and inner membranes. Higher concentrations of n-butanol, within the range of 2% - 10% (v/v), resulted in inner membrane protrusion through the peptidoglycan observed by characteristic blebs.

The ZIKV Asiatic strain was probably introduced into Brazil in 2013. In the current critical human epidemic in the Americas, ZIKV is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, especially where the human population density is combined with poor sanitation. Presently, ZIKV is in contact with the rich biodiversity in all Brazilian biomes, bordering on other Latin American countries.

The evolutionary dynamics of these mutation rate modifiers are determined by indirect selection on linked beneficial and deleterious mutations. These indirect selection pressures have been the focus of much earlier theoretical and empirical work, but we still have a limited analytical understanding of how the interplay between hitchhiking and deleterious load influences the fates of modifier alleles. Our understanding is particularly limited when clonal interference is common, which is the regime of primary interest in laboratory microbial evolution experiments. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of a mutator or antimutator allele in a rapidly adapting asexual population, and we show how this quantity depends on the population size, the beneficial and deleterious mutation rates, and the strength of a typical driver mutation. In the absence of deleterious mutations, we find that clonal interference enhances the fixation probability of mutators, even as they provide a diminishing benefit to the overall rate of adaptation. When deleterious mutations are included, natural selection pushes the population towards a stable mutation rate that can be suboptimal for the adaptation of the population as a whole. The approach to this stable mutation rate is not necessarily monotonic, and selection can favor mutator and antimutator alleles that overshoot the stable mutation rate by substantial amounts.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics92.pdf,"[( 09 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 08 Jul 2016 , 19), ( 10 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Thus, uncovering molecular changes that can be targeted to lessen withdrawal symptoms is key to breaking the cycle of dependence. Using the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we tested whether one highly conserved ethanol target, the BK potassium channel, may play a major role in alcohol withdrawal. Consistent with a previous report, we found that C. elegans displays behavioral impairment during withdrawal from chronic ethanol that can be reduced by low-dose ethanol. We discovered that the degree of impairment is exacerbated in worms lacking the BK channel, SLO-1, and is alleviated by selective rescue of the BK channel in the nervous system. Conversely, behavioral impairment during withdrawal was dramatically lower in worms with BK channel function enhanced via gain-of-function mutation or overexpression. Consistent with these results, we found that chronic ethanol exposure decreased BK channel expression in a subset of neurons. In addition, we found that a distinct, conserved large-conductance potassium channel, SLO-2, showed the inverse functional relationship, influencing withdrawal behavior via a SLO-1 channel-dependent mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that withdrawal symptoms in C. elegans are mechanistically explained in part by a functional imbalance in the nervous system associated with a reduction in SLO-1 channel expression.

However, the proximal neural mechanisms driving dog-human social interaction are unknown. We used fMRI in 15 awake dogs to probe the neural basis for their preferences for social interaction and food reward. In a first experiment, we used the ventral caudate as a measure of intrinsic reward value and compared activation to conditioned stimuli that predicted food, praise, or nothing. Relative to the control stimulus, the caudate was significantly more active to the reward-predicting stimuli and showed roughly equal or greater activation to praise versus food in 13 of 15 dogs. To confirm that these differences were driven by the intrinsic value of social praise, we performed a second imaging experiment in which the praise was withheld on a subset of trials. The difference in caudate activation to the receipt of praise, relative to its withholding, was strongly correlated with the differential activation to the conditioned stimuli in the first experiment. In a third experiment, we performed an out-of-scanner choice task in which the dog repeatedly selected food or owner in a Y-maze. The relative caudate activation to food- and praise-predicting stimuli in Experiment 1 was a strong predictor of each dog's sequence of choices in the Y-maze. Analogous to similar neuroimaging studies of individual differences in human social reward, our findings demonstrate a neural mechanism for preference in domestic dogs that is stable within, but variable between, individuals. Moreover, the individual differences in the caudate responses indicate the potentially higher value of social than food reward for some dogs and may help to explain the apparent efficacy of social interaction in dog training.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Social Cognitive And Affective Neuroscience/Social Cognitive And Affective Neuroscience1.pdf,"[( 22 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 20 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 30 May 2017 , 1), ( 11 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 31 May 2017 , 2), ( 08 Jul 2016 , 10), ( 18 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 10 Jul 2016 , 6), ( 13 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 02 Sep 2016 , 5), ( 03 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 23 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 27 Jan 2017 , 1), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 04 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 16 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 3)]"

Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to model the DNA-binding specificity of TFs, they still have some limitations. Most of the methods require a cut-off threshold in order to classify a K-mer as a binding site (BS) and finding such a threshold is usually done by handcraft rather than a science. Some other approaches use a prior knowledge on the biological context of regulatory elements in the genome along with machine learning algorithms to build classifier models for TFBSs. Noticeably, these methods deliberately select the training and testing datasets so that they are very separable. Hence, the current methods do not actually capture the TF-DNA binding relationship. In this paper, we present a threshold-free framework based on a novel ensemble learning algorithm in order to locate TFBSs in DNA sequences. Our proposed approach creates TF-specific classifier models using genome-wide DNA-binding experiments and a prior biological knowledge on DNA sequences and TF binding preferences. Systematic background filtering algorithms are utilized to remove non-functional K-mers from training and testing datasets. To reduce the complexity of classifier models, a fast feature selection algorithm is employed. Finally, the created classifier models are used to scan new DNA sequences and identify potential binding sites.

detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor)
in the 3-10~nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry,
molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses
the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected
by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of
donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance
between the two fluorophores.

While recent years have seen a growing number of contributions 
proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, 
rarely have those publications been accompanied by software implementation. 
In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete 
software package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date.
 
In this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software
for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data.
FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts
analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques,
while providing an open, robust and well-documented implementation.
Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison
and development of new methods in burst analysis.

We employ modern software engineering principles in order to
minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability.
Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on
Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution.
Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the
analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can
be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes.
Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows
and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs.
By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, 
FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows
and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration
among researchers in the single-molecule community.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE151.pdf,"[( 11 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 18 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 09 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 10 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 20 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

Moreover, the majority of GSE analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions.
Results: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) is a method developed for RNA-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. redEGSEA's gene set database contains around 25,000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. EGSEA has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse data sets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined.

Here we use new data and analyses to respond to the main points of this critique.  First, a central argument of the critique was that short-term time series lead to biased estimates of long-term biodiversity change.  However, we show here that this conclusion was based entirely on two fundamental mistakes in the simulations used to support it.  Second, we show that the critic's conclusion that there are negative relationships between temporal biodiversity change and study duration is entirely dependent on: (i) the unrealistic assumption that biodiversity change can be positive when study duration = 0; (ii) the use of only a subset of the available data; (iii) inclusion of a single outlier data point in a single study (out of 100 in this case); and/or (iv) a choice to use log ratios rather than slopes (when available) as the metric of temporal biodiversity change.  In short, the evidence does not support the conclusion that studies of longer duration tend to find local diversity decline.  Finally, the critique highlighted the obviously true fact that studies in the ecological literature represent a geographically biased sample of locations on Earth; this issue was noted in both original papers, and is relevant for all ecological data syntheses.  This fact was used by the critics to cast doubt on our conclusion that, outside of areas converted to croplands or asphalt, the distribution of temporal biodiversity trends is centered on zero.  As a scientific rule, future studies based on more or different data may cause us to modify our conclusion, but at present, alternative conclusions based on the geographic-bias argument rely entirely on speculation.  In sum, the critique raises points of uncertainty typical of all ecological studies, but it falls far short of providing an evidence-based alternative interpretation for our results, which are now supported by syntheses of hundreds of individual data sets of temporal biodiversity change.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Ecology/Ecology3.pdf,"[( 09 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 08 Jul 2016 , 5), ( 29 Aug 2016 , 5), ( 06 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 10 Jul 2016 , 4)]"

Some propose we should disarm rather than kill bacteria, through targeted disruption of their virulence factors. It is assumed that this approach (i) induces weak selection for resistance because it should only minimally impact bacterial fitness, and (ii) is specific, only interfering with the virulence factor in question. Given that pathogenicity emerges from complex interactions between pathogens, hosts, and their environment, such assumptions may be unrealistic. To address this issue in a test case, we conducted experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where we manipulated the availability of a virulence factor, the iron-scavenging pyoverdine, within the insect host Galleria mellonella. We observed that pyoverdine availability was not stringently predictive of virulence, and affected bacterial fitness in non-linear ways. We show that this complexity could partly arise because pyoverdine availability affects host responses and alters the expression of regulatorily linked virulence factors. Our results reveal that virulence-factor manipulation feeds back on pathogen and host behavior, which in turn affects virulence. Our findings highlight that realizing effective and evolutionarily robust anti-virulence therapies will ultimately require deeper engagement with the intrinsic complexity of host-pathogen systems.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolutionary Applications/Evolutionary Applications4.pdf,"[( 12 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 08 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 16 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 11 Jul 2016 , 3)]"

Here we uncover an unanticipated link between ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) and the expression of target genes undergoing extensive 3′UTR editing. Using METTL7A (Methyltransferase Like 7A), a novel tumor suppressor as an exemplary target gene, we demonstrate that its expression could be repressed by ADARs beyond their RNA editing and dsRNA binding functions. ADARs interact with Dicer to augment the processing of pre-miR-27a to mature miR-27a. Consequently, mature miR-27a targets the METTL7A 3′UTR to repress its expression level. In sum, our study unveils that the extensive 3′UTR editing is merely a footprint of ADAR binding, and is dispensable for the regulation of at least a subset of target genes. Instead, ADARs contribute to cancer progression by regulating cancer-related gene expression through their non-canonical functions independent of RNA editing and dsRNA binding. The functional significance of ADARs is much more diverse than previously appreciated and this gene regulatory function of ADARs is most likely to be of higher importance than the best-studied editing function. This novel non-editing side of ADARs opens another door to target cancer.

One important next step is to further our understanding on the role of activity-dependent changes of genes expression in the etiopathogenesis of SCZ. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether neuronal activity-dependent changes of gene expression is dysregulated in SCZ. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from 4 cases with SCZ and 4 unaffected controls were depolarized using potassium chloride. RNA was extracted followed by genome-wide profiling of the transcriptome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We performed differential expression analysis and gene co-expression analysis to identify activity-dependent or disease-specific changes of the transcriptome. Further, we used gene set analyses to identify co-expressed modules that are enriched for SCZ risk genes. RESULTS: We identified 1,669 genes that are significantly different in SCZ-associated vs. control hiPSC-derived neurons and 1,199 genes that are altered in these cells in response to depolarization. We show that the effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in SCZ-associated neurons is attenuated compared to controls. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes are co-expressed in modules that are highly enriched for genes affected by genetic risk variants in SCZ and other neurodevelopmental disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results show that SCZ candidate genes converge to gene networks that are associated with a blunted effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in SCZ-associated neurons. Overall, these findings show that hiPSC neurons demonstrate activity-dependent transcriptional changes that can be utilized to examine underlying mechanisms and therapeutic interventions related to SCZ.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1775.pdf,"[( 09 Jul 2016 , 10)]"

Three dams were erected on the Skagit River in northern-central Washington state between 1924 and 1953 and subsequently changed the natural shape and movement of the Skagit River and its tributaries. We collected 183 individuals from 13 tributaries and generated a dataset of >2,500 loci (unlinked SNPs) using double digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) identified ~99% of the genetic variation within groups, and the remaining variation among groups separated by dams, or the Skagit River. All populations exhibited low FST values with a maximum of 0.03474. A ""de novo"" discriminant analysis of principal components revealed two populations with no geographic cohesiveness. However, testing groups that were partitioned a priori by the dams revealed distinctiveness of populations down-river of the lowest dam. Coalescent-based analyses of recent migration suggest that up to 17.3% of each population is composed of migrants from other populations, and an estimation of effective migration rates revealed high levels of migration heterogeneity and population connectivity in this area. Our results suggest that although the populations down-river from the lowest dam are distinguishable, a high level of A. truei population connectivity exists throughout the North Cascades National Park Service Complex.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1776.pdf,"[( 09 Jul 2016 , 6)]"

translational attenuation reported in SufI protein in E. coli. Furthermore, we

better explained by a big change in the pause propensity due to the synonymous bicodon

The forkhead box transcription factor gene FOXC1 is an important developmental regulator in the generation of mesenchymal cells necessary in the formation of the anterior segment of the eye, the craniofacial skeleton and the meninges. Recently elevated expression of FOXC1 has been detected in several metastatic cancers that have undergone EMT events.  We sought to determine the role of FOXC1 in the initiation of EMT events using NMuMG cells treated with TFGβ1.  We found that although Foxc1 expression was increased following TFGβ1 induced EMT, Foxc1 was not required for this induction.  Instead we propose that Foxc1 is required for the specification of the mesenchyme cell type, promoting an activated fibroblast phenotype over a myofibroblast phenotype following the initiation of EMT. This cells type specification was achieved through the regulation of Fibroblast growth factor (Fgfr) 1 expression.  Using an RNA sequencing approach, we determined that levels of Fgfr1 normally activated upon TFGβ1 treatment were reduced in Foxc1-knockdown cells.  Through chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments we determined that FOXC1 could bind to an Fgfr1 upstream regulatory region. Furthermore, expression of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) was elevated in Foxc1 knockdown cells.  Finally we determined that FGF2 mediated three dimensional migratory ability was greatly impaired in Foxc1-knockdown cells.

The Mouse Genomes Project is an ongoing collaborative effort to sequence the genomes of the common laboratory mouse strains. In 2011, the initial analysis of sequence variation across 17 strains found 56.7M unique SNPs and 8.8M indels. We carry out deep sequencing of 13 additional inbred strains (BUB/BnJ, C57BL/10J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, DBA/1J, I/LnJ, KK/HiJ, MOLF/EiJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, RF/J, SEA/GnJ and ST/bJ), cataloging molecular variation within and across the strains. These strains include important models for immune response, leukemia, age-related hearing loss and rheumatoid arthritis. We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes.

Results
Approximately, 27.4M unique SNPs and 5M indels are identified across these strains compared to the C57BL/6J reference genome (GRCm38). The amount of variation found in the inbred laboratory mouse genome has increased to 71M SNPs and 12M indels. We investigate the genetic basis of highly penetrant cancer susceptibility in RF/J finding private novel missense mutations in DNA damage repair and highly cancer associated genes. We use two highly related strains (DBA/1J and DBA/2J) to investigate the genetic basis of collagen induced arthritis susceptibility.

Conclusion 
This paper significantly expands the catalog of fully sequenced laboratory mouse strains and now contains several examples of highly genetically similar strains with divergent phenotypes.

However, both the time and place of admixture in Europe are obscure and subject to intense debate. Here, we attempt to characterize the Ashkenazi admixture history using a large Ashkenazi sample and careful application of new and existing methods. Our main approach is based on local ancestry inference, assigning each Ashkenazi genomic segment as EU or ME, and comparing allele frequencies across EU segments to those of different EU populations. The contribution of each EU source was also evaluated using GLOBETROTTER and analysis of IBD sharing. The time of admixture was inferred using multiple tools, relying on statistics such as the distributions of segment lengths and the total EU ancestry per chromosome and the correlation of ancestries along the chromosome. Our simulations demonstrated that distinguishing EU vs ME ancestry is subject to considerable noise at the single segment level, but nevertheless, conclusions could be drawn based on chromosome-wide statistics. The predominant source of EU ancestry in AJ was found to be Southern European (≈60-80%), with the rest being likely Eastern European. The inferred admixture time was ≈35 generations ago, but multiple lines of evidence suggests that it represents an average over two or more admixture events, pre- and post-dating the founder event experienced by AJ in late medieval times.

Here, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the dynamics of adaptation and substitution over all mutation-rate regimes by conceptualizing the population as a collection of continuously adapting lineages. This model of “lineage interference” shows that each new mutant’s advantage over the rest of the population must be above a critical threshold in order to likely achieve fixation, and we derive a simple expression for that threshold.

Here we explore the role of cell proliferation across 19 cancers (n=6,581 patients) using tissue-based RNA sequencing from The Cancer Genome Atlas project by employing a ""proliferative index"" derived from gene expression associated with PCNA expression. This proliferative index is significantly associated with patient survival (Cox, p-value<0.05) in 7/19 cancers, which we have defined as ""proliferation-informative cancers"" (PICs). In PICs the proliferative index is strongly correlated with tumor stage and nodal invasion. PICs paradoxically demonstrate reduced baseline expression of proliferation machinery relative to non-PICs suggesting that non-PICs saturate their proliferative capacity early in tumor development and allow other factors to dictate prognostic outcomes. We also identify chemotherapies whose efficacy is correlated with proliferation index and highlight drugs capable of inhibiting proliferation associated expression. Additionally, we find that proliferative index is significantly associated with gross somatic mutation burden (Spearman, p=1.76x10-23) as well mutations in individual driver genes.

Here we applied oxidative bisulfite sequencing to generate whole-genome DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation maps at single-base resolution in paired human liver and lung normal and cancer. We found that 5hmC is significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shores while depleted in CGIs themselves, in particular at active genes, resulting in a 5hmC but not 5mC bimodal distribution around CGI corresponding to H3K4me1 marks. Hydroxymethylation on promoters, gene bodies, and transcription termination regions showed strong positive correlation with gene expression within and across tissues, suggesting that 5hmC is a mark of active genes and could play a role gene expression mediated by DNA demethylation. Comparative analysis of methylomes and hydroxymethylomes revealed that 5hmC is significantly enriched in both tissue specific DMRs (t-DMRs) and cancer specific DMRs (c-DMRs), and 5hmC is negatively correlated with methylation changes, particularly in non-CGI associated DMRs.

We provide for the first time a new method called adaptive local realignment that automatically uses diverse parameter settings in different regions of the input sequences when computing multiple sequence alignments. This allows parameter settings to adapt to more closely match the local mutation rate across a protein.

Method: Our method builds on our prior work on global alignment parameter advising with the Facet alignment accuracy estimator. Given a computed alignment, in each region that has low estimated accuracy, a collection of candidate realignments is generated using a precomputed set of alternate parameter settings. If one of these alternate realignments has higher estimated accuracy than the original subalignment, the region is replaced with the new realignment, and the concatenation of these realigned regions forms the final alignment that is output.

Results: Adaptive local realignment significantly improves the quality of alignments over using the single best default parameter setting. In particular, this new method of local advising, when combined with prior methods for global advising, boosts alignment accuracy by as much as 26% over the best default setting on hard-to-align benchmarks (and by 6.4% over using global advising alone).

To explore the patterns of local adaptation along latitudinal and longitudinal clines, we used thirty-four populations of Salix eriocephala sourced from its natural ranges across Canada. The genotypes were examined for 6 phenology and 19 ecophysiology traits over two growing seasons under common garden condition. Photosynthetic assimilation rate (A) increased with increase in latitude when measured during free growth. In spite, the negative correlation between stomatal density and stomatal conductance (gs), higher A is facilitated via larger pore length among genotypes from short growing seasons. In addition, higher A, was positively associated with total leaf nitrogen and leaf mass per unit area. No population level differences were observed for water use-efficiency (Δ13C), however nitrogen isotope discrimination (δ15N) displayed latitudinal clines. Growing season phenological traits considered in this study accounted high heritability (H2 = 0.65-0.94). Melampsora rust infestation also displayed a strong latitudinal cline with high-latitude genotypes being more susceptible. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that functional trait variations are largely explained by climate of origin and facilitate selection of parents with superior adaptive traits in the Canadian willow improvement program for bioenergy and environmental applications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1785.pdf,"[( 11 Jul 2016 , 6)]"

In this paper, we revisit the effects of shared predation, i.e. the situation in which two prey are consumed by a common predator. Such predation usually induces negative indirect interactions between prey, or apparent competition, through an increase of predator density and thus of predation pressure. Two mechanisms can however weaken apparent competition and lead to equivocal signs of indirect interactions. On the one hand, predator distraction, which stems from the difficulty to efficiently forage for different prey at the same moment in time and diminishes the number of prey captured per predator. On the other hand, predator negative density dependence limits predator growth. To get further insights into simple rules describing indirect interactions brought about by shared predation, we studied two classes of one-predator--two-prey models exhibiting these two mechanisms. We found robust simple rules derived from predator equilibria which state that at least one prey is favored by the presence of the other when the predators partition their foraging effort between them. These rules thus characterize a surprising wide range of indirect effects including apparent predation, apparent commensalism and apparent mutualism.

Results: The ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.

This was partly motivated by observations in Kolling et al. (2012) [KBMR] that these choice types are subserved by different circuits, with dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) preferentially involved in foraging and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) preferentially involved in economic choice. To support this account, KBMR used fMRI to scan human subjects making either a foraging choice (between exploiting a current offer or swapping for potentially better rewards) or an economic choice (between two reward-probability pairs). This study found that dACC better tracked values pertaining to foraging, while vmPFC better tracked values pertaining to economic choice. We recently showed that dACC's role in these foraging choices is better described by the difficulty of choosing than by foraging value, when correcting for choice biases and testing a sufficiently broad set of foraging values (Shenhav et al., 2014). Here, we extend these findings in three ways. First, we replicate our original finding with a larger sample and a task modified to address remaining methodological gaps between our previous experiments and that of KBMR.

Here, we find that this passaging leaves distinct signals of adaptation in the viral sequences, which can confound evolutionary analyses of the viral sequences. We find distinct patterns of adaptation to Madin-Darby (MDCK) and monkey cell culture absent from unpassaged hemagglutinin sequences. These patterns also dominate pooled datasets not separated by passaging type, and they increase in proportion to the number of passages performed. By contrast, MDCK-SIAT1 passaged sequences seem mostly (but not entirely) free of passaging adaptations. Contrary to previous studies, we find that using only internal branches of the influenza phylogenetic trees is insufficient to correct for passaging artifacts.

With data in the cloud, it becomes possible for scientists to take their tools to the data and thereby avoid large data transfers. It also becomes feasible to scale computing resources to the needs of a given analysis. To evaluate this concept, we quantified transcript-expression levels for 12,307 RNA-Sequencing samples from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas.

While this ecosystem undergoes a range of seasonal variation, it experienced a large shift in salinity (230 to 65 g kg-1) during 2011-2012 following the landfall of Hurricane Irene on San Salvador Island. High throughput sequencing and analysis of 16S rRNA and rRNA genes from samples before and after the pulse disturbance showed significant changes in the diversity and activity of abundant and rare taxa, suggesting overall functional and compositional sensitivity to environmental change.

Broadly, following the post-disturbance reduction in salinity, taxa within Halobacteria decreased while those within Crenarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Thermoplasmata, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria, increased in abundance and activity. Quantitative PCR of genes and transcripts involved in nitrogen and sulfur cycling showed concomitant shifts in biogeochemical cycling potential.

Although speeding up individual components of a sequence analysis pipeline (e.g. read mapping) can reduce the computational cost of analysis, such approaches do not take full advantage of the particulars of a given problem. One problem of great interest, genotyping a known set of variants (e.g. dbSNP or Affymetrix SNPs), is important for characterization of known genetic traits and causative disease variants within an individual, as well as the initial stage of many ancestral and population genomic pipelines (e.g. GWAS).
Results: We introduce LAVA (Lightweight Assignment of Variant Alleles), an NGS-based genotyping algorithm for a given set of SNP loci, which takes advantage of the fact that approximate matching of mid-size k-mers (with k = 32) can typically uniquely identify loci in the human genome without full read alignment. LAVA accurately calls the vast majority of SNPs in dbSNP and Affymetrix's Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 up to about an order of magnitude faster than standard NGS genotyping pipelines. For Affymetrix SNPs, LAVA has significantly higher SNP calling accuracy than existing pipelines while using as low as ∼5GB of RAM. As such, LAVA represents a scalable computational method for population-level genotyping studies as well as a flexible NGS-based replacement for SNP arrays.

Technically, the selection coefficient is estimated by means of a likelihood function built under the hypothesis that the available trajectory spans a sufficiently large portion of the fitness landscape. Especially for ancient DNA, however, often only one single such trajectories is available and the coverage of the fitness landscape is very limited. In fact, one single trajectory is more representative of a process conditioned both in the initial and in the final condition than of a process free to visit the available fitness landscape. Based on two models of population genetics, here we show how to build a likelihood function for the selection coefficient that takes the statistical peculiarity of single trajectories into account. We show that this conditional likelihood delivers a precise estimate of the selection coefficient also when allele frequencies are close to fixation whereas the unconditioned likelihood fails.

We quantified female offspring provisioning rates before and during playbacks and plasma corticosterone levels (cort) once during late incubation and once immediately after playbacks. Females in both populations increased feeding rates temporarily during the first two hours of playback but the increase was not sustained for the entire duration of playback (six hours). Cort levels from samples at the end of the playback did not differ between control females and females that received playbacks.

However, the vast majority of atopics do not develop asthma-related wheeze, despite ongoing exposure to aeroallergens to which they are strongly sensitized, indicating that additional pathogenic mechanism(s) operate in conjunction with Th2 immunity to drive asthma pathogenesis.
Objectives: Employ systems level analyses to identify inflammation-associated gene networks operative at baseline in sputum-derived RNA from house dust mite-sensitized  (HDMS) subjects with/without wheezing history; identify networks characteristic of the ongoing asthmatic state. All subjects resided in the constitutively-HDMhigh Perth environment.
Methods: Genome wide expression profiling by RNASeq followed by gene coexpression network analysis. 
Measurements/Results: HDMS-nonwheezers displayed baseline gene expression in sputum including IL-5, IL-13 and CCL17. HDMS-wheezers showed equivalent expression of these classical Th2-effector genes but their overall baseline sputum signatures were more complex, comprising hundreds of Th2-associated and epithelial-associated genes, networked into two separate coexpression modules. The first module was connected by the hubs EGFR, ERBB2, CDH1 and IL-13. The second module was associated with CDHR3, and contained genes that control mucociliary clearance. 
Conclusions: Our findings provide new insight into the inflammatory mechanisms operative at baseline in the airway mucosal microenvironment in atopic asthmatics undergoing natural perennial aeroallergen exposure. The molecular mechanism(s) that determine susceptibility to asthma amongst these subjects involve interactions between Th2- and epithelial function-associated genes within a complex co-expression network, which is not operative in equivalently sensitized/exposed atopic non-asthmatics.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1791.pdf,"[( 13 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 14 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

This is particularly exemplified by giant pandas in whom the transition from colostrum to main-phase lactation is unusually prolonged. To examine whether there is compensation for the provision of developmentally important nutrients that other species groups may provide in utero, we examined colostrum and milk lipids from birth until the transition was complete. Lipids known to be developmental signals or their precursors, and those that are fundamental to nervous system construction, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and phosphatidylserines containing DHA, appear early and then fall dramatically in concentration to a baseline at about 20 days. This also applies to other signalling lipids such as lysophosphatidylserines. The dynamics of lysophosphatidic acid and eicosanoids display a similar pattern, albeit less clearly and with differences between mothers. Triglycerides occur at relatively low levels initially and then increase in concentration with time post-partum until a plateau is reached at about 30 days or later. These patterns indicate an early provision of signalling lipids and their precursors, and lipids crucial to brain, retinal and central nervous system construction, followed by a changeover to lipids for energy metabolism. Thus, in giant pandas, and possibly among ursids in general, lactation is adapted to provisioning a highly altricial neonate to a degree that approximates to an extension of gestation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports113.pdf,"[( 13 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Here, we identify Rspo1 as a mediator of skeletal muscle tissue repair. Firstly we show that Rspo1-null muscles do not display any abnormalities at the basal level. However deletion of Rspo1 results in global alteration of muscle regeneration kinetics following acute injury. We found that muscle stem cells lacking Rspo1 show delayed differentiation. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that Rspo1 is required for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes in muscle cells. Furthermore, muscle cells lacking Rspo1 fuse with a higher frequency than normal cells, leading to larger myotubes containing more nuclei both in vitro and in vivo. We found the increase in muscle fusion was dependent on up-regulation of non-canonical Wnt7a/Fzd7/Rac1 signaling.

The unpaired copies exhibit a clear repression at the transcriptional level relative to paired gene dosage effect, which is dependent upon long noncoding RNA, Polycomb and piwi. Deficiency mapping using Adh-w constructs showed that a minimal sequence of 532 bp of the Adh promoter is required for unpaired DNA silencing. Long noncoding RNA detected from this region of the Adh promoter is abundant in the unpaired condition. It serves as a docking site for at least two proteins POLYCOMB and Piwi that are essential for active transcriptional silencing. The lesser abundance of noncoding RNAs in the paired configuration only allows PC binding. An active RNA-Protein complex binds to unpaired copies. The loss-of-function piwi mutation relieves transcriptional silencing even in association with POLYCOMB. It suggests that functional RNA-Piwi complex might create a silencing driven chromatin configuration by accumulating histone modifying enzymes at the Adh-w promoter target.

A promising approach that runs parallel to explicitly validating individual genes is analyzing a set of genes together and assessing the biological similarities among them. This is often achieved via gene ontology (GO) analysis, a powerful tool that involves evaluating publicly available gene annotations.

Barcoding methods are of particular importance in large-scale surveys as they promote fast species discovery and biodiversity estimates. Among those, distance-based methods are the most common choice as they scale well with large datasets; however, they are sensitive to similarity threshold parameters and they ignore evolutionary relationships. The recently introduced 'Poisson Tree Processes' (PTP) method is a phylogeny-aware approach that does not rely on such thresholds. Yet, two weaknesses of PTP impact its accuracy and practicality when applied to large datasets; it does not account for divergent intraspecific variation and is slow for a large number of sequences.

We introduce the multi-rate PTP (mPTP), an improved method that alleviates the theoretical and technical shortcomings of PTP. It incorporates different levels of intraspecific genetic diversity deriving from differences in either the evolutionary history or sampling of each species. Results on empirical data suggest that mPTP is superior to PTP and popular distance-based methods as it, consistently, yields more accurate delimitations with respect to the taxonomy (i.e., identifies more taxonomic species, infers species numbers closer to the taxonomy). Moreover, mPTP does not require any similarity threshold as input. The novel dynamic programming algorithm attains a speedup of at least five orders of magnitude compared to PTP, allowing it to delimit species in large (meta-) barcoding data. In addition, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provides a comprehensive evaluation of the inferred delimitation in just a few seconds for millions of steps, independently of tree size.

Whole genome sequencing of sixty-eight outbreak and archival isolates of S. sonnei was performed to investigate the microbiological factors related to these outbreaks. Both SD/SJ and SF populations, as well as almost all of the archival S. sonnei isolates belonged to sequence type 152 (ST152).  Genome-wide SNP analysis clustered the majority of California (CA) isolates to an earlier described global Lineage III, which has persisted in CA since 1986.

However, the STX genes (stx1a and stx1b) from this novel phage had sequences most similar to the phages from S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae.  The isolates in the SF population yielded evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance acquired via the accumulation of point mutations in gyrA and parC genes.

The mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) is a major vector of viral diseases like dengue fever, Zika and chikungunya. Aedes aegypti exhibits high morphological and behavioral variation, some of which is thought to be of epidemiological significance. Globally distributed domestic Ae. aegypti have been traditionally grouped into (i) the very pale variety queenslandensis and (ii) the type form. Because the two color forms co-occur across most of their range, there is interest in understanding how freely they interbreed. This knowledge is particularly important for control strategies that rely on mating compatibilities between the release and target mosquitoes, such as Wolbachia releases and SIT. To answer this question, we analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial genome-wide variation in the co-occurring pale and type Ae. aegypti from northern Queensland (Australia) and Singapore. 
Methods/Findings
We typed 74 individuals at a 1170 bp-long mitochondrial sequence and at 16,569 nuclear SNPs using a customized double-digest RAD sequencing. 11/29 genotyped individuals from Singapore and 11/45 from Queensland were identified as var. queenslandensis based on the diagnostic scaling patterns. We found 24 different mitochondrial haplotypes, seven of which were shared between the two forms. Multivariate genetic clustering based on nuclear SNPs corresponded to individuals' geographic location, not their color. Several family groups consisted of both forms and three queenslandensis individuals were Wolbachia infected, indicating previous breeding with the type form which has been used to introduce Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations.
Conclusion
Aedes aegypti queenslandensis are genomically indistinguishable from the type form, which points to these forms freely interbreeding at least in Australia and Singapore.

Contact-mediated killing through the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) drives high levels of assortment by precipitating phase separation, even in initially well-mixed populations that do not necessarily exhibit net growth. We examine these dynamics using three different classes of mathematical models and experiments with mutually antagonistic strains of Vibrio cholerae growing on solid media, and find that all appear to de-mix via the same 'Model A' universality class of order-disorder transition. We mathematically demonstrate that contact killing should favour the evolution of public goods cooperation, and empirically examine the relationship between T6SSs and potential cooperation through phylogenetic analysis.

Along the lag phase there is a continuous increase in the energy that is dissipated irreversibly as heat, while in the exponential phase the opposite occurs.

While much is known about decisions that involve outcome-related costs (e.g., delay, risk), many of our choices are attached to actions and require an evaluation of the associated motor costs. Yet how the brain incorporates motor costs into choices remains largely unclear. We used human functional magnetic resonance imaging during choices involving monetary reward and physical effort to identify brain regions that serve as a choice comparator for effort-reward trade-offs. By independently varying both options' effort and reward levels, we were able to identify the neural signature of a comparator mechanism. A network involving supplementary motor area (SMA) and the caudal portion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded the difference in reward (positively) and effort levels (negatively) between chosen and unchosen choice options. We next modelled effort-discounted subjective values using a novel behavioural model. This revealed that the same network of regions involving dACC and SMA encoded the difference between the chosen and unchosen options' subjective values, and that activity was best described using a concave model of effort-discounting. In addition, this signal reflected how precisely value determined participants' choices. By contrast, separate signals in SMA and ventro-medial PFC (vmPFC) correlated with participants' tendency to avoid effort and seek reward, respectively. This suggests that the critical neural signature of decision-making for choices involving motor costs is found in human cingulate cortex and not vmPFC as typically reported for outcome-based choice.

A key challenge is that a large percentage of disease-associated GVs are potential regulatory variants located in noncoding regions, making them difficult to interpret. Recent research efforts focus on going beyond annotating GVs by integrating functional annotation data with GWAS to prioritize GVs. However, applicability of these approaches is challenged by high dimensionality and heterogeneity of functional annotation data. Furthermore, existing methods often assume global associations of GVs with annotation data. This strong assumption is susceptible to violations for GVs involved in many complex diseases. To address these issues, we develop a general regression framework, named Annotation Regression for GWAS (ARoG).  ARoG is based on finite mixture of linear regression models where GWAS association measures are viewed as responses and functional annotations as predictors. This mixture framework addresses heterogeneity of effects of GVs by grouping them into clusters and high dimensionality of the functional annotations by enabling annotation selection within each cluster. ARoG further employs permutation testing to evaluate the significance of selected annotations. Computational experiments indicate that ARoG can discover distinct associations between disease risk and functional annotations. Application of ARoG to autism and schizophrenia data from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium led to identification of GVs that significantly affect interactions of several transcription factors with DNA as potential mechanisms contributing to these disorders.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Statistics in Biosciences/Statistics in Biosciences1.pdf,"[( 07 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 25 Apr 2016 , 8), ( 27 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 2)]"

Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a `latent space model' that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque and we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two alternative baselines in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex.

However, the collective transport by membrane-anchored motors, i.e. motors attached to a fluid lipid bilayer, is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of motors anchorage to a lipid bilayer on the collective transport characteristics. We reconstituted membrane-anchored gliding motility assays using truncated kinesin-1 motors with a streptavidin-binding-peptide tag that can attach to streptavidin-loaded, supported lipid bilayers. We found that the diffusing kinesin-1 motors propelled the microtubules in presence of ATP. Notably, we found the gliding velocity of the microtubules to be strongly dependent on the number of motors and their diffusivity in the lipid bilayer. The microtubule gliding velocity increased with increasing motor density and membrane viscosity, reaching up to the stepping velocity of single-motors. This finding is in contrast to conventional gliding motility assays where the density of surface-immobilized kinesin-1 motors does not influence the microtubule velocity over a wide range. We reason, that the transport efficiency of membrane-anchored motors is reduced because of their slippage in the lipid bilayer, an effect which we directly observed using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.

The Pyrrhocoroidea (Largidae [220 species]; Pyrrhocoridae [~300 species]) is a superfamily of the primarily-herbivorous hemipteran infraorder Pentatomomorpha, though relationships to related superfamilies are controversial. Studies on bacterial symbionts of this group have focused on members of Pyrrhocoridae, but recent examination of species of two genera of Largidae demonstrated divergent symbiotic complexes between these putative sister families. We surveyed bacterial diversity of this group using paired-end Illumina and targeted Sanger sequencing of bacterial 16S amplicons of 30 pyrrhocoroid taxa, including 17 species of Largidae, in order to determine the identity of bacterial associates and similarity of associated microbial communities among species. We also constructed the first comprehensive phylogeny of this superfamily (4,800 bp; 5 loci; 57 ingroup + 12 outgroup taxa) in order accurately trace the evolution of symbiotic complexes among Pentatomomorpha. We undertook multiple lines of investigation (i.e., experimental rearing, FISH microscopy, phylogenetic and co-evolutionary analyses) to understand potential transmission routes of largid symbionts. We found a prevalent, specific association of Largidae with plant-beneficial-environmental clade Burkholderia housed in midgut tubules. As in other distantly-related Heteroptera, symbiotic bacteria seem to be acquired from the environment every generation. We review current understanding of symbiotic complexes within the Pentatomomorpha and discuss means to further investigations of the evolution and function of these symbioses.
Importance. Obligate symbioses with bacteria are common in insects, particularly for Hemiptera wherein varied forms of symbiosis occur, though knowledge of symbionts remains incomplete for major lineages. Thus, an accurate understanding of how these partnerships evolved and changed over millions of years is not yet achievable. We contribute to our understanding of the evolution of symbiotic complexes in Hemiptera by characterizing bacterial associates of Pyrrhocoroidea focusing on the family Largidae and by constructing a phylogeny to establish evolutionary relationships of and within this group. Members of Largidae are associated with specific symbiotic Burkholderia from a different clade than Burkholderia symbionts in other Hemiptera and are members of the earliest-diverging superfamily of Burkholderia-associated Hemiptera. Evidence suggests that species of Largidae reacquire specific symbiotic bacteria every generation environmentally, a rare strategy for insects with potentially volatile evolutionary ramifications, but one that has persisted in Largidae and other related lineages since the Cretaceous.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1800.pdf,"[( 21 Jul 2016 , 6), ( 15 Jul 2016 , 7), ( 16 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 18 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Why are they so diverse? Most herbivorous insects feed on few plant species, and adaptive host specialization is often invoked to explain their diversification. Nevertheless, it is possible that the narrow host ranges of many herbivorous insects are non-adaptive. Here, we test predictions of this hypothesis with comparative phylogenetic analyses of scale insects, a group for which there appears to be few host-use tradeoffs that would select against polyphagy, and for which passive wind-dispersal should make host specificity costly. We infer a strong positive relationship between host range and diversification rate, and a marked asymmetry in cladogenetic changes in diet breadth. These results are consonant with a system of pervasive non-adaptive host specialization in which small, drift- and extinction-prone populations are frequently isolated from persistent and polyphagous source populations. They also contrast with the negative relationship between diet breadth and taxonomic diversification that has been estimated in butterflies, a disparity which likely stems from differences in the average costs and benefits of host specificity and generalism in scale insects vs. butterflies. Our results indicate the potential for non-adaptive processes to be important to diet-breadth evolution and taxonomic diversification across herbivorous insects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolution/Evolution23.pdf,"[( 15 Jul 2016 , 5), ( 16 Jul 2016 , 2)]"

Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters' sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters' primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern.

A semi-automated software pipeline was developed and used to generate segmented, 3D plant reconstructions from the images. Automated measurements made from 3D plant reconstructions identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for standard measures of shoot architecture such as shoot height, leaf angle and leaf length, and for novel composite traits such as shoot compactness. The phenotypic variability associated with some of the QTL displayed differences in temporal prevalence; for example, alleles closely linked with the sorghum Dwarf3 gene, an auxin transporter and pleiotropic regulator of both leaf inclination angle and shoot height, influence leaf angle prior to an effect on shoot height. Furthermore, variability in composite phenotypes that measure overall shoot architecture, such as shoot compactness, is regulated by loci underlying component phenotypes like leaf angle.

Our model determines precise electric fields based on an individual head model derived from magnetic resonance imaging and calculates how these electric fields activate morphologically detailed models of different neuron types. We predict detailed neural activation patterns for different coil orientations consistent with experimental findings. Beyond this, our model allows us to predict activation thresholds for individual neurons and precise initiation sites of individual action potentials on the neurons' complex morphologies. Specifically, our model predicts that cortical layer 3 pyramidal neurons are generally easier to stimulate than layer 5 pyramidal neurons, thereby explaining the lower stimulation thresholds observed for I-waves compared to D-waves. It also predicts differences in the regions of activated cortical layer 5 and layer 3 pyramidal cells depending on coil orientation. Finally, it predicts that under standard stimulation conditions, action potentials are mostly generated at the axon initial segment of corctial pyramidal cells, with a much less important activation site being the part of a layer 5 pyramidal cell axon where it crosses the boundary between grey matter and white matter.

This region is made up of a number of subfields, which differ in both cytoarchitectural features and functional roles in the mature brain. Recent neuroimaging work in children and adolescents has suggested that these regions may undergo different developmental trajectories--a fact that has important implications for how we think about learning and memory processes in these populations. Despite the growing research interest in hippocampal structure and function at the subfield level in healthy young adults, comparatively fewer studies have been carried out looking at subfield development. One barrier to studying these questions has been that manual segmentation of hippocampal subfields--considered by many to be the ""gold standard"" approach for defining these regions--is laborious and can be infeasible for large cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of cognitive development. Moreover, manual segmentation requires some subjectivity and is not impervious to bias or error. In a developmental sample of individuals spanning 6-30 years, we compared the performance of two semi-automated segmentation approaches, Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS), to manual subfield delineation on each individual by a single expert rater. Across several quantitative metrics, we found negligible differences in subfield reliability across the child, adolescent, and adult age groups, suggesting that these methods can be reliability applied to developmental studies. We conclude that ASHS outperforms ANTs overall, and is thus preferable for analyses carried out in individual subject space. However, we underscore that ANTs is also acceptable, and may be well-suited for analyses requiring normalization to a single group template (e.g., voxelwise analyses across a wide age range). Previous work has validated the use of such methods in healthy young adults, as well as several special populations such as older adults and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment.

Here we use chromatin state analyses in early embryos and L3 larvae to investigate genome domain organization and its regulation in C. elegans.  At both stages we find that the genome is organized into extended chromatin domains of high or low gene activity defined by different subsets of states, and enriched for H3K36me3 or H3K27me3 respectively. The border regions between domains contain large intergenic regions and a high density of transcription factor binding, suggesting a role for transcription regulation in separating chromatin domains. Despite the differences in cell types, overall domain organization is remarkably similar in early embryos and L3 larvae, with conservation of 85% of domain border positions.  Most genes in high activity domains are expressed in the germ line and broadly across cell types, whereas low activity domains are enriched for genes that are developmentally regulated.

Our approach estimated the extent to which multiple distinct atrophy patterns were expressed within each participant rather than assuming that each participant expressed a single atrophy factor. The model revealed a temporal atrophy factor (medial temporal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala), a subcortical atrophy factor (striatum, thalamus and cerebellum), and a cortical atrophy factor (frontal, parietal, lateral temporal and lateral occipital cortices). To explore the influence of each factor in early AD, atrophy factor compositions were inferred in beta-amyloid-positive (Aβ+) mild cognitively impaired
(MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) participants. All three factors were associated with memory decline across the entire clinical spectrum, whereas the cortical factor was associated with executive function decline in Aβ+ MCI participants and AD dementia patients. Direct comparison between factors revealed that the temporal factor showed the strongest association with memory, while the cortical factor showed the strongest association with executive function. The subcortical factor was associated with the slowest decline for both memory and executive function compared to temporal and cortical factors. These results suggest that distinct patterns of atrophy influence decline across different cognitive domains.

Second, we tested our STR capture strategy on a P. diadema fecal DNA preparation, and report robust initial results and methodological suggestions for future implementations. In addition to STR targets, this approach also generates large, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels from regions flanking the STR loci.

Results: We present a hidden Markov model based approach we call delta-bitscore (DBS) for identifying orthologous proteins that have diverged at the amino acid sequence level in a way that is likely to impact biological function. We benchmark this approach with several widely used datasets and apply it to a proof-of-concept study of orthologous proteomes in an investigation of host adaptation in Salmonella enterica. We highlight the value of the method in identifying functional divergence of genes, and suggest that this tool may be a better approach than the commonly used dN/dS metric for identifying functionally significant genetic changes occurring in recently diverged organisms.

Here we describe a novel mathematical property of codominant marker data when it is recoded as binary (presence/absence) allelic variables: under random mating in an infinite population, two allelic variables will be negatively correlated if they belong to the same locus, but uncorrelated if they belong to different loci.

At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers required the MutLγ resolvase, which forms most Spo11-initiated crossovers.

ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli is an antiporter, coupling the transport of Cl- and H+ ions in opposite directions and driven by the concentration gradients of the ions. Despite keen interest in this protein, the molecular mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling has not been fully elucidated. Here, we have used multiscale simulation to help identify the essential mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling. We find that the highest barrier for proton transport (PT) from the intra- to extracellular solution is attributable to a chemical reaction—the deprotonation of glutamic acid 148 (E148). This barrier is significantly reduced by the binding of Cl- in the ""central"" site (Cl-cen), which displaces E148 and thereby facilitates its deprotonation. Conversely, in the absence of Cl-cen E148 favors the ""down"" conformation, which results in a much higher cumulative rotation and deprotonation barrier that effectively blocks PT to the extracellular solution. Thus, the rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl-/H+ coupling. As a control, we have also simulated PT in the ClC-ec1 E148A mutant to further understand the role of this residue. Replacement with a nonprotonatable residue greatly increases the free energy barrier for PT from E203 to the extracellular solution, explaining the experimental result that PT in E148A is blocked whether or not Cl-cen is present. The results presented here suggest both how a chemical reaction can control the rate of PT and also how it can provide a mechanism for a coupling of the two ion transport processes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of the American Chemical Society/Journal of the American Chemical Society1.pdf,"[( 18 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 19 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

In amplification, individuals respond to various feedback about their relative fitness (hereafter, ""fitness"" is used to mean general ability against biotic and abiotic stressors) by adjusting their ability to reproduce in the direction of their relative fitness, such that fitter individuals garner an even greater reproductive share than otherwise.  In reservation, fitter individuals, in particular, refrain from functioning maximally against the natural enemies most likely to rapidly evolve a set of mutations that eliminates the practicing allele.  This reservation primarily 1) allows the identification of holders of the practicing allele that are fittest against these ""lethal enemies,"" which helps restrict reproduction to these holders and 2) attenuates selection upon holders of mutant alleles and, especially, these lethal enemies by allowing the less fit individuals in these mutant and enemy populations to garner a greater reproductive share than otherwise.  That is, the dual strategies of amplification and reservation increase the selection intensity upon the practicing individuals and decrease the selection intensity upon their mutant conspecifics and lethal enemies, which promotes the frequency and persistence of these strategies.  At least ten empirical phenomena are characterized by, heretofore, paradoxical decrementations in inclusive fitness and are explained by this theory of bilateral decrementation.  Bilateral decrementation offers a nascent example of volitional selection practiced in nature and the prevalence with which it is practiced confers empirical support for robust selection at higher levels than kin (e.g., spatial, group).",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1805.pdf,"[( 18 Jul 2016 , 5), ( 19 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Insect herbivores are no exception, and the majority have evolved to colonise a small number of closely related host species. Remarkably, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, colonises plant species across 40 families and single M. persicae clonal lineages can colonise distantly related plants. This remarkable ability makes M. persicae a highly destructive pest of many important crop species.
Results To investigate the exceptional phenotypic plasticity of M. persicae, we sequenced the M. persicae genome and assessed how one clonal lineage responds to host plant species of different families. We show that genetically identical individuals are able to colonise distantly related host species through the differential regulation of genes belonging to aphid-expanded gene families. Multigene clusters collectively up-regulate in single aphids within two days upon host switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional significance of this rapid transcriptional change using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down of genes belonging to the cathepsin B gene family. Knock-down of cathepsin B genes reduced aphid fitness, but only on the host that induced up-regulation of these genes.
Conclusions Previous research has focused on the role of genetic adaptation of parasites to their hosts. Here we show that the generalist aphid pest M. persicae is able to colonise diverse host plant species in the absence of genetic specialisation.

We tested this by measuring differential expression of neuropeptides in female Nicrophorus vespilloides Parenting in this species is extensive and complex as caring adults regurgitate food to begging, dependent offspring. We identified neuropeptides associated with mating, feeding, aggression, and social interactions by sampling females in different behavioural states: solitary, actively parenting, or post-parenting and solitary. We measured peptide abundance in adult female brains and identified 130 peptides belonging to 17 neuropeptides. Of these 17, seven were differentially expressed. Six of the seven were up-regulated during parenting. None of the identified neuropeptides have previously been associated with parental care, but all have known roles in the behavioural precursors. Two, tachykinin and sulfakinin, influence multiple pathways. Our study supports the prediction that appropriate behavioural precursors are likely targets of selection during the evolution of parenting.

We show that there is a sexual dimorphism regarding the expression of Pgrmc2 in adrenals and gonads of WT and Aaas KO mice. Female Aaas KO mice are sterile due to delayed oocyte maturation and meiotic spindle assembly. A participation in meiotic spindle assembly confirms the recently investigated involvement of ALADIN in mitosis and emphasises an interaction with PGRMC2 which is a regulator of cell cycle.

There has been heated debate about the potential of genetic processes to drive small populations to extinction, but recent studies have shown that such processes clearly impact small populations over short time scales, and some may generate Allee effects. However, as opposed to the ecological Allee effect, which is underpinned by cooperative interactions between individuals, genetically driven Allee effects require a change in genetic structure to link the decline in population size with a decrease in fitness components. We therefore define the genetic Allee effect as a two-step process whereby a decrease in population size leads to a change in population genetic structure, and in turn, to a decrease in individual fitness. We describe potential underlying mechanisms, and review the evidence for this original type of component Allee effect, using published examples from both plants and animals.

the number of allelic states greatly exceeds the population size. In this limit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by mutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored through mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the probabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a population,
do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities of allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used in population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we
develop an extension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes. Although our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which alleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of landscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more tractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from sequence
data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and selection coefficients,
the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral. Therefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key evolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving populations to collect data on
locus polymorphisms. We also carry out numerical investigation of various approximations involved in deriving our sampling formulas, such as the infinite allele limit and the ""full connectivity"" assumption in which each allele can mutate into any other allele. We find that our theory remains sufficiently accurate even if these assumptions are relaxed. Thus, our framework establishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from samples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness

However, it is unclear how MIA disrupts fetal brain gene expression in ways that may explain this increased risk. Here we examine how MIA dysregulates fetal brain gene expression near the end of the first trimester of human gestation in ways relevant to ASD-associated pathophysiology. MIA downregulates expression of ASD- associated genes, with the largest enrichments in genes known to harbor rare highly penetrant mutations. MIA also downregulates expression of many genes also known to be persistently downregulated in ASD cortex later in life and which are canonically known for roles in affecting prenatally-late developmental processes at the synapse. Transcriptional and translational programs that are downstream targets of highly ASD-penetrant FMR1 and CHD8 genes are also heavily affected by MIA. MIA strongly upregulates expression of a large number of genes involved in translation initiation, cell cycle, DNA damage, and proteolysis processes that affect multiple key neural developmental functions. Upregulation of translation initiation is common to and preserved in gene network structure with the ASD cortical transcriptome throughout life and has downstream impact on cell cycle processes. The cap-dependent translation initiation gene, EIF4E, is one of the most MIA-dysregulated of all ASD-associated genes and targeted network analyses demonstrate prominent MIA-induced transcriptional dysregulation of mTOR and EIF4E-dependent signaling. This dysregulation of translation initiation via alteration of the Tsc2-mTor-Eif4e-axis was further validated across MIA rodent models.

No molecular function has yet been linked to this accessory protein. We now report that S2 can replace the activity of Nef on HIV-1 infectivity, being required to antagonize the inhibitory activity of SERINC proteins on Nef-defective HIV-1. Similar to Nef, S2 excludes SERINC5 from virus particles and requires an ExxxLL motif predicted to recruit the clathrin adaptor AP2. Accordingly, a functional endocytic machinery is essential for S2-mediated infectivity enhancement, which is impaired by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition to retargeting SERINC5 to a late endosomal compartment, S2 promotes the host factor degradation. Emphasizing the similarity with Nef, we show that S2 is myristoylated and, compatible with a crucial role of the post-translational modification, its N-terminal glycine is required for the anti-SERINC5 activity. 
EIAV-derived vectors devoid of S2 are less susceptible than HIV-1 to the inhibitory effect of both human and equine SERINC5. We then identified the envelope glycoprotein of EIAV as a determinant which also modulates retrovirus susceptibility to SERINC5, indicating a bi-modular ability of the equine lentivirus to counteract the host factor.
S2 shares no sequence homology with other retroviral factors known to counteract SERINC5. Adding to primate lentivirus Nef and gammaretrovirus glycoGag, the accessory protein from EIAV makes another example of a retroviral virulence determinant which independently evolved SERINC5-antagonizing activity.

To explain these observations and formulate ecological hypotheses, we need to acquire better understanding to parasites population genetics and dynamics, and their main determinants. Here, we analyse the impact of co-evolutionary processes on genetic diversity and structure of parasite populations, using a model composed of the louse Polyplax serrata and its hosts, mice of the genus Apodemus, collected from several dozens of localities across Europe.

For this end, we reconstruct the chromatin dynamics from the EP matrix using polymer model and explore the transient properties, constrained by the statistics of the data. To construct the polymer, we use the EP decay in two steps: first, to account for TADs, we introduce random connectors inside a restricted region defining the TADs. Second, we account for long-range frequent specific genomic interactions in the polymer architecture. Finally, stochastic simulations show that only a small number of randomly placed connectors are required to reproduce the EP of TADs, and allow us to compute the mean first time and the conditional encounter probability of three key genomic sites to meet.

Isolates from a given outbreak are sequenced, and the patterns of shared variation are used to infer which isolates within the outbreak are most closely related to each other. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees typically used to represent this variation are not directly informative about who infected whom -- a phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree. However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a phylogeny while accounting for within-host genetic diversity by colouring the branches of a phylogeny according to which host those branches were in. Here we extend this approach and show that it can be applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks. This requires computing the correct probability of an observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate how to do this for a large class of epidemiological models. We also demonstrate how the branch colouring approach can incorporate a variable number of unique colours to represent unsampled intermediates in transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is a reversible jump Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, which we apply to both simulated data and real data from an outbreak of tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled cases and an outbreak which may not have reached its end, our method is uniquely suited to use in a public health environment during real-time outbreak investigations.

In the mammalian gut, fluctuations in nutrient levels and other physiological parameters are structured by the animal host's behavior, diet, health and microbiota composition. Microbial cells that are able to anticipate these fluctuations by exploiting this structure would likely gain a fitness advantage, by adapting their internal state in advance. We propose that the problem of adaptive growth in these structured changing environments can be viewed as probabilistic inference. We analyze environments that are ""meta-changing"": where there are changes in the way the environment fluctuates, governed by a mechanism unobservable to cells. We develop a dynamic Bayesian model of these environments and show that a real-time inference algorithm (particle filtering) for this model can be used as a microbial growth strategy implementable in molecular circuits.

However, most analytical results so far have only been obtained for two-player or linear games, while the study of more complex multiplayer games has been usually tackled by computer simulations. Here we investigate evolutionary multiplayer games on graphs updated with a Moran death-Birth process. For cycles, we obtain an exact analytical condition for cooperation to be favored by natural selection, given in terms of the payoffs of the game and a set of structure coefficients. For regular graphs of degree three and larger, we estimate this condition using a combination of pair approximation and diffusion approximation. For a large class of cooperation games, our approximations suggest that graph-structured populations are stronger promoters of cooperation than populations lacking spatial structure. Computer simulations validate our analytical approximations for random regular graphs and cycles, but show systematic differences for graphs with many loops such as lattices. In particular, our simulation results show that these kinds of graphs can even lead to more stringent conditions for the evolution of cooperation than well-mixed populations.

Many relevant gene-drug associations have been discovered, but PGx guided treatment needs to be cost-effective as well as clinically beneficial to be incorporated into standard healthcare. Progress in this area can be assessed by reviewing economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of PGx testing versus standard treatment. We performed a review of economic evaluations for PGx associations listed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/Pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm). We determined the proportion of evaluations that found PGx guided treatment to be cost-effective or dominant over the alternative strategies, and we estimated the impact on this proportion of removing the cost of genetic testing. Of the 130 PGx associations in the FDA table, 44 economic evaluations, relating to 10 drugs, were identified. Of these evaluations, 57% drew conclusions in favour of PGx testing, of which 30% were cost-effective and 27% were dominant (cost-saving). If genetic information was freely available, 75% of economic evaluations would support PGx guided treatment, of which 25% would be cost-effective and 50% would be dominant. Thus, PGx guided treatment can be a cost-effective and even cost-saving strategy. Having genetic information readily available in the clinical health record is a realistic future prospect, and would make more genetic tests economically worthwhile.

The D (R) enantiomer (D-2-HG) is an oncometabolite generated from α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), while L (S) 2-HG is generated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in response to hypoxia. Since acidic pH is a common feature of hypoxia, as well as tumor and stem cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that pH may regulate cellular 2-HG levels. Herein we report that cytosolic acidification under normoxia moderately elevated 2-HG in cells, and boosting endogenous substrate α-KG levels further stimulated this elevation. Studies with isolated LDH-1 and MDH-2 revealed that generation of 2-HG by both enzymes was stimulated several-fold at acidic pH, relative to normal physiologic pH. In addition, acidic pH was found to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial L-2-HG removal enzyme L-2-HG dehydrogenase, and to stimulate the reverse reaction of ICDH (carboxylation of α-KG to isocitrate). Furthermore, since acidic pH is known to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and 2-HG is a known inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, we hypothesized that 2-HG may be required for acid-induced HIF stabilization. Accordingly, cells stably over-expressing L-2HGDH exhibited a blunted HIF response to acid.

We compared the morphological structure of ant assemblages in two biogeographic regions along two extensive latitudinal gradients to examine common patterns and unique characteristics of trait distribution. We sampled ant assemblages along extensive latitudinal gradients in Tropical Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil and temperate forests in the eastern United States. We quantified 14 morphological traits related to the ecology and life history of each of 599 ant species and defined the morphological space occupied by different ant assemblages. Null models were used to test whether tropical and temperate ant assemblages differed from random expectation in morphological structure. Correlations between traits and climate were used to infer associations between habitat characteristics and morphological space occupied by ant assemblages. Tropical ant assemblages had higher morphological diversity and variation in the space of occupied morphospace, whereas temperate assemblages had higher variance in size. Although tropical ant assemblages had smaller morphological distances among species, species packing (i.e., mean nearest-neighbor distance) did not differ between regions. Null model analysis revealed scant evidence of habitat filtering or niche differentiation within assemblages. Different traits had different means, variances, skewness, and kurtosis values along each environmental gradient. Mean trait values within assemblages were associated mainly with region and correlated with temperature but trait variances had more complex responses to climate, including interactions between temperature and precipitation in the models. The higher functional diversity in tropical ant assemblages occurs by expansion of the morphospace rather than through an increase in species packing.

Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral---and segregating at high frequency---in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human--Neanderthal hybrids.

When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package.

We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40% of false discoveries.

Chan School of Public Health), (Leung, Gabriel M.,  University of Hong Kong), (Lipsitch, Marc,  Harvard Chan School of Public Health)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/053421 ,"Background
The ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola strains the global vaccine supply, prompting WHO to adopt dose sparing for its vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in July-August 2016. Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.

Methods
We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. 

Findings
We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5.2 and 7.1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.	 

Interpretation
Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1825.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 23 May 2016 , 1), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 12), ( 15 May 2016 , 2), ( 19 May 2016 , 18), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 10 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 16 May 2016 , 1), ( 21 May 2016 , 4), ( 16 Feb 2017 , 2), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 16 Dec 2016 , 2), ( 24 May 2016 , 1), ( 18 May 2016 , 2), ( 29 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 17 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 14 May 2016 , 14), ( 01 Sep 2016 , 4)]"

It has been thought that such mutations in myosin increase the intrinsic force of the motor, its velocity of contraction, or its ATPase activity, giving rise to hyper-contractility.  We hypothesize that while these parameters are mildly affected by most myosin HCM-causing mutations, a major effect of a majority of myosin HCM mutations is likely to involve an increase in the number of myosin heads that are functionally accessible (Na) for interaction with actin in the sarcomere.  We consider a model involving three types of interactions involving the myosin mesa and the converter domain of the myosin motor that hold myosin heads in a sequestered state, likely to be released in a graded manner as the demands on the heart increase: 1) the two myosin heads binding to one another, 2) one head binding to its own coiled-coil tail, and 3) the other head binding to myosin binding protein-C. In addition there is clear evidence of interaction between the coiled-coil tail of myosin and myosin binding protein-C. Experimentally, here we focus on myosin head binding to its own coiled-coil tail and to myosin binding protein-C.  We show that phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain and myosin binding protein-C weaken these respective associations, consistent with known enhancements of sarcomere function by these phosphorylations.  We show that these interactions are weakened as a result of myosin HCM mutations, in a manner consistent with our structural model.  Our data suggests a potential unifying hypothesis for the molecular basis of hyper-contractility caused by human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myosin mutations, whereby the mutations give rise to an increase in the number of myosin heads that are functionally accessible for interaction with actin in the sarcomere, causing the hyper-contractility observed clinically.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1827.pdf,"[( 25 Jul 2016 , 3)]"

Here we describe the comprehensive pharmacological profiles of W-18 and W-15.  Although W-18 and W-15 have been described as having potent anti-nociceptive activity and are presumed to interact with opioid receptors, we found them to be without detectible opioid activity at μ, δ, κ and nociception opioid receptors in a variety of assays.  We also tested W-18 and W-15 for activity as allosteric modulators at opioid receptors and found them devoid of significant positive or negative allosteric modulatory activity.  Comprehensive profiling at essentially all the druggable G-protein coupled receptors in the human genome using the PRESTO-Tango platform revealed no significant activity.  In silico predictions using the Similarity Ensemble Approach suggested activity for W-18 only weakly at H3-histamine receptors, which was not confirmed in radioligand binding studies. Weak activity at the sigma receptors and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor were found for W-18 (Ki=271 nM); W-15 displayed weak antagonist activity at 5-HT2-family serotonin receptors. W-18 is extensively metabolized, but its metabolites also lack opioid activity. W-18 and W-15 did inhibit hERG binding suggesting possible cardiovascular side-effects with high doses.

We use a model informed by field data to assess the conditions likely to facilitate local transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses from an infected traveler to Ae. albopictus and then to other humans in USA cities with variable human densities and seasonality.

Mosquito-borne disease occurs when specific combinations of conditions maximize virus-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human contact rates. We develop a mathematical model that captures the epidemiology and is informed by current data on vector ecology from urban sites. The model predicts that one of every two infectious travelers arriving at peak mosquito season could initiate local transmission and > 10% of the introductions could generate a disease outbreak of at least 100 people. Despite Ae. albopictus propensity for biting non-human vertebrates, we also demonstrate that local virus transmission and human outbreaks may occur when vectors feed from humans even just 40% of the time.

With the advent of genome editing technologies, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) system, we are now able to introduce improved crop traits in a rapid and efficient manner.

We hypothesize that these mutations affect the biomechanical properties of myosin, such as increasing its intrinsic force and/or its duty ratio and therefore the ensemble force of the sarcomere. Using recombinant human β-cardiac myosin, we characterize the molecular effects of three severe HCM-causing converter domain mutations R719W, R723G and G741R. Contrary to our hypothesis, the intrinsic forces of R719W and R723G mutant myosins are decreased compared to wild type, and unchanged for G741R. Actin and regulated thin filament gliding velocities are ~15 percent faster for R719W and R723G myosin, while there is no change in velocity for G741R. ATPase activities and the load-dependent velocity change profiles of all three mutant proteins are very similar to wild type. These results indicate that the net biomechanical properties of human β-cardiac myosin carrying these converter domain mutations are very similar to wild type or even slightly hypo-contractile, leading us to consider an alternative mechanism for the clinically observed hyper-contractility.

In the present work we tackled this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intra-laminar, inter-laminar, inter-areal and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, and shedding insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas: feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low beta (8-15 Hz) oscillations. We found that in order for the model to account for the experimental observations, the feedback projection needs to predominantly target infragranular layers in a target area, which leads to a proposed circuit substrate for predictive coding.

Here with the same methods previously established, we aimed to further decipher the mechanism by characterizing two prion-like sequences with the electrostatic properties very different from that of the full-length TDP-43 prion-like domain with a very basic pI value: namely the C-half of the TDP-43 prion-like domain only abundant in Gly, Ser, Asn and Gln with a pI of ~6.3, and the FUS prion-like domain enriched with Gly, Ser, Gln and Tyr with a pI of ~3.5. Interestingly, the C-half with the TDP-43 unique hydrophobic region removed is no longer able to form insoluble aggregates/fibrils but still capable of self-assembling into the reversible hydrogel with cross-β structures, despite being much slower than the full-length. On the other hand, the FUS prion-like domain rapidly self-assembles into the reversible hydrogel with cross-β fibrillar structures in 1 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 but its self-assembly becomes very slow in 50 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5. Our study reveals that despite having completely different electrostatic properties, the full-length and C-half of the TDP-43 prion-like domain, as well as FUS prion-like domain all have the similar pH-dependence in self-assembly as we previously reported (Lim et al., [2016] PLOS Biol 14:e1002338). This unambiguously indicates that the self-assembly of the prion-like domains is not generally governed by the electrostatic interaction. Rather, their self-assembly and fibrillization are specified by the sequences despite being highly polar and degenerative. Furthermore, our study provides the first evidence that the formation of reversible hydrogel with cross-β structures is separable from fibrillization of the prion-like domain.

Here, we show that a combination of inhibited translation initiation and accelerated protein degradation - both dependent on the intron - prevents the accumulation of Hac1 protein when the UPR is inactive.

The integrity of foot process interactions depends on tight spatial control of the dynamics of the underlying actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by the GTPases, Rac1 and RhoA. To understand how spatially-specific regulation of actin filament dynamics within foot processes controls local morphology, we used a combination of 3-D microscopy and dynamical models. We experimentally determined cell-cell interactions using serial blockface scanning electron microscopy and reconstructed a 3-D spatial representation of a podocyte. We developed a minimal dynamical system for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; using this 3-D model, we determined how spatial reaction-diffusion dynamics can dysregulate actin bundling, leading to propagation of chaotic foot process effacement. Consistent with experimental observations, our simulations predicted that hyperactive RhoA could destabilize the cytoskeleton. Our simulations showed that deleterious mechanochemical stimuli could lead to local heterogeneity of cytoskeletal dynamics resulting in the emergence of progressive and chaotic loss of foot processes. While global enhancement of Rac1 may result in stronger bundles, the spatial simulations showed that even transient local heterogeneities in polymerization could have dramatic consequences in the stability of multiple foot processes.

progress has been made to adapt AFNI to fix such problems.  Two
separate lines of changes have been made.  First, a long-tailed
model for the spatial correlation of the FMRI noise characterized
by autocorrelation function (ACF) was developed and implemented
into the 3dClustSim tool for determining the cluster-size
threshold to use for a given voxel-wise threshold.  Second, the

voxel-wise t-tests and then to feed those randomized t-statistic
maps into 3dClustSim directly for cluster-size threshold
determination﹣without any spatial model for the ACF.  These
approaches were tested with the Beijing subset of the FCON-1000

improved (reduced) FPR, but in many cases is still above the

t-tests from a univariate GLM are adequate for the group analysis
in question, the second approach is what the AFNI group currently
recommends for thresholding.  If more complex per-voxel
statistical analyses are required (where
permutation/randomization is impracticable), then our current
recommendation is to use the new ACF modeling approach coupled
with a per-voxel p-threshold of 0.001 or below. Simulations were

Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney occupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction, management of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy and prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from serial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating efficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of CI.

Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more reliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat impractical in the pediatric population.

I show that optimal decoding of such activity predicts characteristic deviations from the normal distribution of errors at low gains. Examining human perception of orientation stimuli, I show that these predicted deviations are present at near-threshold levels of contrast. The findings may provide a neural-level explanation for the appearance of a threshold in perceptual awareness, whereby stimuli are categorized as seen or unseen.

I conducted a meta-analysis of effect sizes (LnRR) assessing the impacts of acidification on the feeding ability of three groups of marine calcifiers - molluscs, arthropods, and echinoderms. Results suggested taxon-dependent effects of acidification on calcifier feeding performance, with depressed feeding observed for molluscs, echinoderms, and when all taxa were considered. However, ocean acidification had no effect on feeding performance in marine arthropods and larval feeding performance appeared more vulnerable than that of juveniles and adults. Feeding performance was not related to acclimation time nor pCO2 level. This study suggests that the feeding performance of molluscs and early life-stage echinoderms may be depressed in a more acidic ocean, but that arthropod feeding performance is unlikely to suffer. Such changes in feeding performance could contribute to slower growth and development in the early life stages of these organisms and could potentially contribute to changes in community and ecosystem structure where these organisms coexist.  Finally, feeding performance could, at least in part, moderate the degree to which molluscs and echinoderms can use food to overcome acidification effects early in life.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1836.pdf,"[( 27 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 6), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

New Method: To further clarify the heteromerization through the scA2AR/D2LR, we here designed supramolecularly ˋexclusiveˊ monomers and dimers, using the Cϵ2 domain of IgE-Fc or apoproteins of the bacterial light-harvesting antenna complex.
Results: A concept of the recptor protein assembly regulation, i.e., the selective monomer/non-obligate dimer formation was obtained.

The high error rates make it difficult to use this data alone, particularly with highly repetitive plant genomes. Errors in the raw data can lead to insertion or deletion errors (indels) in the consensus genome sequence, which in turn create significant problems for downstream analysis; for example, a single indel may shift the reading frame and incorrectly truncate a protein sequence. Here we describe an algorithm that solves the high error rate problem by combining long, high-error reads with shorter but much more accurate Illumina sequencing reads, whose error rates average <1%. Our hybrid assembly algorithm combines these two types of reads to construct mega-reads, which are both long and accurate, and then assembles the mega-reads using the CABOG assembler, which was designed for long reads. We apply this technique to a large data set of Illumina and PacBio sequences from the species Aegilops tauschii, a large and highly repetitive plant genome that has resisted previous attempts at assembly.

Taking advantage of an ongoing microcosm experiment, we studied how methanotrophic microbial communities adapted to disturbances in energy input over a 20 day cycle period. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes together with quantification of microbial abundance and ecosystem function was used to explore the long-term dynamics (510 days) of methanotrophic communities under continuous versus cyclic chemical energy supply. We observed that microbial communities appear inherently well-adapted to disturbances in energy input and that changes in community structure in both treatments are more dependent on internal dynamics than on external forcing. Results also show that the rare biosphere is critical to seeding the internal community dynamics, perhaps due to cross-feeding or other strategies. We conclude that in our experimental system, endogenous feedbacks were more important than exogenous drivers in shaping the community dynamics over time, suggesting that ecosystems can maintain their function despite inherently unstable community dynamics. 
IMPORTANCE 
Within the broader ecological context, biological communities are often viewed as stable and only experience succession or replacement when subject to external perturbations, such as changes in food availability or introduction of exotic species. Our findings indicate that microbial communities can exhibit strong internal dynamics that may be more important in shaping community succession than external drivers.  Dynamic ""unstable"" communities may be important for ecosystem functional stability, with rare organisms playing an important role in community restructuring.  Understanding the mechanisms responsible for internal community dynamics will certainly be required for understanding and manipulating microbiomes in both host-associated and natural ecosystems.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/mSystems/mSystems7.pdf,"[( 27 Jul 2016 , 9), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 5)]"

Several hypotheses suggest benefits that outweigh the obvious costs associated with encapsidating each genomic segment into a different viral particle: reduced transmission efficiency and segregation of coadapted genes.  These putative advantages range from increasing genome size despite high mutation rates (i.e., escaping from Eigen paradox), faster replication, more efficient selection resulting from segment reassortment during mixed infections, or enhanced virion stability and cell-to-cell movement.  However, empirical support for these hypotheses is scarce.  A more recent hypothesis is that segmentation represents a simple and robust mechanism to regulate gene copy number and, thereby, gene expression.  According to this hypothesis, the ratio at which different segments exist during infection of individual hosts should represent a stable situation and would respond to the varying necessities of viral components during infection.  Here we report the results of experiments designed to test whether an evolutionary stable equilibrium exists for the three RNAs that constitute the genome of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV).  Starting infections with many different combinations of the three segments, we found that, as infection progresses, the abundance of each genome segment always evolves towards a constant ratio.  Population genetic analyses show that the segments ratio at this equilibrium is determined by frequency-dependent selection; indeed, it represents an evolutionary stable solution.  The replication of RNAs 1 and 2 was coupled and collaborative, whereas the replication of RNA 3 interfered with the replication of the other two.  We found that the equilibrium solution is slightly different for the total amounts of RNA produced and encapsidated, suggesting that competition exists between all RNAs during encapsidation.

A powerful tool to investigate phosphorylation is mass-spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics, which enables the identification of thousands of phosphorylated peptides in a single experiment. Since every phosphorylation event results from the activity of a protein kinase, high-coverage phosphoproteomics data should indirectly contain comprehensive information about the activity of protein kinases.

We identified and localized over 3000 proteins from strains of C. elegans expressing APX in either the nucleus or cytoplasm of the intestine, epidermis, body wall muscle, or pharyngeal muscle. We also identified several hundred proteins that were specifically localized to one of the four tissues analyzed or specifically localized to the cytoplasm or the nucleus. This approach resulted in the identification of both previously characterized and unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Further, we confirmed the tissue- and subcellular-specific localization of a subset of identified proteins using GFP-tagging and fluorescence microscopy, validating our in vivo proximity-based proteomics technique. Together, these results demonstrate a new approach that enables the tissue- and subcellular-specific identification and quantification of proteins within a live animal.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Science Advances/Science Advances9.pdf,"[( 30 Jul 2016 , 6), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 11 May 2017 , 1), ( 12 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 27 Jul 2016 , 5)]"

However, heterozygosity and mutation rate appear to be linked such that the loss of diversity associated with humans migrating out of Africa caused a mutational slowdown, allowing Africans to diverge more from both our common ancestor and from Neanderthals.  Here I use a range of contrasting tests aimed at distinguishing between mutation slowdown and introgression as explanations for the unexpectedly high rate of base-sharing between non-Africans and Neanderthals.  In every instance the mutation slowdown hypothesis fits better.  Thus, while some interbreeding likely occurred, as evidenced by the finding of skeletons of admixed individuals, adaptive genes and the apparently large contribution of Denisovan DNA to Oceanian genomes, my results challenge the idea that non-Africans generally carry an appreciable Neanderthal legacy.  My analysis shows that inferences about introgression may be unreliable unless variation in mutation rate linked to demographically induced changes in heterozygosity can be excluded as an alternative hypothesis.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1845.pdf,"[( 28 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 24 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 08 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jul 2016 , 7), ( 01 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 05 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 23 Jul 2016 , 6), ( 22 Jul 2016 , 10), ( 04 Jul 2017 , 1)]"

Surprisingly, overexpression of orthologous DHFRs from other bacterial species caused minimal metabolic and fitness perturbations, despite pulling out more interacting partners than overexpressed endogenous DHFR. Orthologous DHFRs were less potent in inhibiting E. coli GlyA and PurH, or gaining a catalytic improvement upon interaction with PurH, indicating a partial loss of interaction specificity due to evolutionary divergence.

Amino acid changes in specific positions of proteins encoded by Plasmodium falciparum genes pfcrt, dhps, dhfr, and pfmdr1 are used as molecular markers of resistance to antimalarials such as chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, as well as artemisinin derivatives. However, a challenge to the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codons responsible for these amino acid changes, in several samples, is the scarcity of automated computational pipelines for molecular biologists to; rapidly analyze ABI (Applied Biosystems) Sanger sequencing data spanning the codons of interest in order to characterize these codons and detect these molecular markers of drug resistance.  The pipeline described here is an attempt to address this need. 
Method: This pipeline is a combination of existing tools, notably SAMtools and Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA), as well as custom Python and BASH scripts. It is designed to run on the UNIX shell, a command line interpreter. To characterize the codons associated with anti-malarial drug resistance (ADR) in a particular gene using this pipeline, the following options are required; a path to reference coding sequence of the gene in FASTA format, gene symbol (pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhps or dhfr), and a path to the directory of ABI sequencing trace files for the samples. With these inputs, the pipeline performs base calling and trimming, sequence alignment, and alignment parsing. 
Results: The output of the pipeline is a CSV (Comma-separated values) file of sample names, codons and their corresponding encoded amino acids.  The data generated can be readily analyzed using widely available statistical or spreadsheet software, to determine the frequency of molecular markers of resistance to anti-malarials such as chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin derivatives.

Phenotypic plasticity helps populations to evade extinctions in novel environments, facilitates adaptation and fuels evolution. However, most studies focus on understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic regulation in specific environments. As a result, while it's evolutionary relevance is well established, genetic mechanisms regulating phenotypic plasticity and their overlap with the environment specific regulators is not well understood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly sensitive to the environment, which acts as not just external stimulus but also as signalling cue for this unicellular, sessile organism. We used a previously published dataset of a biparental yeast population grown in 34 diverse environments and mapped genetic loci regulating variation in phenotypic plasticity, plasticity QTL, and compared them with environment-specific QTL. Plasticity QTL is one whose one allele exhibits high plasticity whereas the other shows a relatively canalised behaviour. We mapped phenotypic plasticity using two parameters - environmental variance, an environmental order-independent parameter and reaction norm (slope), an environmental order-dependent parameter. Our results show a partial overlap between pleiotropic QTL and plasticity QTL such that while some plasticity QTL are also pleiotropic, others have a significant effect on phenotypic plasticity without being significant in any environment independently. Furthermore, while some plasticity QTL are revealed only in specific environmental orders, we identify large effect plasticity QTL, which are order-independent such that whatever the order of the environments, one allele is always plastic and the other is canalised. Finally, we show that the environments can be divided into two categories based on the phenotypic diversity of the population within them and the two categories have differential regulators of phenotypic plasticity.

Black coat colour is the most predominant within the breed, with dominant black MC1R alleles of both Asian and European origin contributing. European alleles for spotting are present at a low frequency in the sample set, and may account for the occurrence of spotted piglets in some APD litters.

To further test for visual dominance in PPC, we evaluated electrophysiological responses following individual sensory events and observed much larger responses following visual stimuli than auditory stimuli.

However, few studies have examined the relative contributions of racial/ethnic identity, genetic ancestry, and environmental exposures on well-established and fundamental biological processes. We examined the associations between ethnicity, ancestry, and environmental exposures and DNA methylation. We typed over 450,000 CpG sites in primary whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic descent who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were significantly associated with methylation levels at a large number of CpG sites (916 and 194, respectively). Among loci differentially methylated between ethnic groups, a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity could be accounted for by shared genomic ancestry accounts. We also found significant enrichment (p = 4.2 × 10-64) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated with environmental and social exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy.

Although cis-regulatory variation has long been considered important for adaptation, we still have a limited understanding of the selective importance and genomic determinants of standing cis-regulatory variation. To address these questions, we studied the prevalence, genomic determinants and selective forces shaping cis-regulatory variation in the outcrossing plant Capsella grandiflora. We first identified a set of 1,010 genes with common cis-regulatory variation using analyses of allele-specific expression (ASE). Population genomic analyses of whole-genome sequences from 32 individuals showed that genes with common cis-regulatory variation are 1) under weaker purifying selection and 2) undergo less frequent positive selection than other genes. We further identified genomic determinants of cis-regulatory variation. Gene-body methylation (gbM) was a major factor constraining cis-regulatory variation, whereas presence of nearby TEs and tissue specificity of expression increased the odds of ASE. Our results suggest that most common cis-regulatory variation in C. grandiflora is under weak purifying selection, and that gene-specific functional constraints are more important for the maintenance of cis-regulatory variation than genome-scale variation in the intensity of selection. Our results agree with previous findings that suggest TE silencing affects nearby gene expression, and provide novel evidence for a link between gbM and cis-regulatory constraint, possibly reflecting greater dosage-sensitivity of body-methylated genes. Given the extensive conservation of gene-body methylation in flowering plants, this suggests that gene-body methylation could be an important predictor of cis-regulatory variation in a wide range of plant species.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PNAS/PNAS67.pdf,"[( 13 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 12 Dec 2015 , 5), ( 30 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 10 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 11 Dec 2015 , 6), ( 15 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 08 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 29 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 10 Dec 2015 , 8)]"

Bryan,  Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/066332 ,"Studies using multi-locus coalescent methods to infer species trees or historical demographic parameters usually require the assumption that the gene tree for each locus (or SNP) is genealogically independent from the gene trees of other sampled loci. In practice, however, researchers have used two different criteria to delimit independent loci in phylogenomic studies. The first criterion, which directly addresses the condition of genealogical independence of sampled loci, considers the long-term effects of homologous recombination and effective population size on linkage between two loci. In contrast, the second criterion, which only considers the single-generation effects of recombination in the meioses of individuals, identifies sampled loci as being independent of each other if they undergo Mendelian independent assortment. Methods that use these criteria to estimate the number of independent loci per genome as well as intra-chromosomal distance thresholds that can be used to delimit independent loci in phylogenomic datasets are reviewed. To compare the efficacy of each criterion, they are applied to two species (an invertebrate and vertebrate) for which relevant genetic and genomic data are available. Although the independent assortment criterion is relatively easy to apply, the results of this study show that it is overly conservative and therefore its use would unfairly restrict the sizes of phylogenomic datasets. It is therefore recommended that researchers only refer to genealogically independent loci when discussing the independent loci assumption in phylogenomics and avoid using terms that may conflate this assumption with independent assortment. Moreover, whenever feasible, researchers should use methods for delimiting putatively independent loci that take into account both homologous recombination and effective population size (i.e., long-term effective recombination).",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular Ecology/Molecular Ecology25.pdf,"[( 29 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 8)]"

Guilds are ecological groups of species that behave or react similarly to some environmental conditions. By modeling latent guild structure, we capture the cross-correlations in abundance or occurrence of species over surveys. In addition, ecological information about the community structure is obtained as a byproduct of the model. By clustering species into similar functional groups, prediction uncertainty of community structure at additional sites is reduced over treating each species separately. The method is illustrated with a small simulation demonstration, as well as an analysis of a mesopelagic fish survey from the eastern Bering Sea near Alaska. The simulation data analysis shows that guild membership can be extracted as the differences between groups become larger and if guild differences are small the model naturally collapses all the species into a small number of guilds which increases predictive efficiency by reducing the number of parameters to that which is supported by the data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1854.pdf,"[( 01 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 31 May 2016 , 6)]"

Peripheral blood CD4 and total lymphocyte counts, High vaginal swab microscopy, endocervical smears and cervical cytology were performed for each participant. Concentrations of six proinflammatory cytokines were measured on cervicovaginal lavage by multiplex cytometric bead array. The mean age of cases was 26.8 years and 30 years for controls. Total lymphocyte counts and CD4 cell counts were significantly higher among cases (p=0.02 and 0.004 respectively). HSV 2 prevalence as determined by ELISA was higher (p=0.034 among cases. The concentrations of the cytokines IL 1β, IL 6, IL 8, IL 12p70 and TNF α were lower among cases, with IL 1β being statistically significant (p=0.046). Concentrations of IL 10 was higher among cases (p=0.022). On multivariate analysis, reduction in IL 1β and IL 8 were associated with the duration of DMPA use (p=0.015 and 0.041 respectively). Inclusion of HSV 2 into the multivariate models showed elevation of all cytokines measured (p=<0.001). We conclude that DMPA use is associated with reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and elevation of the regulatory cytokine IL 10. This may explain increased female to male transmission of HIV infection by modulation of male genital tract mucosa in the absence of increased HIV 1 genital shedding.

In particular, it is still not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis must produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles, and therefore, underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function (LoF) alleles in eight independent datasets from modern human and Drosophila melanogaster populations.

Andrew,  USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center), (Hare, Matthew P.,  Cornell University)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/066662 ,"1. The challenges associated with monitoring low-density carnivores across large landscapes have limited the ability to implement and evaluate conservation and management strategies for such species.  Noninvasive sampling techniques and advanced statistical approaches have alleviated some of these challenges and can even allow for spatially explicit estimates of density, arguably the most valuable wildlife monitoring tool.  
2. For some species, individual identification comes at no cost when unique attributes (e.g., pelage patterns) can be discerned with remote cameras, while other species require viable genetic material and expensive lab processing for individual assignment.  Prohibitive costs may still force monitoring efforts to use species distribution or occupancy as a surrogate for density, which may not be appropriate under many conditions.  
3. Here, we used a large-scale monitoring study of fisher Pekania pennanti to evaluate the effectiveness of occupancy as an approximation to density, particularly for informing harvest management decisions.  We used a combination of remote cameras and baited hair snares during 2013-2015 to sample across a 70,096 km2 region of western New York, USA.  We fit occupancy and Royle-Nichols models to species detection-nondetection data collected by cameras, and spatial capture-recapture models to individual encounter data obtained by genotyped hair samples.  
4.	We found a close relationship between grid-cell estimates of fisher state variables from the models using detection-nondetection data and those from the SCR model, likely due to informative spatial covariates across a large landscape extent and a grid cell resolution that worked well with the movement ecology of the species.  Spatially-explicit management recommendations for fisher were similar across models.  We discuss design-based approaches to occupancy studies that can improve approximations to density.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Applied Ecology/Journal of Applied Ecology2.pdf,"[( 29 Jul 2016 , 5)]"

Here we interrogated whether a cross-fostered rat expressed his lack of motivation to help through any behaviors beyond not-helping. Accordingly, a cross-fostered rat was placed in an arena with a trapped rat and the door to the centrally located restrainer was taped shut. We found that cross-fostered rats moved more slowly and approached the trapped rat less than did control, regularly-raised rats tested under the same conditions. We then asked whether the behavior of the cross-fostered rats influenced the trapped rat. After being restrained with cross-fostered rats, trapped rats showed a decrease in exploratory behavior in an open field test compared to trapped rats who were raised normally. The same decrease in movement was observed after subject rats were allowed to freely interact with cross-fostered rats.

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low- to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimer′s brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimer′s disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimer′s disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimer′s subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.

However, the ability to obtain 3D profiles at kilobase resolution at low cost remains a major challenge. Therefore, we herein report a computational method to precisely identify chromatin interaction sites at kilobase resolution from MNase-seq data, termed chromatin interaction site detector (CISD), and a CISD-based chromatin loop predictor (CISD_loop) that predicts chromatin-chromatin interaction (CCI) from low-resolution Hi-C data. The methods are built on a hypothesis that CCIs result in a characteristic nucleosome arrangement pattern flanking the interaction sites. Accordingly, we show that the predictions of CISD and CISD_loop overlap closely with chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) anchors and loops, respectively. Moreover, the methods trained in one cell type can be applied to other cell types with high accuracy. The validity of the methods was further supported by chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments at 5kb resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that only modest amounts of MNase-seq and Hi-C data are sufficient to achieve ultrahigh resolution CCI map. The predictive power of CISD/CISD_loop supports the hypothesis that CCIs induce local nucleosome rearrangement and that the pattern may serve as probes for 3D dynamics of the genome.

Two distinct cellular events have been implicated in supplying regenerative neurogenesis with cellular material -- generation of new cells through cell proliferation and recruitment of already existing cells through cell migration. The relative contribution and importance of these two mechanisms is often unknown.

Methods: Here, we use the regenerating radial nerve cord (RNC) of the echinoderm Holothuria glaberrima as a model of extensive post-traumatic neurogenesis in the deuterostome central nervous system. To uncouple the effects of cell proliferation from those of cell migration, we treated regenerating animals with aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of S-phase DNA replication. Cell migration was tracked with vital staining with the lipophilic dye DiI.

Results: Aphidicolin treatment resulted in a significant 2.1-fold decrease in cell proliferation. In spite of this, the regenerating RNC in the treated animals did not differ in histological architecture, size and cell number from its counterpart in the control vehicle-treated animals. DiI labeling showed extensive cell migration in the RNC. Some cells migrated from as far as 2 mm away from the injury plane to contribute to the neural outgrowth.

Conclusions: We suggest that inhibition of cell division in the regenerating RNC of H. glaberrima is compensated for by recruitment of cells, which migrate into the RNC outgrowth from deeper regions of the neuroepithelium. Neural regeneration in echinoderms is thus a highly regulative developmental phenomenon, in which the size of the cell pool can be controlled either by cell proliferation or cell migration, and the latter can neutralize perturbations in the former.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Zoology/Frontiers in Zoology2.pdf,"[( 01 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 31 Jul 2016 , 2)]"

The process of domestication offers an excellent opportunity to disentangle the linkage between body and brain mass due to the extreme selection for increased body mass that has occurred. By breeding an intercross between domestic chicken and their wild progenitor, we address this relationship by simultaneously mapping the genes that control inter-population variation in brain mass and body mass. Loci controlling variation in brain mass and body mass have separate genetic architectures and are therefore not directly constrained. Genetic mapping of brain regions in the intercross indicates that domestication has led to a larger body mass and to a lesser extent a larger absolute brain mass in chickens, mainly due to enlargement of the cerebellum. Domestication has traditionally been linked to brain mass regression, based on measurements of relative brain mass, which confounds the large body mass augmentation due to domestication.

Tel1 is also required for efficient and timely initiation of resection. We find that distributions of resection endpoints at individual genomic loci display pronounced heterogeneity that reflects a tendency for nucleosomes to block Exo1 in vivo, yet modeling experiments indicate that Exo1 digests chromatin with high apparent processivity and at rates approaching those for naked DNA in vitro.

The lack of genetic differences between male and female alligators leaves open the question of how the genes responsible for sex determination and differentiation are regulated. One insight into this question comes from the fact that exposing an embryo incubated at male-producing temperature to estrogen causes it to develop ovaries. Because estrogen response elements are known to regulate genes over long distances, a contiguous genome assembly is crucial for predicting and understanding its impact.

We present an improved assembly of the American alligator genome, scaffolded with in vitro proximity ligation (Chicago) data. We use this assembly to scaffold two other crocodilian genomes based on synteny. We perform RNA sequencing of tissues from American alligator embryos to find genes that are differentially expressed between embryos incubated at male- versus female-producing temperature. Finally, we use the improved contiguity of our assembly along with the current model of CTCF-mediated chromatin looping to predict regions of the genome likely to contain estrogen-responsive genes.

Genomic data shed new light on transmission dynamics, and can be used to identify clusters of individuals likely to be linked by direct transmission. However, identification of individual routes of infection via single genome samples typically remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the potential of deep sequence data to provide greater resolution on transmission routes, via the identification of shared genomic variants. We assess several easily implemented methods to identify transmission routes using both shared variants and genetic distance, demonstrating that shared variants can provide considerable additional information in most scenarios. While shared variant approaches identify relatively few links in the presence of a small transmission bottleneck, these links are highly confident. Furthermore, we proposed hybrid approach additionally incorporating phylogenetic distance to provide greater resolution.

In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type V. fischeri and V. cholerae have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion-deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10-3/genome/generation. V. fischeri and V. cholerae have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection.

Independent courses of experimental evolution with a recombinant strain lacking E3L revealed several high frequency point mutations in conserved poxvirus genes, suggesting important roles for essential poxvirus proteins in innate immune subversion. Two distinct mutations were identified in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R, which seem to act through different mechanisms to increase virus replication. Specifically, a Leu18Phe substitution in A24R conferred fitness tradeoffs, including increased activation of the antiviral factor Protein kinase R (PKR). Intriguingly, this A24R variant underwent a drastic selective sweep during passaging, despite enhanced PKR activity. We show that the sweep of this variant can be accelerated by the presence of copy number variation (CNV) at the K3L locus, which with multiple copies strongly reduces PKR activation. Therefore, adaptive cases of CNV can also facilitate the accumulation of point mutations separate from the expanded locus.

Hansel and Gretel pose several advantages over existing solutions: the framework is capable of recovering haplotypes from metagenomes, does not require a priori knowledge about the input data, makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of alleles at variant sites, is robust to error, and uses all available evidence from aligned reads, without altering or discarding observed variation.

However, how PLK-1 phosphorylation regulates SPD-5 assembly is not known. We found that a mutant version of SPD-5 that is insensitive to PLK-1 phosphorylation (SPD-54A) could localize to PCM but was unable to rescue the reduction in PCM size and density when wild-type SPD-5 levels were decreased. In vitro, purified SPD-54A self-assembled into functional supramolecular scaffolds over long time scales, suggesting that phosphorylation only controls the rate of SPD-5 scaffold assembly. Furthermore, the SPD-5 scaffold, once assembled, remained intact and supported microtubule nucleation in the absence of PLK-1 activity in vivo. We conclude that Polo Kinase is required for rapid assembly of the PCM scaffold but not for scaffold maintenance or function. Based on this idea, we developed a theoretical model that adequately predicted PCM growth rates in different mutant conditions in vivo.

Although rarely studied, N deposition may also result in novel selective pressures on fungi, affecting evolutionary trajectories. To directly test if long-term N enrichment reshapes fungal behaviors, we isolated decomposer fungi from a long-term (28 year) N addition experiment and used a common garden approach to compare growth rates and decay abilities of isolates from control and N amended plots.

Changes in growth rates were idiosyncratic, but litter decay by N isolates was generally lower compared to control isolates of the same species, a response not readily reversed when N isolates were grown in control (low N) environments.

Two of three species pairs conformed to theoretical predictions stating that vertical transmission (VT) should maximize whole-organism fitness. Montipora aequituburculata (VT) exhibited greater net photosynthetic function, calcification rate and bleaching tolerance than its horizontally transmitting (HT) sister taxa Acropora millepora.

Studies of GRNs operating in early development of euechinoid sea urchins has revealed that little appreciable change has occurred since their divergence approximately 90 million years ago (mya). These observations suggest that strong conservation of GRN architecture has been maintained in early development of the sea urchin lineage. To test whether this is true for all sea urchins, comparative analyses of echinoid taxa that diverged deeper in geological time must be conducted. Recent studies highlighted extensive divergence of skeletogenic mesoderm specification in the sister clade of euechinoids, the cidaroids, suggesting that comparative analyses of cidaroid GRN architecture may confer a greater understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of developmental GRNs. Here, we report spatiotemporal patterning of 55 regulatory genes and perturbation analyses of key regulatory genes involved in euechinoid oral-aboral patterning of non-skeletogenic mesodermal and ectodermal domains in early development of the cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides. Our results indicate that developmental GRNs directing mesodermal and ectodermal specification have undergone marked alterations since the divergence of cidaroids and euechinoids. Notably, statistical and clustering analyses of echinoid temporal gene expression datasets indicate that regulation of mesodermal genes has diverged more markedly than regulation of ectodermal genes.

Methods: We introduce the double goods game to study the dynamics of these traits using evolutionary game theory. We model glycolytic acid production as a public good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF production as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results in three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic non-angiogenic.

Results: We classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes: (1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell types. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear goods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that considered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation.

Conclusion: The cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the importance of timing for anti-glycolysis treatments like lonidamine.

Here we study how plants can be trained to enhance their photoprotection and elaborate on the concept of the short-term illumination memory in Arabidopsis thaliana. By monitoring fluorescence emission dynamics we systematically observe the extent of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after previous light exposure to recognise and quantify the memory effect. We propose a simplified mathematical model of photosynthesis that includes the key components required for NPQ activation, which allows us to quantify the contribution to photoprotection by those components. Due to its reduced complexity, our model

Our results indicate that a basic mechanism of short-term light memory is preserved. The slow component, accumulation of zeaxanthin, accounts for the amount of memory remaining after relaxation in darkness, while the fast one, antenna protonation, increases quenching efficiency.

Identifying such patterns in large cancer studies thus helps the discovery of unknown interactions. Many studies use Fisher's exact test or simple permutation procedures for this purpose. These tests assume identical gene alteration probabilities across tumors, which is not true for cancer. We show that violating this assumption yields many spurious co-occurrences and misses many mutual exclusivities. We present DISCOVER, a novel statistical test that addresses the limitations of existing tests. In a comparison with six published mutual exclusivity tests, DISCOVER is more sensitive while controlling its false positive rate. A pan-cancer analysis using DISCOVER finds no evidence for widespread co-occurrence. Most co-occurrences previously detected do not exceed expectation by chance. In contrast, many mutual exclusivities are identified. These cover well known genes involved in the cell cycle and growth factor signaling. Interestingly, also lesser known regulators of the cell cycle and Hedgehog signaling are identified.

Species delimitation between the two clades was assessed by four parameters; posterior probability, Kimura two parameter (K2P), Rodrigos P (Randomly distinct) and Rosenbergs reciprocal monophyly (P(AB). The two clades within the phylogenetic tree showed evidence of distinctness based on; Kimura two parameters (K2P) (p = -1.21E-01), Rodrigos P (RD) (p =0.05) and Rosenbergs P(AB) (p = 2.3E -13).

Paradoxically, this treatment led to feedback-mediated suppression of a select group of mRNAs, including those encoding the ER chaperones BiP and GRP94. This suppression was due to both silencing of the ATF6α pathway of UPR-dependent transcription and enhancement of mRNA degradation, most likely via regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). The suppression of Bip mRNA was phenocopied by ectopic overexpression of BiP protein, and was also observed in obese mice.

Waning immunity promotes silent circulation by increasing poliovirus transmission from individuals not at risk of paralytic polio.  There is limited data on temporal patterns of waning.  Accordingly, we modeled a range of waning patterns, scaled from fast but shallow to slow but deep, while keeping constant the effect of waning on transmission dynamics before vaccination begins.  Besides waning, we varied overall transmissibility, the delay from beginning vaccination to reaching specified infection levels, and type specific virus characteristics.  We observed an increasing range of vaccination levels that resulted in long periods of silent circulation after eliminating paralytic polio cases as the delay in reaching final vaccination levels increased.  The extent of silent circulation was higher when waning was slower and deeper, when transmissibility was higher, and when virus was type 3.  In our model, modest levels of vaccination of adults reduce silent circulation risks.  These modeled patterns are consistent with very long silent circulation mainly emerging as a threat to OPV cessation in the last places from which polio cases are eliminated.  Our analyses indicate why previous modeling studies have not seen the threat of silent circulation.  They used models with no or very short duration waning and they lacked identifiability of waning effects on silent circulation because they fit models only to paralytic polio case counts.  Our analyses show that nearly identical polio case count patterns can be generated by a range of waning patterns that in turn generate diverse silent circulation risks.

In recent years, multi-electrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously from hundreds or thousands of electrodes packed with a high density. However, these new devices challenge the classical way to do spike sorting. Here we developed a new method to solve these issues, based on a highly automated algorithm to extract spikes from extracellular data, and show that this algorithm reached near optimal performance both in vitro and in vivo. The algorithm is composed of two main steps: 1) a ""template-finding"" phase to extract the cell templates, i.e. the pattern of activity evoked over many electrodes when one neuron fires an action potential; 2) a ""template-matching"" phase where the templates were matched to the raw data to find the location of the spikes. The manual intervention by the user was reduced to the minimal, and the time spent on manual curation did not scale with the number of electrodes. 
We tested our algorithm with large-scale data from in vitro and in vivo recordings, from 32 to 4225 electrodes.

The probability of existence and the number of evolutionary pathways that lead from a given genotype to a better-adapted genotype are important measures of accessibility of local fitness optima and the reproducibility of evolution. Both quantities have been studied in simple mathematical models where genotypes are represented as binary sequences of two types of basic units, and the network of permitted mutations between the genotypes is a hypercube graph. However, it is unclear how these results translate to the biologically relevant case in which genotypes are represented by sequences of more than two units, for example four nucleotides (DNA) or 20 aminoacids (proteins), and the mutational graph is not the hypercube. Here we investigate accessibility of the best-adapted genotype in the general case of K>2 units. Using computer generated and experimental fitness landscapes we show that accessibility of the global fitness maximum increases with K and can be much higher than for binary sequences. The increase in accessibility comes from the increase in the number of indirect trajectories exploited by evolution for higher K. As one of the consequences, the fraction of genotypes that are accessible increases by three orders of magnitude when the number of units K increases from 2 to 16 for landscapes of size N~106 genotypes.

Prior to the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, and recombine to ensure their proper disjunction at anaphase I. Additionally, telomeres tethered at the nuclear envelope cluster in the bouquet configuration where they are subjected to dramatic pulling forces acting from outside of the nucleus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomere-associated protein Ndj1 is required for bouquet formation. When Ndj1 is absent, these dramatic motions cease and multiple steps of meiosis I prophase progression are delayed. Here we identified Nup2 in a pool of enriched proteins that co-purify with tagged Ndj1 from meiotic cell extracts. Nup2 is a nonessential nucleoporin that functions in nuclear transport, boundary activity, and telomere silencing in mitotically dividing cells. We found that deletion of NUP2 delayed pairing and synapsis during meiosis, and led to decreased spore viability, similar to the ndj1Δ mutant phenotype. Surprisingly, the nup2Δ ndj1Δ double mutant failed to segregate chromosomes, even though the meiotic program continued. These results suggest that a physical impediment to nuclear division is created in the absence of Nup2 and Ndj1. Our deletion analysis of NUP2 identified a previously uncharacterized 125-amino acid region that is both necessary and sufficient to complement all of nup2Δ???s meiotic phenotypes, which we call the meiotic autonomous region (MAR). We propose that Ndj1 and Nup2 function in parallel pathways to promote the dynamic chromosome events of meiotic chromosome dynamics, perhaps through the establishment or maintenance of higher-order chromosome organization.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics95.pdf,"[( 06 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 05 Aug 2016 , 4)]"

When using northern blotting during these studies, we discovered that miRNA-length probes can have a ~360-fold bias against detecting even synthetic sequences that are 8 nt shorter. By using shorter probes and by performing hybridization and washes at low temperatures, we greatly reduced this bias to enable equivalent detection of 24 nt to 14 nt RNAs.

So far these approaches have been limited to the analysis of families of prokaryotic complexes for which large multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences can be compiled. We explore the hypothesis that co-evolution points to structurally conserved contacts at protein-protein interfaces, which can be reliably projected to homologous complexes with distantly related sequences. We introduce a novel domain-centred protocol to study the interplay between residue co-evolution and structural conservation of protein-protein interfaces. We show that sequence-based co-evolutionary analysis systematically identifies residue contacts at prokaryotic interfaces that are structurally conserved at the interface of their eukaryotic counterparts. In turn, this allows the prediction of conserved contacts at eukaryotic protein-protein interfaces with high confidence using solely mutational patterns extracted from prokaryotic genomes. Even in the context of high divergence in sequence (the twilight zone), where standard homology modelling of protein complexes is unreliable, our approach provides sequence-based accurate information about specific details of protein interactions at the residues level.

Here, we present data suggesting that force transduction through the actin filament is an important element of interaction within myosin-6 ensembles in vitro. Multiple myosin-6s coordinate their steps if they are separated by a short (and therefore high-force bearing) segment of actin. The measurements were performed using Fluorescence Interference Contrast Microscopy (FLIC) to measure small changes in the height of fluorescently labeled actin. Using FLIC, we assign the positions of myosins in a gliding filament assay geometry and measure their attachment time to actin. We also identify actin segments that are buckled or under tension. We show that myosin-6 holds actin about 10 nm above the surface. However, due to asynchronous myosin stepping, frequent buckles up to about 60 nm high appear. The buckle lifetime decreases as the distance between the myosin- 6s is reduced, a sign of inter-motor coordination. Our data are consistent with coordinated stepping of closely spaced myosins, but uncoordinated motility with widely separated myosins where buckles can form.

Taken together, these results suggest that the M. domestica immune response includes an unusual diversity of genes, perhaps as a consequence of its lifestyle in septic environments.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular Biology and Evolution/Molecular Biology and Evolution41.pdf,"[( 07 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 06 Aug 2016 , 8), ( 10 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

Such early computations may be dependent on compensative and adaptive mechanisms that stem from qualities intrinsic to the retinal neural circuit and its interaction with the environment (neural transduction time, connectivity patterns, regularities in the input signal, temporal dynamics and light variations).

They are found to occur very frequently in protein structures with their number exceeding that of π-helices, though it is considerably less than that of α-helices and β-strands.

Understanding how different species can evolve to interact in mutually beneficial ways is an important goal of evolutionary theory, especially when the benefits require costly investments by the partners. For such costly investments to evolve, some sort of fitness feedback mechanism must exist that more than recoups the direct costs. Several such feedback mechanisms have been explored both theoretically and empirically, yet we know relatively little how they might act together, as they probably do in nature. In this paper, I model the joint action of three of the main mechanisms that can maintain symbiotic cooperation: partner choice by hosts, population structure amongst symbionts, and undirected rewards from hosts to symbionts. My results show that population structure reduces the benefit from partner choice to hosts. It may help or hinder beneficial symbionts and create positive or negative frequency dependence depending on the nature of host rewards to the symbiont. Strong population structure also makes it less likely that host choosiness and symbiont cooperation will be jointly maintained in a population. The intuition behind my results is that all else being equal, population structure reduces local variation available to the host to choose from. Thus, population structure is not always beneficial for the evolution of cooperation between species. My results also underscore the need to do full analyses of multiple mechanisms of social evolution to uncover their interactions to uncover the interactions between them.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1898.pdf,"[( 09 Aug 2016 , 6), ( 15 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 08 Aug 2016 , 10)]"

Here we reconstruct the history of Ago2 duplications across the Drosophila obscura group, and use patterns of gene expression to infer new functional specialization. We show that some duplications are old, shared by the entire species group, and that losses may be common, including previously undetected losses in the lineage leading to D. pseudoobscura. We find that while the original (syntenic) gene copy has generally retained the ancestral ubiquitous expression pattern, most of the novel Ago2 paralogues have independently specialised to testis-specific expression. Using population genetic analyses, we show that most testis-specific paralogues have significantly lower genetic diversity than the genome-wide average. This suggests recent positive selection in three different species, and model-based analyses provide strong evidence of recent hard selective sweeps in or near four of the six D. pseudoobscura Ago2 paralogues. We speculate that the repeated evolution of testis-specificity in obscura group Ago2 genes, combined with their dynamic turnover and strong signatures of adaptive evolution, may be associated with highly derived roles in the suppression of transposable elements or meiotic drive. Our study highlights the lability of RNAi pathways, even within well-studied groups such as Drosophila, and suggests that strong selection may act quickly after duplication in RNAi pathways, potentially giving rise to new and unknown RNAi functions in non-model species.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics96.pdf,"[( 20 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 01 Apr 2016 , 16), ( 02 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 23 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

The performances of these two approaches have been well-studied in the specific context of proper model specification, i.e. when the inference model matches the simulation model. By contrast, the relative performances of one-rate vs. two-rate parameterizations when applied to data generated according to a different mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compare the relative merits of one-rate and two-rate approaches in the specific context of model misspecification by simulating alignments with mutation-selection models rather than with dN/dS-based models. We find that one-rate frameworks generally infer more accurate dN/dS point estimates, even when dS varies among sites. In other words, modeling dS variation may substantially reduce accuracy of dN/dS point estimates. These results appear to depend on the selective constraint operating at a given site. In particular, for sites under strong purifying selection (dN/dS<~0.3), one-rate and two-rate models show comparable performances. However, one- rate models significantly outperform two-rate models for sites under moderate-to-weak purifying selection. We attribute this distinction to the fact that, for these more quickly evolving sites, a given substitution is more likely to be nonsynonymous than synonymous. The data will therefore be relatively enriched for nonsynonymous changes, and modeling dS contributes excessive noise to dN/dS estimates. We additionally find that high levels of divergence among sequences, rather than the number of sequences in the alignment, are more critical for obtaining precise point estimates.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics97.pdf,"[( 20 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 25 Nov 2015 , 8), ( 24 Nov 2015 , 8), ( 23 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 31 Jan 2016 , 1)]"

Even with scaffolding information, many genome assemblies remain incomplete. The genome of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a fish model system in evolutionary genetics and genomics, is not completely assembled despite scaffolding with high-density linkage maps. Here, we first test the ability of a Hi-C based proximity guided assembly to perform a de novo genome assembly from relatively short contigs. Using Hi-C based proximity guided assembly, we generated complete chromosome assemblies from 50 kb contigs. We found that 98.99% of contigs were correctly assigned to linkage groups, with ordering nearly identical to the previous genome assembly. Using available BAC end sequences, we provide evidence that some of the few discrepancies between the Hi-C assembly and the existing assembly are due to structural variation between the populations used for the two assemblies or errors in the existing assembly. This Hi-C assembly also allowed us to improve the existing assembly, assigning over 60% (13.35 Mb) of the previously unassigned (~21.7 Mb) contigs to linkage groups. Together, our results highlight the potential of the Hi-C based proximity guided assembly method to be used in combination with short read data to perform relatively inexpensive de novo genome assemblies.

This study reports how two mutations that cause early-onset HCM, D239N and H251N, affect the mechanical output of human β-cardiac myosin at the molecular level. We observe extremely large increases (25% - 95%) in the actin gliding velocity, single molecule intrinsic force, and ATPase activity of the two mutant myosin motors compared to wild type myosin. In contrast to previous studies of HCM-causing mutations in human β-cardiac myosin, these mutations were striking in that they caused changes in biomechanical parameters that were both greater in magnitude and more uniformly consistent with a hyper-contractile phenotype. In addition, S1-S2 binding studies revealed a significant decrease in affinity of the H251N motor for S2, suggesting that this mutation may further increase hyper-contractility by releasing active motors from a sequestered state.

In both the cases, the calcium atoms were acquired from the crystallization solution, and data collection strategy was not optimized for exploiting the anomalous signal from these scatterers.  The X-ray data were collected at 0.98 Å in one case and at 1.74 Å in the other (wavelength optimized for sulfur but anomalous signal from Ca was exploited for structure solution).

Estimates of fishing and natural mortality are important for understanding, and ultimately managing, commercial and recreational fisheries. High reward tags with fixed station acoustic telemetry provides a promising approach to monitoring mortality rates in large lake recreational fisheries. Kootenay Lake is a large lake which supports an important recreational fishery for large Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout.

Methods. Between 2008 and 2013, 88 large (≥ 500 mm) Bull Trout and 149 large (≥ 500 mm) Rainbow Trout were marked with an acoustic transmitter and/or high reward ($100) anchor tags in Kootenay Lake. The subsequent detections and angler recaptures were analysed using a Bayesian individual state-space Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) survival model with indicator variable selection.

Results. The final CJS survival model estimated that the annual interval probability of being recaptured by an angler was 0.17 (95% CRI 0.11 - 0.23) for Bull Trout and 0.14 (95% CRI 0.09 - 0.19) for Rainbow Trout. The annual interval survival probability for Bull Trout was estimated to have declined from 0.91 (95% CRI 0.77 - 0.97) in 2009 to just 0.45 (95% CRI 0.24 - 0.73) in 2013. Rainbow Trout survival was most strongly affected by spawning. The annual interval survival probability was 0.77 (95% CRI 0.68 - 0.85) for a non-spawning Rainbow Trout compared to 0.42 (95% CRI 0.31 - 0.54) for a spawner. The probability of spawning increased with the fork length for both species and decreased over the course of the study for Rainbow Trout.

Discussion. Fishing mortality was relatively low and constant while natural mortality was relatively high and variable. The results are consistent with Kokanee abundance as opposed to angler effort as the primary driver of short-term population fluctations in Rainbow Trout abundance. Multi-species stock assessment models need to account for the fact that large Bull Trout are more abundant than large Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PeerJ/PeerJ26.pdf,"[( 08 Aug 2016 , 9)]"

However, despite their recreational and theoretical importance, little is known about the typical abundance of Ferox Trout.
Methods. To rectify this situation a 16 year angling-based mark-recapture study was conducted on Loch Rannoch, which at 19 km2 is one of the largest lakes in the United Kingdom.
Results. A hierarchical Bayesian Jolly-Seber analysis of the data suggest that if individual differences in catchability are negligible the population of Ferox Trout in Loch Rannoch in 2009 was approximately 71 fish. The results also suggest that a single, often unaccompanied, highly-experienced angler was able to catch roughly 8% of the available fish on an annual basis.

However, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are currently the primary focus of genetic studies of human disease. Here we quantify the degree to which SNPs are correlated with hypermutable loci by examining a range of mutation rates. We use established population genetics theory to relate mutation rates to recombination rates and compare the theoretical predictions to simulations. Both simulations and theory agree that, at the highest mutation rates, almost all correlation is lost between a hypermutable locus and surrounding SNPs. The theoretical predictions break down as the mutation rate increases, and consequently differ widely from the simulated results. The simulation results suggest that some correlation remains between SNPs and hypermutable loci when mutation rates are on the lower end of the mutation spectrum.

In order to understand the behavior of a RAD module we compute the exact time dependent distributions of the two expressed genes starting in one state and evolving to another asymptotic state. We consider two operating regimes of the RAD module: fast and slow stochastic switching. The fast regime is “aggregative” and produces unimodal distributions, whereas the slow regime is “separative” and produces bimodal distributions. Both regimes can serve to prepare pure memory states when all cells are expressing the same gene. The slow regime can also separate mixed states by producing two sub-populations each one expressing a different gene.

We analyzed the repair kinetics of this damage and identified mutants that modulate repair.

Equilibrium thermodynamic models are needed to describe the linkage between ligand binding and homo-oligomerization. These models must be parameterized in a way that makes physical interpretation straightforward, and allows elaborations or simplifications to be readily incorporated. We propose a systematic framework for the equilibrium analysis of ligand-linked oligomerization, treating in detail the case of a homo-oligomer with cyclic point group symmetry, where each subunit binds a ligand at a single site. Exploiting the symmetry of the oligomer, in combination with a nearest-neighbors approximation, we derive a class of site- specific ligand binding models involving only four parameters, irrespective of the size of the oligomer. The model parameters allow direct quantitative assessment of ligand binding cooperativity, and the influence of ligand binding on protein oligomerization, which are the key questions of biological interest. These models, which incorporate multiple types of linkage, are practically applicable, and we show how Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used to characterize the agreement of the model with experimental data. Simplifications to the model emerge naturally, as its parameters take on extremal values.

However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq have not been well developed. Available methods, which use prior information and/or simple brute-force comparisons, are slow and often result in over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender: an ultrafast and accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. To improve speed and reduce unnecessary pairwise comparisons, Bartender employs a divide-and-conquer strategy that intelligently sorts barcode reads into distinct bins before performing comparisons. To improve accuracy and reduce over-clustering artifacts, Bartender employs a modified two-sample proportion test that uses information on both the cluster sequence distances and cluster sizes to make merging decisions. Additionally, Bartender includes a ""multiple time point"" mode, which matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. For both simulated and real data, Bartender clusters millions of unique barcodes in a few minutes at high accuracy (>99.9%), and is ~100-fold faster than previous methods.

Their use, however, is often limited by the lack of high-resolution unbiased occurrence records. Echinococcus multilocularis is a parasitic cestode of public health importance which is widely distributed throughout Eurasia and is considered an emerging threat in North America. In common with many parasite species, available data for E. multilocularis occurrence are spatially biased and often poorly geo-referenced. 

Results: Here we produce three separate SDMs using MaxEnt for E. multilocularis using varying complexities of sampling schemes and environmental predictors, designed to make the best possible use of non-ideal occurrence data. The most realistic model utilized both derived and basic climatic predictors; an occurrence sampling scheme which relied primarily on high resolution occurrences from the literature and a bias grid to compensate for an apparently uneven research effort. All models predicted extensive regions of high suitability for E. multilocularis in North America, where the parasite is poorly studied and not currently under coordinated surveillance. 

Conclusions: Through a pragmatic approach to non-ideal occurrence data we were able to produce a statistically well supported SDM for an under-studied species of public health importance. Although the final model was only trained on data from Eurasia, the global model projection encompassed all known occurrences in the United States. The approach defined here may be applicable to many other such species and could provide useful information to direct resources for future field based surveillance programs for E. multilocularis in North America.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1915.pdf,"[( 10 Aug 2016 , 6), ( 11 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

The okra locus is not only of agricultural importance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), but through pioneering chimeric and morphometric studies it has contributed to fundamental knowledge about leaf development. Here we show that the major leaf shapes of cotton at the L-D1 locus are controlled by a HD-Zip transcription factor most similar to Late Meristem Identity1 (LMI1) gene. The classical okra leaf shape gene has 133-bp tandem duplication in the promoter, correlated with elevated expression, while an 8-bp deletion in the third exon of the presumed wild-type normal leaf causes a frame-shifted and truncated coding sequence. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of this LMI1-like gene in an okra variety was sufficient to induce normal leaf formation. An intermediate leaf shape allele, sub-okra, lacks both the promoter duplication and the exonic deletion.

The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a public health emergency in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) occurred during a period of severe drought and unusually high temperatures. Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Nino event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control. 

Results
Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Nino or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability. 

Conclusions
ZIKV response strategies adapted for a drought context in Brazil during El Nino 2015/2016 may need to be revised to accommodate the likely return of heavy rainfall associated with the probable 2016/2017 La Nina.

The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model for genotyping the lines, and by using state of the art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics67.pdf,"[( 25 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 24 Feb 2016 , 14), ( 23 Feb 2016 , 9)]"

We develop an evolutionary model which shows that selection for mitochondrial quality drives germline evolution. In organisms with low mitochondrial mutation rates, segregation of mutations over multiple cell divisions generates variation, allowing selection to optimize gamete quality through somatic gametogenesis. Higher mutation rates promote early germline sequestration. Oogamy reduces mitochondrial segregation in early development, improving adult fitness by restricting variation between tissues, but also limiting variation between early-sequestered oocytes, undermining gamete quality. Oocyte variation is restored through proliferation and random culling (atresia) of precursor cells. We predict a novel pathway from basal metazoans lacking a germline to active bilaterians with early sequestration of large oocytes subject to atresia, allowing the emergence of complex developmental processes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1916.pdf,"[( 09 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 08 Sep 2015 , 6), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

Here, we evaluate the use of selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) to sequence the P. falciparum genome from clinical DBS samples, and compare the results to current methods using leucodepleted VB. Parasite DNA with high (> 95%) human DNA contamination was selectively amplified by Phi29 polymerase using short oligonucleotide probes of 8-12 mers as primers.

It is now widely accepted that genetic processes such as inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation can increase the extinction risk of small populations. However, it is generally unclear whether extinction risk from genetic causes gradually increases with decreasing population size or whether there is a sharp transition around a specific threshold population size. In the ecological literature, such threshold phenomena are called ""strong Allee effects"" and they can arise for example from mate limitation in small populations.

2. In this study, we aim to a) develop a meaningful notion of a ""strong genetic Allee effect"", b) explore whether and under what conditions such an effect can arise from inbreeding depression due to recessive deleterious mutations, and c) quantify the interaction of potential genetic Allee effects with the well-known mate-finding Allee effect.

3. We define a strong genetic Allee effect as a genetic process that causes a population's survival probability to be a sigmoid function of its initial size. The inflection point of this function defines the critical population size. To characterize survival-probability curves, we develop and analyze simple stochastic models for the ecology and genetics of small populations.

4. Our results indicate that inbreeding depression can indeed cause a strong genetic Allee effect, but only if individuals carry sufficiently many deleterious mutations (lethal equivalents) on average and if these mutations are spread across sufficiently many loci. Populations suffering from a genetic Allee effect often first grow, then decline as inbreeding depression sets in, and then potentially recover as deleterious mutations are purged. Critical population sizes of ecological and genetic Allee effects appear to be often additive, but even superadditive interactions are possible.

5. Many published estimates for the number of lethal equivalents in birds and mammals fall in the parameter range where strong genetic Allee effects are expected. Unfortunately, extinction risk due to genetic Allee effects can easily be underestimated as populations with genetic problems often grow initially, but then crash later. Also interactions between ecological and genetic Allee effects can be strong and should not be neglected when assessing the viability of endangered or introduced populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Animal Ecology/Journal of Animal Ecology2.pdf,"[( 30 Jun 2016 , 6)]"

Background: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has rapidly become a valuable model as a result of the availability of a high quality reference genome, extensive genetic resources, and efficient gene transfer methodology.  A high-throughput method to obtain transgenic lines sooner than standard methods has the potential to greatly advance gene function studies.

Results: The goal of this study was to optimize our current gene transfer (transformation) method for tomato by investigating medium components that would result in a decreased time for recovery of transgenic lines.  The methodology reported here is based on infection of 6-day-old cotyledon explants from Solanum lycopersicum cultivar M82 in vitro-grown seedlings with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing the binary vector pBI121.  This vector contains the β-glucuronidase reporter gene and the neomycin phosphotransferase II selectable marker gene that confers resistance to kanamycin.  Modification of our standard plant regeneration medium by the addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at concentrations of either 0.05 mg/l or 0.1 mg/l greatly decreased the time for recovery of transgenic lines by 6 weeks as compared to our standard medium that contains zeatin alone.  Moreover, addition of 1 mg/l IAA to the root induction medium resulted in faster root development.  We observed 50% and 54% transformation efficiency when plant regeneration medium containing 0.05 mg/l and 0.1 mg/l IAA, respectively, was used for transformation experiments.  Transgenic lines recovered with the optimized method were similar in development to our standard method.  No negative effects were observed as a result of the addition of IAA to the medium.

Conclusions: The results showed that addition of IAA at concentrations of either 0.05 or 0.1 mg/l to the plant regeneration medium reduced the total time for recovery of stable transgenic lines by 6 weeks.  The ability to recover transgenic lines in a shorter time results in higher throughput for the introduction of gene constructs and has the potential to decrease the time needed to complete investigations of gene function.  The ability to recover transgenic lines for each gene construct in a shorter time saves labor and resource expenses because culture maintenance is also reduced.","/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture/Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture1.pdf","[( 03 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 06 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 16 May 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 02 Apr 2016 , 3)]"

Surprisingly, Crp was found to provide little to no protection of the DNA motif under activating conditions. Instead, Crp demonstrated binding patterns that closely resembled those generated by σ70. The binding patterns of both Crp and σ70 are indicative of RNAP holoenzyme DNA footprinting profiles associated with stages during transcription initiation that occur post-recruitment. This is marked by a pronounced advancement of the template strand footprint profile to the +20 position relative to the transcription start site and a multimodal distribution on the nontemplate strand.

The mechanisms underlying dopamine-induced increases in risky choice are unclear. In the current study we adopt a clinical-neuroeconomic approach to investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication on loss aversion during risky choice in depressed and non-depressed PD. Twenty-three healthy controls, 21 depressed and 22 non-depressed PD patients were assessed using a well-established gambling task measuring loss aversion during risky choice. Patients were tested on two occasions, after taking their normal dopaminergic medication (ON) and after withdrawal of their medication (OFF). Dopaminergic medication decreased loss aversion to a greater extent in depressed than non-depressed PD patients. Moreover, we show that the degree to which dopaminergic medication decreases loss aversion correlated with current depression severity and with drug effects on depression scores.

Previous studies of gene expression in purified immune cells have reported hundreds of genes showing enrichment in a single cell type, but the utility of these genes in tumor samples is unknown. We describe a novel statistical method for using co-expression patterns in large tumor gene expression datasets to validate previously reported candidate cell type marker genes, and we use this method to winnow previously published gene lists down to a subset of high confidence marker genes. Methods: We use co-expression patterns in 9986 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to validate previously reported cell type marker genes. We compare immune cell scores derived from these genes to measurements from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We characterize the reproducibility of our cell scores in replicate runs of RNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue. Results: We identify a list of 60 marker genes whose expression levels quantify 14 immune cell populations. Cell type scores calculated from these genes are concordant with flow cytometry and IHC readings, show high reproducibility in replicate RNA samples from FFPE tissue, and reveal an intricate picture of the immune infiltrate in TCGA. Most genes previously reported to be enriched in a single cell type have co-expression patterns inconsistent with cell type specificity.

The recently developed deep learning-based method DeepSEA uses DNA sequences to predict regulatory effects for up to 1000 functional units, namely regulatory elements and chromatin features in specific cell-types from the ENCODE project. 

Results: We here describe ""DeepWAS"", a conceptually new GWAS approach that integrates these predictions to identify SNP sets per functional units prior to association analysis based on multiple regression. To test the power of this approach, we use genotype data from a major depressive disorder (MDD) case/control sample (total N=1,537). DeepWAS identified 177 regulatory SNPs moderating 122 functional units. MDD regulatory SNPs were located mostly in promoters, intronic and distal intergenic regions and validated with public data.  Blood regulatory SNPs were experimentally annotated with methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs), expression quantitative trait methylation loci and expression QTLs and replicated in an independent cohort. Joint integrative analysis of regulatory SNPs and the independently identified annotations were connected through transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2C and ATF2, regulating a network of transcripts previously linked to other psychiatric disorders. In the latest GWAS for MDD, the MEF2C gene itself is within the top genome-wide significant locus. 

Conclusions: DeepWAS is a novel concept with the power to directly identify individual regulatory SNPs from genotypes. In a proof of concept study, MEF2C was identified as a master-regulator in major depression, a finding complementary to recent depression GWAS data, underlining the power of DeepWAS.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1924.pdf,"[( 18 Sep 2017 , 2), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 13 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 17 Sep 2017 , 2), ( 02 Oct 2016 , 3), ( 16 Sep 2017 , 4), ( 12 Aug 2016 , 11), ( 20 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 14 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 11 Aug 2016 , 9)]"

The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection.

These data provide information on possible transmission events which can be used for further epidemiologic analyses, such as identification of risk factors for infectivity and transmission. However, the relationship between transmission events and WGS data is obscured by uncertainty arising from four largely unobserved processes: transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics and mutation. To properly resolve transmission events, these processes need to be taken into account. Recent years have seen much progress in theory and method development, but applications are tailored to specific datasets with matching model assumptions and code, or otherwise make simplifying assumptions that break up the dependency between the four processes. To obtain a method with wider applicability, we have developed a novel approach to reconstruct transmission trees with WGS data. Our approach combines elementary models for transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics, and mutation. We use Bayesian inference with MCMC for which we have designed novel proposal steps to efficiently traverse the posterior distribution, taking account of all unobserved processes at once. This allows for efficient sampling of transmission trees from the posterior distribution, and robust estimation of consensus transmission trees. We implemented the proposed method in a new R package phybreak. The method performs well in tests of both new and published simulated data. We apply the model to to five datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, covering a wide range of epidemiological settings.

Enteric and other bacteria use subcellular organelles known as bacterial microcompartments to spatially organize the metabolism of pathogenicity-relevant carbon sources, such as 1,2-propanediol. The organelles are thought to sequester a private cofactor pool, minimize the effects of toxic intermediates, and enhance flux through the encapsulated metabolic pathways. We develop a mathematical model of the function of the
1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of Salmonella enterica and use it to analyze the function of the microcompartment organelles in detail. Our model makes accurate predictions of doubling times based on an optimized compartment shell permeability determined by maximizing metabolic flux in the model. The compartments function primarily to decouple cytosolic intermediate concentrations from the concentrations in the microcompartment, allowing significant enhancement in pathway flux by the generation of large concentration gradients across the
microcompartment shell. We find that selective permeability of the microcompartment shell is not absolutely necessary, but is often beneficial in establishing this intermediate-trapping function. Our findings also implicate active transport of the
1,2-propanediol substrate under conditions of low external substrate concentration, and we present a mathematical bound, in terms of external 1,2-proanediol substrate concentration and diffusive rates, on when active transport of the substrate is
advantageous. By allowing us to predict experimentally inaccessible aspects of microcompartment function, such as intra-microcompartment metabolite concentrations, our model presents avenues for future research and underscores the importance of carefully considering changes in external metabolite concentrations and other conditions during batch cultures. Our results also suggest that the encapsulation of heterologous pathways in bacterial microcompartments might yield significant benefits for pathway flux, as well as for toxicity mitigation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology79.pdf,"[( 15 Aug 2016 , 4)]"

We created a strain of Escherichia coli with all 123 instances of AGR codons removed from all essential genes. We readily replaced 110 AGR codons with the synonymous CGU, but the remaining thirteen ""recalcitrant"" AGRs required diversification to identify viable alternatives. Successful replacement codons tended to conserve local ribosomal binding site-like motifs and local mRNA secondary structure, sometimes at the expense of amino acid identity. Based on these observations, we empirically defined metrics for a multi-dimensional ""safe replacement zone"" (SRZ) within which alternative codons are more likely to be viable. To further evaluate synonymous and non-synonymous alternatives to essential AGRs, we implemented a CRISPR/Cas9-based method to deplete a diversified population of a wild type allele, allowing us to exhaustively evaluate the fitness impact of all 64 codon alternatives. Using this method, we confirmed relevance of the SRZ by tracking codon fitness over time in 14 different genes, finding that codons that fall outside the SRZ are rapidly depleted from a growing population.

Key concepts in community ecology, such as limiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion. However, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from simple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric, deterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different from the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic stochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the steady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three species, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a cascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a multiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have studied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species symmetry assumption.

David,  University of Miami)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/068510 ,"Gene expression is inherently noisy, but little is known about whether noise affects cell function or, if so, how and by how much. Here I present a theoretical framework that quantifies the fitness costs of gene expression noise and identifies the evolutionary and synthetic targets of noise attenuation. I find that gene expression noise reduces fitness by slowing the average rate of nutrient uptake and protein synthesis. This is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) kinetics of most biological reactions, which I show cause ""hyperbolic filtering"", a process that diminishes both the average rate and noise propagation of stochastic reactions. Interestingly, I find that transcriptional noise directly slows growth by slowing the average translation rate. Perhaps surprisingly, this is the largest fitness cost of transcriptional noise since translation strongly filters mRNA noise, making protein noise largely independent of transcriptional noise, consistent with empirical data. Translation, not transcription, then, is the primary target of protein noise control. Paradoxically, selection for protein-noise control favors increased ribosome-mRNA binding affinity, even though this increases translational bursting. However, I find that the efficacy of selection to suppress noise decays faster than linearly with increasing cell size. This predicts a stark, cell-size-mediated taxonomic divide in selection pressures for noise control: small unicellular species, including most prokaryotes, face fairly strong selection to suppress gene expression noise, whereas larger unicells, including most eukaryotes, experience extremely weak selection. I suggest that this taxonomic discrepancy in selection efficacy contributed to the evolution of greater gene-regulatory complexity in eukaryotes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1927.pdf,"[( 09 Aug 2016 , 7), ( 10 Aug 2016 , 8), ( 31 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

"August 14, 2016",Mapping eQTL by leveraging multiple tissues and DNA methylation,BMC Bioinformatics,"[(Acharya, Chaitanya R,  Duke University), (Owzar, Kouros,  Duke University), (Allen, Andrew S,  Duke University)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/069534 ,"Background: DNA methylation is an important tissue-specific epigenetic event that influences transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Differentially methylated CpG sites may act as mediators between genetic variation and gene expression, and this relationship can be exploited while mapping multi-tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Current multi-tissue eQTL mapping techniques are limited to only exploiting gene expression patterns across multiple tissues either in a joint tissue or tissue-by-tissue frameworks. We present a new statistical approach that enables us to model the effect of germ-line variation on tissue-specific gene expression in the presence of effects due to DNA methylation. 

Results: Our method efficiently models genetic and epigenetic variation to identify genomic regions of interest containing combinations of mRNA transcripts, CpG sites, and SNPs by jointly testing for genotypic effect and higher order interaction effects between genotype, methylation and tissues. We demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations that our approach, in the presence of both genetic and DNA methylation effects, gives an improved performance (in terms of statistical power) to detect eQTLs over the current eQTL mapping approaches. When applied to an array-based dataset from 150 neuropathologically normal adult human brains, our method identifies eQTLs that were undetected using standard tissue-by-tissue or joint tissue eQTL mapping techniques. As an example, our method identifies eQTLs in a BAX inhibiting gene (TMBIM1), which may have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.  

Conclusions: Our score test-based approach does not need parameter estimation under the alternative hypothesis. As a result, our model parameters are estimated only once for each mRNA - CpG pair. Our model specifically studies the effects of non-coding regions of DNA (in this case, CpG sites) on mapping eQTLs. However, we can easily model micro-RNAs instead of CpG sites to study the effects of post-transcriptional events in mapping eQTL. Our model's flexible framework also allows us to investigate other genomic events such as alternative gene splicing by extending our model to include gene isoform-specific data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics39.pdf,"[( 15 Aug 2016 , 12)]"

If the full peptide sequence is known then over 98% of the proteins in the proteome can be identified from such sequences. The rate exceeds 78% if the positions of four internal residue types are known. When the standard set of 20 amino acids is replaced with an alphabet of size four based on residue volume the identification rate exceeds 96%.

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed developments concerns models that better account for the effect of within- and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and non-ultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates all previous classical models of univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages co-evolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) analyzes dozens or hundreds of recessive genes for determining reproductive risk. Data on clinical utility of screening conditions beyond professional guidelines is scarce. 

Methods:
Individuals underwent ECS for up to 110 genes. 537 at-risk couples (ARC), those in which both partners carry the same recessive disease, were invited to a retrospective IRB-approved survey of their reproductive decision making after receiving ECS results.

Results:
64 eligible ARC completed the survey. Of 45 respondents screened preconceptionally, 62% (n=28) planned IVF with PGD or prenatal diagnosis (PNDx) in future pregnancies. 29% (n=13) were not planning to alter reproductive decisions. The remaining 9% (n=4) of responses were unclear. 
Of 19 pregnant respondents, 42% (n=8) elected PNDx, 11% (n=2) planned amniocentesis but miscarried, and 47% (n=9) considered the condition insufficiently severe to warrant invasive testing. Of the 8 pregnancies that underwent PNDx, 5 were unaffected and 3 were affected. 2 of 3 affected pregnancies were terminated.
Disease severity was found to have significant association (p=0.000145) with changes in decision making, whereas guideline status of diseases, controlled for severity, was not (p=0.284).

Conclusion:
Most ARC altered reproductive planning, demonstrating the clinical utility of ECS. Severity of conditions factored into decision making.

The current study investigated how structural brain correlates of components of the working memory system change over developmental time. Verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory were assessed in 153 children between 6 and 16 years and latent components of the working memory system were derived using principal component analysis. Further, fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness maps were derived from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI and processed using eigenanatomy decomposition, an advanced dimensionality reduction method for neuroimaging data.

Regression modelling indicated greater involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior temporal white matter in younger children for performance associated with the executive part of the working memory system, while thickness of the occipitotemporal cortex was more predictive in older children.

For many organisms estimates of evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of recombination. The majority (28/36) of data sets possessed sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not possible even with “ancient DNA” data sampled over many centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude, from 10-6 to 10-8 nucleotide substitutions site-1 year-1. This variation was largely attributable to sampling time, which was strongly negatively associated with estimated evolutionary rates, with this relationship best described by an exponential decay curve.

Linking potential metabolisms to phylogeny in environmental microorganisms is important for interpreting microbial community functions and the impacts these communities have on geochemical cycles.

Binning methods have been implemented with varying approaches such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and two-way clustering; however, many of these suffer from biases against low coverage/abundance organisms and closely related taxa/strains. We are introducing a new binning method, BinSanity, that utilizes the clustering algorithm affinity propagation (AP), to cluster assemblies using coverage alone, removing potential composition based biases in clustering contigs, but requires a minimum of two samples. To increase fidelity, a refinement script was developed that uses composition data (tetranucleotide frequency and %G+C content) to refine bins containing multiple source organisms. This separation of composition and coverage based signatures reduces clustering bias for closely related taxa. BinSanity was developed and tested on artificial metagenomes varying in size and complexity.

We show through large data analyses that although many ribosomal proteins are essential with consistent effect on growth in different conditions in yeast and similar expression across cell and tissue types in mice and humans, some ribosomal proteins are used in an environment specific manner. The latter set of variable ribosomal proteins further function in a coordinated manner forming modules, which are adapted to different environmental cues in different organisms. We show that these environment specific modules of ribosomal proteins in yeast have differential genetic interactions with other pathways and their 5'UTRs show differential signatures of selection in yeast strains, presumably to facilitate adaptation. Similarly, we show that in higher metazoans such as mice and humans, different modules of ribosomal proteins are expressed in different cell types and tissues. A clear example is nervous tissue that uses a ribosomal protein module distinct from the rest of the tissues in both mice and humans. Our results suggest a novel stratification of ribosomal proteins that could have played a role in adaptation, presumably to optimize translation for adaptation to diverse ecological niches and tissue microenvironments.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE163.pdf,"[( 03 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 16 Aug 2016 , 27), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 17), ( 18 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

We propose a Hybrid Structural variant Assembly (HySA) approach that integrates sequencing reads from next generation sequencing (NGS) and single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies to accurately assemble and detect structural variations (SV) in human genome. By identifying homologous SV-containing reads from different technologies through a bipartite-graph-based clustering algorithm, our approach turns a whole genome assembly problem into a set of independent SV assembly problems, each of which can be effectively solved to enhance assembly of structurally altered regions in human genome.
In testing our approach using data generated from a haploid hydatidiform mole genome (CHM1) and a diploid human genome (NA12878), we found that our approach substantially improved the detection of many types of SVs, particularly novel large insertions, small INDELs (10-50bp) and short tandem repeat expansions and contractions over existing approaches with a low false discovery rate.

FOXA1 binds to enhancers regions that are enriched in H3K4mono- and dimethylation (H3K4me1, H3K4me2) histone marks and evidence suggests that these marks are requisite events for FOXA1 to associate with enhancers to initate subsequent gene expression events. However, exogenous expression of FOXA1 has been shown to induce H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 signal at enhancer elements and the order of events and the functional importance of these events is not clear. We performed a FOXA1 Rapid Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry of Endogenous Proteins (RIME) screen in ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in order to identify FOXA1 interacting partners and we found histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (MLL3) as the top FOXA1 interacting protein. MLL3 is typically thought to induce H3K4me3 at promoter regions, but recent findings suggest it may contribute to H3K4me1 deposition, in line with our observation that MLL3 associates with an enhancer specific protein. We performed MLL3 ChIP-seq in breast cancer cells and unexpectedly found that MLL3 binds mostly at non-promoter regions enhancers, in contrast to the prevailing hypothesis. MLL3 was shown to occupy regions marked by FOXA1 occupancy and as expected, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2. MLL3 binding was dependent on FOXA1, indicating that FOXA1 recruits MLL3 to chromatin. Motif analysis and subsequent genomic mapping revealed a role for Grainy head like protein-2 (GRHL2) which was shown to co-occupy regions of the chromatin with MLL3. Regions occupied by all three factors, namely FOXA1, MLL3 and GRHL2, were most enriched in H3K4me1. MLL3 silencing decreased H3K4me1 at enhancer elements, but had no appreciable impact on H3K4me3 at enhancer elements. We identify a complex relationship between FOXA1, MLL3 and H3K4me1 at enhancers in breast cancer and propose a mechanism whereby the pioneer factor FOXA1 can interact with a chromatin modifier MLL3, recruiting it to chromatin to facilitate the deposition of H3K4me1 histone marks, subsequently demarcating active enhancer elements.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Cell Reports/Cell Reports18.pdf,"[( 05 Sep 2016 , 3), ( 16 Aug 2016 , 4), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 06 Sep 2016 , 2)]"

The E. coli Rho factor is an exemplar hexameric RNA translocase that terminates transcription in bacteria. Like many ring-shaped motor proteins, Rho activity is modulated by a variety of poorly understood mechanisms, including small molecule therapeutics, protein-protein interactions, and the sequence of its translocation substrate. Here, we establish the mechanism of action of two Rho effectors, the antibiotic bicyclomycin and nucleic acids that bind to Rho's 'primary' mRNA recruitment site. Using SAXS and a novel reporter assay to monitor the ability of Rho to switch between open-ring (RNA loading) and closed-ring (RNA translocation) states, bicyclomycin is found to be a direct antagonist of ring closure. Reciprocally, the binding of nucleic acids to its N-terminal RNA recruitment domains is shown to promote the formation of a closed-ring Rho state, with increasing primary site occupancy providing additive stimulatory effects. This study establishes bicyclomycin as a conformational inhibitor of Rho ring dynamics, highlighting the utility of developing assays that read out protein conformation as a prospective screening tool for ring-ATPase inhibitors.

Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. One model is that yeast viruses are subject to degradation simply as a result of the intrinsic exonuclease activity of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Contrary to this model, we find a highly refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the double-stranded L-A totivirus of different Saccharomyces yeast species.  We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with yeast viruses, where Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii being most efficient at controlling the L-A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii.  All Xrn1p orthologs are equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon. Thus, the activity of Xrn1p against  totiviruses is not an incidental consequence of the enzymatic activity of Xrn1p, but rather Xrn1p co-evolves with totiviruses to maintain its potent antiviral activity and limit viral propagation in Saccharomyces yeasts. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that Xrn1p physically interacts with the Gag protein encoded by the L-A virus, suggesting a host-virus interaction that is more involved that Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Pathogens/PLOS Pathogens11.pdf,"[( 06 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 17 Aug 2016 , 10), ( 18 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

The cysteine protease separase cleaves a subunit of the cohesin complex to allow chromosome segregation at anaphase onset. Separase also regulates meiotic cortical granule exocytosis and vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis, both of which involve RAB-11. Separase has non-proteolytic signaling functions in addition to its role in substrate cleavage, and its mechanism in exocytosis is unknown. We sought to determine whether separase regulates RAB-11 vesicle exocytosis through a proteolytic or non-proteolytic mechanism. To address this question, we generated a protease-dead separase, SEP-1PD::GFP, and unexpectedly found that it is dominant negative. Consistent with its role in cohesin cleavage, SEP-1PD::GFP causes chromosome segregation defects. Depletion of the substrate subunit of cohesin rescues this defect, suggesting that SEP-1PD::GFP impairs cohesin cleavage by a substrate trapping mechanism. We investigated whether SEP-1PD::GFP also impairs RAB-11 vesicle trafficking. SEP-1PD::GFP causes a low rate of cytokinesis failure that is synergistically exacerbated by depletion of the core exocytic t-SNARE protein SYX-4. Interestingly, SEP-1PD::GFP  causes an accumulation of RAB-11 vesicles at the cleavage furrow site and delayed the exocytosis of cortical granules during anaphase I. Depletion of SYX-4 further enhanced RAB-11::mCherry and SEP-1PD::GFP plasma membrane accumulation during cytokinesis.

Targeted genome enrichment in cattle identified varying levels of allelic polymorphism between these NKC genes concentrated in the predicted extracellular ligand binding domains. This novel recombination and allelic polymorphism is consistent with NKC evolution under balancing selection, suggesting this diversity influences individual immune responses and may impact on differential outcomes of pathogen infection and vaccination.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Immunogenetics/Immunogenetics2.pdf,"[( 17 Aug 2016 , 11)]"

A Soviet industrial production facility in Sverdlovsk proved deficient in 1979 when a plume of spores was accidentally released and resulted in one of the largest known human anthrax outbreak. In order to understand this outbreak and others, we have generated a B. anthracis population genetic database based upon whole genome analysis to identify all SNPs across a reference genome. Only ~12,000 SNPs were identified in this low diversity species and represents the breadth of its known global diversity. Phylogenetic analysis has defined three major clades (A, B and C) with B and C being relatively rare compared to A. The A clade has numerous subclades including a major polytomy named the Trans-Eurasian (TEA) group. The TEA radiation is a dominant evolutionary feature of B. anthracis, many contemporary populations, and must have resulted from large-scale dispersal of spores from a single source. Two autopsy specimens from the Sverdlovsk outbreak were deeply sequenced to produce draft B. anthracis genomes. This allowed the phylogenetic placement of the Sverdlovsk strain into a clade with two Asian live vaccine strains, including the Russian Tsiankovskii strain.

Using thousands of fully sequenced pneumococcal genomes, we confirm that pneumococcal populations are highly genetically structured and that there is significant variation among diverged populations in pherotype frequencies; most carry only a single pherotype. Moreover, we find that the relative frequencies of the two dominant pherotypes significantly vary within a small range across geographical sites. It has been variously proposed that pherotypes either promote genetic exchange among cells expressing the same pherotype, or conversely that they promote recombination between strains bearing different pherotypes. We distinguish these hypotheses using a bioinformatics approach by estimating recombination frequencies within and between pherotypes across 4,089 full genomes. Despite underlying population structure, we observe extensive recombination between populations; additionally, we found significantly higher rates of genetic exchange between strains expressing different pherotypes than among isolates carrying the same pherotype.

We discovered that common genetic variations may contribute to increasing gene expression variability via two distinct modes of action--epistasis and destabilization.

HIV patients are more likely to contract bacterial pneumonia and more likely to die from the infection. Unfortunately, there are few tests to quickly diagnosis the etiology of these dangerous infections. Several biomarkers may be useful for diagnosing the most common pneumonia-causing organism, S. pneumoniae, but studies utilizing the standard statistical approach provide little concrete guidance for the HIV-infected population.

Methodology and Findings 

Using a Bayesian approach, I analyze data from a cohort of 280 HIV patients with x-ray confirmed community acquired pneumonia. First, I use a variety of techniques to establish predictor significance and to identify their optimal cutoffs. Next, in lieu of cutoffs, I find the continuous and combined likelihood ratios for every value of each biomarker, and I compute the associated posttest probabilities. As expected, I find the three biomarkers with good clinical yield and a statistically significant association with S. pneumoniae are C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lytA gene PCR (lytA). Based on Bayesian clinical yield, optimal cutoffs are largely equivocal. The optimal dichotomous cutoff for CRP is essentially any value between 10 mg/dL and 30 mg/dL (∆pposttest ≈ 0.49). The optimal cutoff for PCT is any value between 2 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL (∆pposttest ≈ 0.35). The optimal cutoff for lytA is any value less than 6 log10 copies/mL (∆pposttest ≈ 0.45). Further, I find that continuous likelihood ratios provide much more accurate posttest probabilities than dichotomous cutoffs. For example, starting with the empirical pretest probability, a lytA approaching 0 copies/mL lowers the probability of S. pneumoniae infection to less than 15%, while a result of 10 copies/mL raises the probability to greater than 65%. However, a lytA value just above or below the suggested cutoff of 8000 copies/mL or my new optimal cutoff of 30, 000 copies/mL leaves the posttest probability of infection essentially unchanged from the pretest probability.

Conclusion

CRP, PCT, and lytA all provide significant value in diagnosing the etiology of pneumonia in HIV patients. The optimal dichotomous cutoffs for lytA, CRP, and PCT need to be adjusted for pneumococcal diagnosis in this population. However, continuous and combined likelihood ratios avoid discarding valuable quantitative information, and a combined likelihood ratio can be easily computed without the need for prior logistic regression. Importantly, there is significant overlap between these biomarkers such that only one of the three biomarkers at a time should be used to update clinical probabilities. Thus, it is ill-advised to combine the likelihood ratios of different biomarkers to produce a posttest probability. Finally, I provide a simple web application to quantitatively calculate the posttest probability of S. pneumoniae infection in HIV patients with x-ray confirmed pneumonia: http://meyerapps.org/pneumococcal_etiology_hiv.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1942.pdf,"[( 18 Aug 2016 , 5), ( 19 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

During the domestication of maize from its wild ancestor (teosinte), an allelic substitution at teosinte branched (tb1) caused changes in both plant and ear architecture.  The effects of tb1 on phenotype were shown to depend on multiple background loci including one called enhancer of tb1.2 (etb1.2).  We mapped etb1.2 to a YABBY class transcription factor (ZmYAB2.1) and showed that the maize alleles of ZmYAB2.1 are either expressed at a lower level than teosinte alleles or disrupted by insertions in the sequences.   tb1 and etb1.2 interact epistatically to control the length of internodes within the maize ear which affects how densely the kernels are packed on the ear.  The interaction effect is also observed at the level of gene expression with tb1 acting as a repressor of ZmYAB2.1 expression.  Curiously, ZmYAB2.1 was previously identified as a candidate gene for another domestication trait in maize, non-shattering ears.  Consistent with this proposed role, ZmYAB2.1 is expressed in a narrow band of cells in immature ears that appears to represent a vestigial abscission (shattering) zone.  Expression in this band of cells may also underlie the effect on internode elongation. The identification of ZmYAB2.1 as a background factor interacting with tb1 is a first step toward a gene-level understanding of how tb1 and the background within which it works evolved in concert during maize domestication.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics99.pdf,"[( 18 Aug 2016 , 7), ( 19 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

Post-translational modifications of histone residue tails are an important component of genome regulation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the combinatorial presence and absence of various modifications define discrete chromatin states which determine the functional properties of a locus. An emerging experimental goal is to track changes in chromatin state maps across different conditions, such as experimental treatments, cell-types or developmental time points.
Results:
Here we present chromstaR, an algorithm for the computational inference of combinatorial chromatin state dynamics across an arbitrary number of conditions. ChromstaR uses a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to determine the number of discrete combinatorial chromatin states using multiple ChIP-seq experiments as input and assigns every genomic region to a state based on the presence/absence of each modification in every condition. We demonstrate the advantages of chromstaR in the context of three common experimental data scenarios. First, we study how different histone modifications combine to form combinatorial chromatin states in a single tissue. Second, we infer genome-wide patterns of combinatorial state differences between two cell types or conditions. Finally, we study the dynamics of combinatorial chromatin states during tissue differentiation involving up to six differentiation points. Our findings reveal a striking sparcity in the combinatorial organization and temporal dynamics of chromatin state maps.

However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable.  Mtb susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive Mtb clearance.  Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination.

Over the past decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced, contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses and, in general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome. 

Some de novo assemblies have been constructed, free of reference bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci into single ‘consensus’ sequences, generally absent from nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was generated using Sanger sequencing and one using thousands of clone pools.

Here we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies.  We make a single library from ~1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using the 10x Genomics microfluidic platform to partition the genome. We applied this technique to seven human samples, generating low-cost HiSeq X data, then assembled these using a new ‘pushbutton’ algorithm, Supernova.

A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference databases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability.
2.	In this paper we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals, and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (from 800 to 130 000 species), and variation in the completeness of the reference databases (representing 15% to 100% of the species).
3.	Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased assessment of probabilities of taxonomic placement, and thus that its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence databases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels.
4.	Our results show that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging, and thus neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference.

Although many studies have investigated the impacts of local and global stressors on coral reefs, we still do not fully understand how these stressors influence coral community structure, particularly across environmental gradients on a reef system. Here, we investigate coral community composition across three different temperature and productivity regimes along a nearshore-offshore gradient on lagoonal reefs of the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). A novel metric was developed using ultra-high-resolution satellite-derived estimates of sea surface temperatures (SST) to classify reefs as exposed to low (lowTP), moderate (modTP), or high (highTP) temperature parameters over 10 years (2003 to 2012). Coral species richness, abundance, diversity, density, and percent cover were lower at highTP sites relative to lowTP and modTP sites, but these coral community traits did not differ significantly between lowTP and modTP sites. Analysis of coral life history strategies revealed that highTP sites were dominated by hardy stress tolerant and fast-growing weedy coral species, while lowTP and modTP sites consisted of competitive, generalist, weedy, and stress-tolerant coral species. Satellite-derived estimates of Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were obtained for 13-years (2003-2015) as a proxy for primary production. Chl-a concentrations were highest at highTP sites, medial at modTP sites, and lowest at lowTP sites. Notably, thermal parameters correlated better with coral community traits between site types than productivity, suggesting that temperature (specifically number of days above the thermal bleaching threshold) played a greater role in defining coral community structure than productivity on the MBRS. Dominance of weedy and stress-tolerant genera at highTP sites suggests that corals utilizing these two life history strategies may be better suited to cope with warmer oceans and thus may warrant protective status under climate change.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE164.pdf,"[( 08 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jan 2016 , 4), ( 27 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 21 Jan 2016 , 3), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

The growth-suppressive effect of CD44 is mediated by its extracellular domain and is independent of its hyaluronan binding function.

Our goal was to determine if the abundances of certain microorganisms reflect dysbiosis or a specific clinical condition that could be used as a signature for dental research.  Microbial abundances were determined by the analysis of 138,718 calibrated probes using Gene Meter methodology.  Each 16S rRNA gene was targeted by an average of 194 unique probes (n=25 nt).  The calibration involved diluting pooled gene target samples, hybridizing each dilution to a DNA microarray, and fitting the probe intensities to adsorption models.  The fit of the model to the experimental data was used to assess individual and aggregate probe behavior; good fits (R2>0.90) were retained for back-calculating microbial abundances from patient samples. The abundance of a gene was determined from the median of all calibrated individual probes or from the calibrated abundance of all aggregated probes.  With the exception of genes with low abundances (< 2 arbitrary units), the abundances determined by the different calibrations were highly correlated (r ~1.0).  Seventeen genera were classified as signatures of dysbiosis because they had significantly higher abundances in patients with periodontitis and edentulism when contrasted with health.

These assays involve combined cell migration and cell proliferation processes, both of which are modulated by cell-to-cell crowding.  Previous discrete models of collective cell migration assays involve a nearest-neighbour proliferation mechanism where crowding effects are incorporated by aborting potential proliferation events if the randomly chosen target site is occupied.  There are two limitations of this traditional approach: (i) it seems unreasonable to abort a potential proliferation event based on the occupancy of a single, randomly chosen target site; and, (ii) the continuum limit description of this mechanism leads to the standard logistic growth function, but some experimental  evidence suggests that cells do not always proliferate logistically. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a generalised proliferation mechanism which allows non-nearest neighbour proliferation events to take place over a template of r ≥ 1 concentric rings of  lattice sites. Further,  the decision to abort potential proliferation events is made using a crowding function, f(C), which accounts for the density of agents within a group of sites rather than dealing with the occupancy of a single randomly chosen site. Analysing the continuum limit description of the stochastic model shows that the standard logistic source term, λC(1 – C), where λ is the proliferation rate, is generalised to a universal growth function, λCf(C).

As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of datasets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models--often severely.

Multiple proteins have been suggested as targets for strigolactone signalling, including both direct proteolytic targets of SCFMAX2, and downstream targets. However, the relevance and importance of these proteins to strigolactone signalling in many cases has not been fully established. Here we assess the contribution of these targets to strigolactone signalling in adult shoot developmental responses. We find that all examined strigolactone responses are regulated by SCFMAX2 and D14, and not by other D14-like proteins. We further show that all examined strigolactone responses likely depend on degradation of SMXL proteins in the SMXL6 clade, and not on other proposed proteolytic targets. Taken together, our results suggest that in the adult shoot, the dominant mode of strigolactone signalling is D14-initiated, MAX2-mediated degradation of SMXL6-related proteins.

ZIKV was isolated from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly, and recent studies in mice models revealed that ZIKV infection may cause brain defects by influencing brain cell developments.

Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalizing the functional connectivity patterns showed that the topographical structure remained similar across depths of anesthesia, resembling the functional association of the underlying cortical areas.

In a global human dataset, localized heterogeneity is likely explained by polymorphic chromosomal inversions. In a range-wide dataset of Medicago truncatula, factors that produce heterogeneity are shared between chromosomes, correlate with local gene density, and may be caused by background selection or local adaptation. In a dataset of primarily African Drosophila melanogaster, large-scale heterogeneity across each chromosome arm is explained by known chromosomal inversions thought to be under recent selection, and after removing samples carrying inversions, remaining heterogeneity is correlated with recombination rate and gene density, again suggesting a role for linked selection.

We present a generic, hierarchical identification system for automated taxonomic approximation of organisms from images. We assessed the effectiveness of this system using photographs of slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae), for which we implemented image pre-processing, segmentation, and colour and shape feature extraction algorithms to obtain digital phenotypes for 116 species.

Several studies have shown their importance in cancer, cell pluripotency and motility. Many programs have recently been developed to identify chimeras from Illumina RNA-seq data (mostly fusion genes in cancer). However outputs of different programs on the same dataset can be widely inconsistent, and tend to include many false positives. Other issues relate to simulated datasets restricted to fusion genes, real datasets with limited numbers of validated cases, result inconsistencies between simulated and real datasets, and gene rather than junction level assessment. 

Results: Here we present ChimPipe, a modular and easy-to-use method to reliably identify chimeras from paired-end Illumina RNA-seq data. We have also produced realistic simulated datasets for three different read lengths, and enhanced two gold-standard cancer datasets by associating exact junction points to validated gene fusions. Benchmarking ChimPipe together with four other state-of-the-art tools on this data showed ChimPipe to be the top program at identifying exact junction coordinates for both kinds of datasets, and the one showing the best trade-off between sensitivity and precision. Applied to 106 ENCODE human RNA-seq datasets, ChimPipe identified 137 high confidence chimeras connecting the protein coding sequence of their parent genes. In subsequent experiments, three out of four predicted chimeras, two of which recurrently expressed in a large majority of the samples, could be validated. Cloning and sequencing of the three cases revealed several new chimeric transcript structures, 3 of which with the potential to encode a chimeric protein for which we hypothesized a new role.

However, DNA methylation is sparsely studied in insects. Therefore, we documented patterns of DNA methylation across a wide diversity of insects. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the DNA methylation system will be associated with presence/absence of sociality among insects. We also predicted that underlying enzymatic machinery is concordant with patterns of DNA methylation. We found DNA methylation to be widespread, detected in all orders examined except Diptera (flies). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing showed that orders differed in levels of DNA methylation. Hymenopteran (ants, bees, wasps and sawflies) had some of the lowest levels, including several potential losses. Blattodea (cockroaches) show all possible patterns, including a potential loss of DNA methylation in a eusocial species whereas solitary species had the highest levels. Phylogenetically corrected comparisons revealed no evidence that supports evolutionary dependency between sociality and DNA methylation. Species with DNA methylation do not always possess the typical enzymatic machinery. We identified a gene duplication event in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that is shared by some hymenopteran, and paralogs have experienced divergent, non-neutral evolution.

To assess whether choice biases pervade other perceptual decision scenarios, we asked humans to perform a simple common perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives. We found that participants did not choose the two alternatives equally often, which is consistent with the occurrence of choice biases, but also with the occurrence of sensory biases. To test these possibilities, participants performed the task reversing the mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. With this simple manipulation, participants reversed the frequency of choosing the two alternatives, which supports that the biased choice behavior was caused by biased sensory evidence. We also found consistent estimates of the sensory biases using a task with two asymmetric alternatives.

The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species.  However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant. These results demonstrate the importance of using appropriate null models when studying observational microbiome data, and suggest that extracting and characterizing three-way interactions among OTUs is a promising direction for unraveling the structure and function of microbial ecosystems.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE165.pdf,"[( 29 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 27 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 23 Aug 2016 , 6), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 6), ( 28 Aug 2016 , 5), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 2)]"

This process - adaptive introgression - may lead to a faster rate of adaptation than is predicted from models with mutation and selection alone. Within the last couple of years, a series of studies have identified regions of the genome that are likely examples of adaptive introgression. In many cases, once a region was ascertained as being introgressed, commonly used statistics based on both haplotype as well as allele frequency information were employed to test for positive selection. Introgression by itself, however, changes both the haplotype structure and the distribution of allele frequencies, thus confounding traditional tests for detecting positive selection. Therefore, patterns generated by introgression alone may lead to false inferences of positive selection. Here we explore models involving both introgression and positive selection to investigate the behavior of various statistics under adaptive introgression. In particular, we find that the number and allelic frequencies of sites that are uniquely shared between archaic humans and specific present-day populations are particularly useful for detecting adaptive introgression. We then examine the 1000 Genomes dataset to characterize the landscape of uniquely shared archaic alleles in human populations.

In contrast to the robust global transcriptome changes induced by DENV, ZIKV has a more selective and larger impact on expression of genes involved in DNA replication and repair. While overall expression profiles are similar, ZIKVC, but not ZIKVM, induces upregulation of viral response genes and TP53. P53 inhibitors can block the apoptosis induced by both ZIKVC and ZIKVM in hNPCs, with higher potency against ZIKVC-induced apoptosis. Our analyses reveal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures associated with ZIKV infection.

 It was not possible to detect the common problem of insincere grip effort in grip strength evaluation until now. The usually used JAMAR dynamometer has low sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between maximal and submaximal effort. The manugraphy system may give additional information to the dynamometer measurements used to assess grip force, as it also measures the load distribution of the hand while it grips a cylinder. Until now, the data of load distribution evaluation were analyzed by comparing discrete variables (e.g., load values of a defined area). From another point of view, the results of manugraphy measurements form a pattern. Analyzing patterns is a typical domain of machine learning.  
Methods
We used data from several studies that assessed load distribution with maximal and submaximal effort. They consisted of 2016 total observations, including 324 patterns of submaximal effort. The rest were from grips with maximal effort. After preparation and feature selection, XGBoost machine learning was used for classification of the patterns. 
Findings
After applying machine learning to the given data, we were able to predict submaximal grip effort based on the inherent pattern with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100%.
Interpretation
Using techniques from applied predictive modeling, submaximal effort in grip strength testing could be detected with high accuracy through load distribution analysis. Machine learning is a suitable method for recognizing altered grip patterns.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1970.pdf,"[( 23 Aug 2016 , 12), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 5)]"

How the rhythmic signaling pulse delivered by the Segmentation Clock is translated into the periodic morphogenesis of somites remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on the role of Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC/Pcdh8) in this process. We show that in chicken and mouse embryos, PAPC expression is tightly regulated by the Clock and Wavefront system in the posterior PSM. We observed that PAPC exhibits a striking complementary pattern to N-Cadherin (CDH2), marking the interface of the future somite boundary in the anterior PSM. Gain and loss of function of PAPC in chicken embryos disrupt somite segmentation by altering the CDH2-dependent epithelialization of PSM cells. Our data suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is increased in PAPC expressing cells, subsequently affecting CDH2 internalization in the anterior compartment of the future somite. This in turn generates a differential adhesion interface, allowing formation of the acellular fissure that defines the somite boundary. Thus periodic expression of PAPC downstream of the Segmentation Clock triggers rhythmic endocytosis of CDH2, allowing for segmental de-adhesion and individualization of somites.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Development/Development14.pdf,"[( 26 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 23 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 11), ( 15 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 5)]"

As a first step towards the comprehensive understanding of how environment shapes the physiology and the life cycle of a loggerhead turtle, we constructed a full life cycle model based on the principles of energy acquisition and utilization embedded in the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We adapted the standard DEB model using data from published and unpublished sources to obtain parameter estimates and model predictions that could be compared with data.

To measure the diversity of the founding population and to compute the probability of alternative transmission scenarios, while explicitly taking phylogenetic uncertainty into account, we created an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method based on a set of statistics measuring phylogenetic topology, branch lengths, and genetic diversity. We applied our method to a heterosexual transmission pair showing a complex paraphyletic-polyphyletic donor-recipient phylogenetic topology. We found evidence identifying the donor that was consistent with the known facts of the case (Bayes factor >20). We also found that while the evidence for ongoing transmission between the pair was as good or better than the singular transmission event model, it was only viable when the rate of ongoing transmission was implausibly high (~1/day). We concluded that the singular transmission model, which was able to estimate the diversity of the founding population (mean 7% substitutions/site), was more biologically plausible. Our study provides a formal inference framework to investigate HIV-1 direction, diversity, and frequency of transmission.

One of the proposed determinants of bacterial persistence is Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAS) which are also implicated in a wide range of stress-related phenomena. In a report (Maisonneuve E, Castro-Camargo M, Gerdes K. 2013. Cell 154:1140-1150) an interesting link between ppGpp mediated stringent response, TAS and persistence is proposed. It is proposed that accumulation of ppGpp enhances the accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate which modulates Lon protease to degrade antitoxins. The decrease in the concentration of antitoxins supposedly activated the toxin to increase in the number of persisters during antibiotic treatment. In this study, we show that inorganic polyphosphate is not required for Lon-dependent degradation of YefM, the antitoxin of YefM/YoeB TAS. The Δ10 strain, an Escherichia coli MG1655 derivative in which the ten TAS are deleted, is more sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Ampicillin compared to wild-type MG1655. Furthermore, we show that the Δ10 strain has relatively lower fitness compared to the wild type and hence, we argue that the implications based on this strain are void.

By altering levels of mutant or wild-type U2AF1 in this cell line and by analyzing published data on human lung adenocarcinomas, we show that S34F-associated changes in alternative splicing are proportional to the ratio of S34F:wild-type gene products and not to absolute levels of either the mutant or wild-type factor. Preferential recognition of specific 3' splice sites in S34F-expressing cells is largely explained by differential in vitro RNA-binding affinities of mutant versus wild-type U2AF1 for those same 3' splice sites.

In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman's R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur), and impact the evolutionary resilience (ie, the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in face of external disturbances.

In most cases, ancestry components are inferred correctly, although sample sizes and times since admixture can influence the inferences. Similarly, the popular Gaussian approximation tends to perform poorly when branch lengths are long, although the tree topology is correctly inferred in all scenarios explored.

Previously, as facilitated with our discovery in 2005 that completely insoluble proteins could be all solubilized in unsalted water [Song (2009) FEBS Lett. 583: 953], we found that the TDP-43 prion-like domain in fact contains an intrinsic membrane-interacting subdomain [Lim et al. [2016] PLoS Biol. 14, e1002338]. We decrypted that ALS-causing mutations/cofactor-depletion act to render the well-structured folds of cytosolic VAPB-MSP domain and SOD1 into highly disordered states, thus becoming buffer-insoluble. Most surprisingly, this also unlocks the amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions universally exiting in proteins, which thus acquire a novel capacity in abnormally interacting with membranes [Qin et al. (2013) F1000Res 2-221.v2; Lim (2016) BBA-Biomembranes. 1858: 2223]. Here we aimed extend our discovery to address two fundamental questions: 1) why many E. coli proteins become aggregated in aging; and 2) whether aggregation-prone proteins can also acquire a novel capacity in interacting with membranes; by dissecting the 557-residue S1 ribosomal protein into 7 fragments to disrupt its 6 S1 folds, followed by extensive CD and NMR characterizations. The results reveal that we have successfully eliminated all 6 S1 folds and fragment 4 becomes highly disordered and thus buffer-insoluble. Most strikingly, F4 does acquire a capacity in transforming into a helical conformation in membrane environments. Here, for the first time, our study deciphers that like ALS-causing mutants, the disruption of a well-folded E. coli cytosolic protein also unlocks its amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions which are capable of abnormally interacting with membranes. Therefore, proteins, the most important functional players for all forms of life, can transform into membrane-toxic forms triggering diseases and aging, if their hydrophobic/amphiphilic regions are unlocked by genetic, pathological or/and environmental factors, which is characteristic of severe aggregation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1976.pdf,"[( 23 Apr 2017 , 2), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 9)]"

Consistently, most secretory pathway components are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. At the same time, recent studies identified that the largest fraction of tissue-specific proteins consists of secreted and membrane proteins and not intracellular proteins. This suggests that the secretory pathway is distinctively regulated in a tissue-specific fashion. However, a systematic analysis on how the protein secretory pathway is tuned in different tissues is lacking, and it is even largely unexplored if the secretome and membrane proteome differs in, for example, post-translation modifications across tissues. Here, analyzing publically available transcriptome data across 30 human tissues, we discovered the expression level of key components previously categorized as housekeeping proteins were specifically over-expressed in a certain tissue compared with the average expression of their corresponding secretory pathway subsystem (e.g. protein folding). These extreme genes defines an exceptional fine-tuning in specific subnetworks, which neatly differentiated for example the pancreas and liver from 30 other tissues. Moreover, the subnetwork expression tuning correlated with the nature and number of post translational modification sites in the pancreas or liver-specific secretome and membrane proteome. These patterns were recurrently observed also in other tissues, like the blood, the brain and the skeletal muscle. These findings conciliate both the housekeeping and tissue-specific nature of the protein secretory pathway, which we attribute to a fine-tuned regulation of defined subnetworks in order to support the diversity of secreted proteins and their modifications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1977.pdf,"[( 26 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 7)]"

Furthermore, free heme induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 to reinforce the production of CO, biliverdin and bilirubin. As such, free heme can drive two antagonistic mechanisms to affect adaptive immunity. What is the outcome of animal immune response to an antigen in the presence of free heme? The question remains to be explored. Here we report the immunization results by intraperitoneal injection of the formulations containing BSA and heme. When the used heme concentrations were about less than 1μM, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was unaffected; when the used heme concentrations were about more than 1μM but less than 5μM, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was enhanced; when the used heme concentrations were about more than 5μM, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was suppressed. The results demonstrate that heme can modulate adaptive immunity (at least humoral immunity) by the mode of double concentration-thresholds. If heme concentrations are below the first threshold, there is no effect on adaptive immunity; if between the first and second thresholds, there is promotive effect; if over the second threshold, there is inhibitive effect.

However, outside the first year of life, the majority of affected patients, particularly in ancestrally mixed populations, do not have a known monogenic form of NS.  Even in those children classified with a monogenic form of NS, there is phenotypic heterogeneity. Thus, we have only discovered a fraction of the heritability of NS − the underlying genetic factors contributing to phenotypic variation. Part of the missing heritability for NS has been posited to be explained by patients harboring coding variants across one or more previously implicated NS genes, insufficient to cause NS in a classical Mendelian manner, but that nonetheless impact protein function enough to cause disease.  However, systematic evaluation in patients with NS for rare or low-frequency risk alleles within single genes, or in combination across genes (oligogenicity), has not been reported.  

Objective: To determine whether, as compared to a reference population, patients with NS have either a significantly increased burden of protein-altering variants (risk alleles), or unique combination of them (oligogenicity), in a set of 21 genes implicated in Mendelian forms of NS. 

Methods: In 303 patients with NS enrolled in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), we performed targeted amplification paired with next-generation sequencing of 21 genes implicated in monogenic NS. We created a high-quality variant call set and compared it to a variant call set of the same genes in a reference population composed of 2535 individuals from Phase 3 of 1000 Genomes Project. We created both a 'stringent' and 'relaxed' pathogenicity filtering pipeline, applied them to both cohorts, and computed the (1) burden of variants in the entire gene set per cohort, (2) burden of variants in the entire gene set per individual, (3) burden of variants within a single gene per cohort, and (4) unique combinations of variants across two or more genes per cohort. 

Results: With few exceptions when using the relaxed filter, and which are likely the result of confounding by population stratification, NS patients did not have significantly increased burden of variants in Mendelian NS genes in comparison to a reference cohort, nor was there any evidence of oligogenicity. This was true when using both the relaxed and stringent variant pathogenicity filter.  

Conclusion: In our study, the burden or particular combinations of low-frequency or rare protein altering variants in previously implicated Mendelian NS genes cohort does not significantly differ between North American patients with NS and a reference population.  Studies in larger independent cohorts or meta−analyses are needed to assess generalizability of our discoveries and also address whether there is in fact small but significant enrichment of risk alleles or oligogenicity in NS cases undetectable with this current sample size.  It is still possible that rare protein altering variants in these genes, insufficient to cause Mendelian disease, still contribute to NS as risk alleles and/or via oligogenicity.  However, we suggest that more accurate bioinformatic analyses and the incorporation of functional assays would be necessary to identify bona fide instances of this form of genetic architecture as a contributor to the heritability of NS.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pediatric Nephrology/Pediatric Nephrology1.pdf,"[( 26 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 5)]"

Static robustness, e.g., homeostasis, is the insensitivity of a state against perturbations, whereas dynamics robustness, e.g., homeorhesis, is the insensitivity of a dynamic process. In contrast to the extensively studied static robustness, dynamics robustness, i.e., how a system creates an invariant temporal profile against perturbations, is little explored despite  transient dynamics being crucial for cellular fates and are reported to be robust experimentally. For example, the duration of a stimulus elicits different phenotypic responses, and signaling networks process and encode temporal information. Hence, robustness in time courses will be necessary for functional biochemical networks. Based on dynamical systems theory, we uncovered a general mechanism to achieve dynamics robustness. Using a three-stage linear signaling cascade as an example, we found that the temporal profiles and response duration post-stimulus is robust to perturbations against certain parameters. Then analyzing the linearized model, we elucidated the criteria of how such dynamics robustness emerges in signaling networks. We found that changes in the upstream modules are masked in the cascade, and that the response duration is mainly controlled by the rate-limiting module and organization of the cascade's kinetics. Specifically, we found two necessary conditions for dynamics robustness in signaling cascades: 1) Constraint on the rate-limiting process: The phosphatase activity in the perturbed module is not the slowest. 2) Constraints on the initial conditions: The kinase activity needs to be fast enough such that each module is saturated even with fast phosphatase activity and upstream information is attenuated. We discussed the relevance of such robustness to several biological examples and the validity of the above conditions therein.

The 2014-5 West African Ebola epidemic highlights the need for rigorous, rapid clinical trials under difficult circumstances. Challenges include temporally and spatially patchy transmission, and the responsibility to deliver public health interventions during a randomized trial. An innovative design such as ring vaccination with an immediate arm and a delayed arm can address these issues, but complex trials raise complex analysis issues. 
Methods and Findings
We present a stochastic, compartmental model for a ring vaccination trial of a vaccine for an Ebola-like disease. After identification of an index case, a ring of primary contacts is recruited and either vaccinated immediately or after a delay of 21 days. The primary outcome of the trial is effectiveness calculated from cumulative incidence in the two arms, counting cases only from a pre-specified window in which the immediate arm is assumed to be fully protected and the delayed arm is not protected. The results of simulating the trial are used to calculate the sample size necessary for 80% power and the estimates of effectiveness are reported under a variety of assumptions regarding the trial design and implementation.
The three key components of sample size calculations -- attack rate in controls, estimate of incidence difference between the arms, and intracluster correlation coefficient -- are dependent on trial design and implementation in a way that can be quantitatively predicted by the model. Under baseline parameter assumptions, we found that a total of 8,900 study participants were needed to achieve 80% power to detect a difference in attack rate between the two arms, whereas a standard approach with the same parameters returns a necessary sample size of 7,100 individuals. Such a study would on average return a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 69.81%, with average 95% confidence interval (41.2%, 84.2%).
We found that for this design the necessary sample size and estimated effectiveness are sensitive to properties of the vaccine -- in particular, pre-exposure and post-exposure efficacy; to two setting-specific parameters over which investigators have little control -- rate of infections from outside the ring and overall attack rate in the controls; and to three parameters that are determined by the study design -- the time window in which cases are counted, intensity of case-detection and administrative delay in vaccinating individuals.
This approach replaces assumptions about parameters in the trial  with assumptions about disease dynamics and vaccine characteristics at the individual level.
Conclusions
Incorporating simulation into the trial design process can improve robustness of sample size calculations. Simulation can identify optimal values for study design parameters that can be controlled. For this specific trial design, vaccine effectiveness depends on properties of the ring vaccination design and on the measurement window, as well as the epidemiologic setting. Rejecting the null likely indicates one or more types of vaccine efficacy at the individual level, but the magnitude of the effect will vary across settings.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases16.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 26 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 29 Aug 2016 , 10), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1)]"
"August 25, 2016",Ending AIDS: Progress and prospects for the control of HIV and TB in South Africa,Pre print,"[(Williams, Brian Gerard,  WRHI and SACEMA), (Gupta, Somya,  International Association of Providers of AIDS Care (IAPAC)), (Wollmers, Matthew,  International Association of Providers of AIDS Care (IAPAC)), (Granich, Reuben,  International Association of Providers of AIDS Care (IAPAC))]",https://doi.org/10.1101/061929 ,"We assess the prospects for ending AIDS in South Africa using a dynamical model to fit data on time trends in HIV prevalence and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) coverage for adults. We estimate current and project future trends in HIV incidence, prevalence and AIDS related deaths, in ART coverage and incidence, and in TB notification rates. We consider two scenarios: constant effort under which people continue to be started on treatment at the current rate and expanded treatment and prevention under which testing rates are increased, everyone is started on treatment as soon as they are found to be infected with HIV, and voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom distribution programmes are expanded. 
	As a result of the roll-out of ART the incidence of HIV has fallen from a peak of 2.3% per annum in 1996 to 0.65% in 2016, the AIDS related mortality from a peak of 1.4% per annum in 2006 to 0.37% p.a. in 2016 and both continue to fall at a relative rate of 17% p.a. Maintaining a policy of constant effort will lead to further declines in HIV incidence, AIDS related mortality and TB notification rates but will not end AIDS. Implementing a policy of expanded treatment and prevention in September 2016 should ensure that by 2020 new infections and deaths will be less than one per thousand adults and the UNAIDS Goal of Ending AIDS by 2030 will be reached. Scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom availability will avert some new infections but will save relatively few lives. Nevertheless, equity demands that people at very high risk of infection including commercial sex-workers, men-who-have-sex-with-men and young women should have access to the best available methods of prevention. 
	The current cost to the health services of managing HIV and TB among adults in South Africa is about US$2.1 Bn p.a. (0.6% of GDP p.a.) and this will rise to a peak of US$2.7 Bn p.a. in 2018 (0.8% GDP p.a.). As treatment is scaled up and prevention made available to those at high risk, the cost will fall to US$ 1.8 Bn p.a. in 2030 and US$ 1.0 Bn p.a. in 2050 as those that are living with HIV on ART, die of natural causes. The cost of testing people for HIV is never more than about 8% of the total cost and since testing is the sine qua non of treatment it will be essential to invest sufficient resources in testing. The cost of treating tuberculosis is never more than about 10% of the total and since this is the major cause of AIDS related illness and deaths, efforts should be made to optimise TB treatment.
	Ending AIDS in the world will depend critically on what happens in South Africa which accounts for 20% of all people living with HIV. The increasing availability of ART has had a major impact on both HIV incidence and AIDS related mortality and universal access to ART is affordable. With the commitment to make treatment available to all those infected with HIV in September 2016, the South African government is well placed to eliminate HIV as a major threat to public health by 2020 and to end AIDS by 2030. Individuals at high risk of infection deserve access to the best available methods of protecting themselves and they will become increasingly important in the final stages of ending the epidemic.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1984.pdf,"[( 26 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 3)]"

Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this paper, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies, and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science.

These processes, both potentially leading to protein production, were described only in viral systems, and although putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was shown to be present, and RdRs to occur, in most, if not all, mammalian cells, its function was presumed to be restricted to regulatory. Here we report the occurrence of protein-encoding RNA to RNA information transfer in mammalian cells. We describe below the detection, by next generation sequencing (NGS), of a chimeric double-stranded/pinhead intermediate containing both sense and antisense globin RNA strands covalently joined in a predicted and uniquely defined manner, whose cleavage at the pinhead would result in the generation of an end-product containing the intact coding region of the original mRNA. We also describe the identification of the putative end product of RNA-dependent globin mRNA amplification. It is heavily modified, uniformly truncated at both untranslated regions (UTRs), terminates with the OH group at the 5-prime end, consistent with a cleavage-generated 5-prime terminus, and its massive cellular amount is unprecedented for a conventional mRNA transcription product. It also translates in a cell-free system into polypeptides indistinguishable from the translation product of conventional globin mRNA. The physiological significance of the mammalian mRNA amplification, which might operate during terminal differentiation and in the production of highly abundant rapidly generated proteins such as some collagens or other components of extracellular matrix, with every genome-originated mRNA molecule acting as a potential template, as well as possible implications, including physiologically occurring intracellular PCR process, iPCR, are discussed in the paper.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1985.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 7)]"

To investigate the role of bacterial and host factors in contributing to S. aureus bacteraemia-associated mortality we sequenced a collection of clinical isolates (of the MLST clonal complex CC22) from patients with bloodstream infections and quantified specific virulence phenotypes. A genome-wide association scan identified several novel virulence-affecting loci, which we validated using a functional genomics approach. Analysing the data comprising bacterial genotype and phenotype as well as clinical meta-data within a machine-learning framework revealed that mortality associated with CC22 bacteraemia is not only influenced by the interactions between host and bacterial factors but can also be predicted at the individual patient-level to a high degree of accuracy. This study clearly demonstrates the potential of using a combined genomics and data analytic approach to enhance our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis. Considering both host and microbial factors, including whole genome sequence and phenotype data, within a predictive framework could thus pave the way towards personalised medicine and infectious disease management.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1989.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 27 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 26 Aug 2016 , 8)]"

Genome-wide profiling of gene expression (RNA-Seq) and fitness (Tn-Seq) allows two views of the same genetic network underlying these responses. However, it remains unclear how they combine, enabling a bacterium to overcome a perturbation.

Results: Here we generate RNA-Seq and Tn-Seq profiles in three strains of S. pneumoniae in response to stress defined by different levels of nutrient depletion. These profiles show that genes that change their expression and/or become phenotypically important come from a diverse set of functional categories, and genes that are phenotypically important tend to be highly expressed. Surprisingly, we find that expression and fitness changes rarely occur on the same gene, which we confirmed by over 140 validation experiments. To rationalize these unexpected results we built the first genome-scale metabolic model of S. pneumoniae showing that differential expression and phenotypic importance actually correlate between nearest neighbors, although they are distinctly partitioned into small subnetworks. Moreover, a meta-analysis of 234 S. pneumoniae gene expression studies reveals that essential genes and phenotypically important subnetworks rarely change expression, indicating that they are shielded from transcriptional fluctuations and that a clear distinction exists between transcriptional and phenotypic response networks.

Conclusions: We present a genome-wide computational/experimental approach that contextualizes changes that occur on transcriptomic and phenomic levels in response to stress.  Importantly, this highlights the need to connect disparate response networks, for instance in antibiotic target identification, where preferred targets are phenotypically important genes that would be overlooked by transcriptomic analyses alone.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1990.pdf,"[( 27 Aug 2016 , 5), ( 21 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 02 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 29 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 26 Aug 2016 , 6)]"

We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads and also applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10^-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved.

To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent) DNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states -- active (binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any DNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its affinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor). Due to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into clusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange with the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching experiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by ""equilibrium"", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state; when these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow indefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of chromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of highly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of nuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts to give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as switching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biophysical Journal/Biophysical Journal15.pdf,"[( 27 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jul 2016 , 5)]"

Surprisingly, mating, but not nuptial gift consumption, affected bacterial community structure, and only in Mormon crickets. The change in structure was due to a precipitous drop in the abundance of lactic-acid bacteria in unmated females, a taxon known for their beneficial effects on nutrition and immunity.

Yet such modeling is needed to formalize verbal arguments and deepen our understanding of brain evolution. To address this issue, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brain's energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. Our model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated to the growth of brain and other tissues at each age under various biological settings as a result of natural selection. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a ``me-against-nature'' setting, namely when overcoming environmentally determined energy-extraction challenges does not involve any interactions with other individuals (possibly except caregivers), and using parameter values for modern humans. The uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny, as well as for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that (1) a me-against-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale, (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory, and (3) adult skill number is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills.

Seeking an amplifying feedback loop, I analyzed the lightning-brush-fire ecology for grazing animals in a grassy burn scar.  Discovering the new grass by exploring brush byways could promote a population boom−but only after grass-specialized herbivores evolved from mixed feeders at 2.4 myr.  When the brush returned several decades later, the grazer boom would turn to bust, squeezing numerous descendants back into the core grasslands.  Meat-eating Homo species would boom and bust when grazers did, enriching the core in whatever alleles were earlier concentrated in the brush fringe catchment zone for that boom.  This return migration for Homo is what creates the amplifying feedback loop that speeds brain enlargement rate, likely up to the mutation rate limit.  It also promotes trait hitchhiking: any brush-relevant allele, not just those for hunting, can experience amplifying feedback merely by hanging out in the catchment zone.  The shade offered by brush would have been the default location for cooperative nurseries, time-consuming food preparation, and toolmaking.  Increased behavioral versatility correlates with larger brain size.  The more versatile brains of a current generation need only spend more-than-average time in the boom's catchment zone for this recursive evolutionary process to keep average brain size increasing via assortative mating.  This can account for the time when linear enlargement began, when it ended, and why it slowed in Neanderthals and in Asian Homo erectus.  Without utilizing Darwin's selective survival, the feedback loop makes advance room for ""free"" future functionality in the cerebral cortex, likely relevant to the evolutionary emergence of our structured intellectual functions  such as syntax, contingent planning, games, and logic.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1996.pdf,"[( 19 May 2016 , 3)]"

The impact of peroxisome deficiency on mitochondria is not elucidated yet. Here we present a model of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4)-induced lipotoxicity and accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) as the cause for mitochondrial damage in consequence of peroxisome loss in a Peroxin19 (pex19) mutant. Hyperactive Hnf4 signaling leads to upregulation of lipase 3 and enzymes for mitochondrial β-oxidation. This results in enhanced lipolysis, elevated concentrations of NEFA, maximal β-oxidation and mitochondrial swelling. NEFA are ligands for Hnf4 and further enhance its activity.

In this sense, we determined the main infection aspects of the Brazilian Zika strain in reference Aedes aegypti laboratory mosquitoes.
We orally exposed Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville mosquitoes to a Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) and qRT-PCR was applied to determine the infection and dissemination rates, and viral levels in mosquito tissues as well as in the saliva. The ZIKVBR kinetics was monitored during the infection in Rockefeller mosquitoes.

Although variations in the saliva detection rates were observed, we confirmed that ZIKVBR was present in saliva from Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville females at detectable levels at 14 days post-infection. The ZIKVBR kinetics in Rockefeller mosquitoes showed that the virus could be detected in the heads at 4 days post-infection but was more consistently detected late in infection. The viral levels peaked at 11 days post-infection in the mosquito bodies, remaining stable until 14 days post-infection, in contrast to the heads, where the mean viral levels only peaked at 14 days post-infection.Our study presents the first evaluation on how Brazilian Zika virus behaves in reference Aedes aegypti strains and shed light on how the infection evolves over time.

GWAS risk loci alter the individual's disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue may play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWAS and eQTL studies is challenging due to the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present a new method, eCAVIAR, that is capable of accounting for LD while computing the quantity we refer to as the colocalization posterior probability (CLPP). The CLPP is the  probability that the same variant is responsible for both the GWAS and eQTL signal. eCAVIAR has several key advantages. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any loci. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Utilizing  publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that computing CLPP can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of Glucose and Insulin-related traits loci.  eCAVIAR is available at

The proposed method performed markedly better than simpler alternatives, better with multi-site than single-site data, and resulted in a considerably higher cross-validated correlation score than has previously been reported in the literature for multi-site data.

IPMs track the distribution of phenotype in populations through time, using functions describing phenotype-dependent development, inheritance, survival and fecundity. For evolutionary inference, two important features of any model are the ability to (i) characterize relationships among traits (including values of the same traits across ages) within individuals, and (ii) characterize similarity between individuals and their descendants. In IPM analyses, the former depends on regressions of observed trait values at each age on values at the previous age (development functions), and the latter on regressions of offspring values at birth on parent values as adults (inheritance functions). We show analytically that development functions, characterized this way, will typically underestimate covariances of trait values across ages, due to compounding of regression to the mean across projection steps. Similarly, we show that inheritance, characterized this way, is inconsistent with a modern understanding of inheritance, and underestimates the degree to which relatives are phenotypically similar. Additionally, we show that the use of a constant biometric inheritance function, particularly with a constant intercept, is incompatible with evolution. Consequently, current implementations of IPMs will predict little or no phenotypic evolution, purely as artifacts of their construction. We present alternative approaches to constructing development and inheritance functions, based on a quantitative genetic approach, and show analytically and through an empirical example on a population of bighorn sheep how they can potentially recover patterns that are critical to evolutionary inference.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Evolutionary Biology/Journal of Evolutionary Biology11.pdf,"[( 20 Jul 2016 , 6)]"

However, this strategy is limited to identifying sites in NP where mutations that affect MxA sensitivity have fixed during the small number of documented zoonotic transmissions of influenza to humans. Here we use an unbiased deep mutational scanning approach to quantify how all ≈10,000 amino-acid mutations to NP affect MxA sensitivity. We both identify new sites in NP where mutations affect MxA resistance and re-identify mutations known to have increased MxA resistance during historical adaptations of influenza to humans. Most of the sites where mutations have the greatest effect are almost completely conserved across all influenza A viruses, and the amino acids at these sites confer relatively high resistance to MxA. These sites cluster in regions of NP that appear to be important for its recognition by MxA.

Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, predicting the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation.

Unlike external stimuli these other sources of input are challenging to experimentally control or even observe, and as a result contribute to variability of neuronal responses to sensory stimuli. However, such sources of input are likely not “noise”, and likely play an integral role in sensory cortex function. Here, we introduce the rectified latent variable model (RLVM) in order to identify these sources of input using simultaneously recorded cortical neuron populations. The RLVM is novel in that it employs non-negative (rectified) latent variables, and is able to be much less restrictive in the mathematical constraints on solutions due to the use an autoencoder neural network to initialize model parameters. We show the RLVM outperforms principal component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis across a variety of measures using simulated data.

In both humans and songbirds, vocal skills are acquired by a process of imitation whereby current vocal production is compared to an acoustic target. Similarly, performance in adulthood relies strongly on auditory feedback, and online manipulations of auditory signals can dramatically alter acoustic production even after vocalizations have been well learned. Artificially delaying auditory feedback can disrupt both speech and birdsong, and internal delays in auditory feedback have been hypothesized as a cause of vocal dysfluency in persons who stutter. Furthermore, in both song and speech online shifts of the pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback lead to compensatory changes in vocal pitch for small perturbations, but larger pitch shifts produce smaller changes in vocal output. Intriguingly, large pitch shifts can partially restore normal speech in some dysfluent speakers, suggesting that the effects of auditory feedback delays might be ameliorated by online pitch manipulations. While birdsong provides a promising model system for understanding speech production, the interaction between sensory feedback delays and pitch shifts have not yet been assessed in songbirds. To investigate this, we asked whether the addition of a pitch shift modulates delay-induced changes in Bengalese finch song, hypothesizing that pitch shifts would reduce the effects of feedback delays. Compared the effects of delays alone, combined delays and pitch shifts resulted in a significant reduction in behavioral changes in one type of sequencing (branch points) but not another (distribution of repeated syllables).",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eNeuro/eNeuro4.pdf,"[( 29 Aug 2016 , 5)]"

As species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the structure of these networks changes; this happens because species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of ecological interactions share common evolutionary mechanisms that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death processes for species interactions describes the structure of extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types of ecological interactions we considered--seed dispersal, herbivory, parasitism, bacteriophagy, and pollination--only differed in the position they occupy in the parameters' multi-dimensional space.

An initial 2 h exposure to 5 mM caffeine slowed a fraction of the cells in G1, but thereafter, continued caffeine exposure permitted this cell fraction to progress through the cycle until they eventually stalled at G2/M and underwent apoptosis.  This prolonged caffeine exposure also induced a strong DDR along with subsequent activation of wild-type p53 protein.  An unexpected observation was the caffeine-induced depletion of Rad51 (and Brca2) proteins. Consequently, caffeine-treated cells were expected to be inefficient in HR. However, a dichotomy in the HR response of cells to caffeine treatment was revealed. Caffeine treatment rendered cells significantly better at performing the nascent DNA synthesis that accompanies the early strand invasion steps of HR.  Conversely, the increase in nascent DNA synthesis did not translate into a higher level of gene targeting events. Levels of Rad51 appear to be irrelevant. Thus, prolonged caffeine exposure stalls the cell cycle, induces a p53-mediated apoptotic response and a down-regulation of critical HR proteins, and stimulates early steps of HR, but not the formation of complete repair products.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2005.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 29 Aug 2016 , 5)]"

In studies with 10 cultivars grown over a 3-yr period, we found that seeds produced at the top of the canopy have higher concentrations of protein but less oil and lower concentrations of minerals such as Mg, Fe, and Cu compared to seeds produced at the bottom of the canopy.  Among cultivars, mean protein concentration (average of different positions) correlated positively with mean concentrations of S, Zn and Fe, but not other minerals. Therefore, on a whole plant basis, the uptake and allocation of S, Zn and Fe to seeds correlated with the production and allocation of reduced N to seed protein; however, the reduced N and correlated minerals (S, Zn and Fe) showed different patterns of allocation among node positions.  For example, while mean concentrations of protein and Fe correlated positively, the two parameters correlated negatively in terms of variation with canopy position.  Altering the microenvironment within the soybean canopy by removing neighboring plants at flowering increased protein concentration in particular at lower node positions and thus altered the node-position gradient in protein (and oil) without altering the distribution of Mg, Fe and Cu, suggesting different underlying control mechanisms. Metabolomic analysis of developing seeds at different positions in the canopy suggests that availability of free asparagine may be a positive determinant of storage protein accumulation in seeds and may explain the increased protein accumulation in seeds produced at the top of the canopy. Our results establish node-position variation in seed constituents and provide a new experimental system to identify genes controlling key aspects of seed composition. In addition, our results provide an unexpected and simple approach to link agronomic practices to improve human nutrition and health in developing countries because food products produced from seeds at the bottom of the canopy contained higher Fe concentrations than products from the top of the canopy.

Hidden orthologs do not show unusual sequence composition biases (e.g. GC content, average length, domain composition) that might account for systematic errors in sequence similarity searches. Instead, gene duplication and divergence of one paralog and weak positive selection appear to underlie hidden orthology in Platyhelminthes.

We evolved this model in a fluctuating environment under different selection pressures, mutation step-sizes, population sizes, and fluctuation frequencies. There was a trade-off between minimizing the adaptation time after each environmental transition and increasing the robustness of the phenotype during the constant environment between transitions.

These chemically defended anurans use bright aposematic colors to warn potential predators of their unpalatibility. However, aposematic signals are frequency-dependent and individuals deviating from a local model are at a higher risk of predation. The well-known examples of Batesian and Mullerian mimics, hymenopterans (wasps and bees) and Heliconius butterflies, both support the benefits of unique models with relatively high frequencies. However, extreme diversity in the aposematic signal has been documented in the poison frogs of the genus Dendrobates, especially in the Oophaga subgenus. Here we investigate the phylogenetic and genomic differentiations among populations of Oophaga sylvatica, which exhibit one of the highest phenotypic diversification among poison frogs. Using a combination of PCR amplicons (mitochondrial and nuclear markers) and genome wide markers from a double-digested RAD data set, we characterize 13 populations (12 monotypic and 1 polytypic) across the O. sylvatica distribution. These populations are mostly separated in two lineages distributed in the Northern and the Southern part of their range in Ecuador. We found relatively low genetic differentiation within each lineage, despite considerable phenotypic variation, and evidence suggesting ongoing gene flow and genetic admixture among some populations of the Northern lineage. Overall these data suggest that phenotypic diversification and novelty in aposematic coloration can arise in secondary contact zones even in systems where phenotypes are subject to strong stabilizing selection.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2010.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2016 , 12), ( 31 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

Statistically-fitted dispersal kernels allow observations of a limited number of dispersal events to be extrapolated across a wider landscape, and form the basis of a wide range of theories and methods in ecology, evolution and conservation. Genetic parentage data are an increasingly common source of dispersal information, particularly for species where dispersal is difficult to observe directly. It is now routinely applied to coral reef fish, whose larvae disperse over many kilometers and are too small to follow directly. However, it is not straightforward to estimate dispersal kernels from parentage data, and existing methods each have substantial limitations. Here we develop and proof a new statistical estimator for fitting dispersal kernels to parentage data, applying it to simulated and empirical datasets of reef fish parentage. The method incorporates a series of factors omitted in previous methods: the partial sampling of adults and juveniles on sampled reefs; the existence of unassigned dispersers from unsampled reefs; and post-settlement processes (e.g., density dependent mortality) that follow dispersal but precede parentage sampling. Power analyses indicate that the highest levels of sampling currently used for reef fishes is sufficient to fit accurate dispersal kernels. Sampling is best distributed equally between adults and juveniles, and over more than ten populations. Importantly, we show that accounting for unsampled or unassigned individuals - including adult individuals on partially-sampled and unsampled patches - is essential for a precise and unbiased estimate of dispersal.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Methods in Ecology and Evolution/Methods in Ecology and Evolution6.pdf,"[( 18 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

A remarkable early
finding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on
reaction times; i.e., the fact that the time period between a warning signal
and an impendent stimuli, to which subjects are instructed to respond as
quickly as possible, influences reaction times. Recently it has been shown that
the phase of oscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to
behavior. 
%
Here we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect
on the inter-trial phase coherence triggered by a stimulus to which subjects do
not respond.
%
Until now, inter-trial phase coherence has been used to describe a regularity
in the phases of groups of trials. We propose a single-trial measure of
inter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. 
%
Equipped with this measure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we
demonstrate that the foreperiod duration modulates single-trial phase
coherence.
%
In principle, this modulation could be an artifact due to the decoding method
used to detect it. We show that this is not the case, since the modulation
can also be observed with a very simple averaging method.

Although real, the single-trial modulation of inter-trial phase coherence by the foreperiod
duration could just reflect a nuisance in our data. We argue against this
possibility by showing that the strength of the modulation correlates with
subjects' behavioral measures, both error rates and mean-reaction times.

We anticipate that the new foreperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and
the decoding method used here to detect it, will be important tools to
understand cognition at the single-trial level. In Part II of this manuscript,

Recent methodological developments have led to models explicitly accounting for the interplay between mutation and selection, by explicitly modelling the amino acid fitness landscape along the sequence. However, thus far, most of these models have assumed that the fitness landscape is constant over time. Fluctuations of the fitness landscape may often be random or depend on complex and unknown factors. However, some organisms may be subject to systematic changes in selective pressure, resulting in reproducible molecular adaptations across independent lineages subject to similar conditions.  Results: Here, we developed a codon-based differential selection model, which aims to detect and quantify the fine-grained consistent patterns of adaptation at the protein-coding level, as a function of external conditions experienced by the organism under investigation. The model parameterizes the global mutational pressure, as well as the site- and condition-specific amino acid selective preferences. This phylogenetic model is implemented in a Bayesian MCMC framework. After validation with simulations, we applied our method to a dataset of HIV sequences from patients with known HLA genetic background. Our differential selection model detects and characterizes differentially selected coding positions specifically associated with two different HLA alleles.  Conclusion: our differential selection model is able to identify consistent molecular adaptations as a function of repeated changes in the environment of the organism.

Whereas this implies the involvement of recognition memory, the neural processes for reference resolution are largely unknown. Here, we report time-frequency analysis of four EEG experiments to reveal the increased coupling of functional neural systems associated with referentially coherent expressions compared to referentially ambiguous expressions.

We show with a set of experimental case studies that this theory explains disparate quantitative results from classical and modern experimental and computational studies on heteroplasmy variance in different species. We demonstrate that our general model provides a host of specific insights, including a modification of the often-used but hard-to-interpret Wright formula to correspond directly to biological observables, the ability to quantify selective and mutational pressure in mtDNA populations, and the pronounced variability inevitably arising from the action of possible mtDNA quality-control mechanisms.

The success of the WSME model in explaining the folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is dominated by native interactions, which makes the  energy landscape globally biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models, Saitô emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in protein folding; folding starts with the creation of  contiguous segments having a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these segments. The φ-values calculated  for barnase with the WSME model suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having  a complex topology, which opened the way to  comprehensively understanding the folding process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe allosteric transitions,  indicating that the allosteric structural movement does not occur as a  deterministic sequential change between two conformations but  as a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape.

De novo created proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not cause aggregation. Therefore, although the creation of the short ORFs could be truly random, but the fixation should be of subject to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on de novo created
proteins have been elusive and contradictory results have been reported. In Drosophila they are more disordered, i.e. are enriched in polar residues, than ancient proteins, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed.


To solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of all proteins in 187 eukaryotic species. We find that, on average, there are small differences between proteins of different ages, with the exception that younger proteins are shorter. However, when we take the GC content into account we find that this can explain the opposite trends observed in yeast (low GC) and drosophila (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder-promoting amino acids, and inversely correlated with transmembrane, helix and sheet promoting residues. We find that for the youngest proteins, i.e. the ones that are most likely to be de novo created, there exists a strong correlation with GC and structural properties. In contrast, this strong relationship is not seen for ancient proteins. This leads us to propose that structural features are not a strong determining
factor for fixation of de novo created genes. Instead these proteins resemble random proteins given a particular GC level.

This situation is unstable if the mother's mtDNA experiences a proliferative advantage over the third-party mtDNA, in which case the efficacy of the therapy may be undermined. Animal models suggest that the likelihood of such a proliferative advantage increases with increasing genetic distance between mother and third-party mtDNA, but in real therapeutic contexts the genetic distance, and so the importance of this effect, remains unclear. Here we harness a large volume of available human mtDNA data to model random sampling of mother and third-party mtDNAs from real human populations.

Randomly pairing mothers and third-party women in clinical contexts thus runs the risk that substantial mtDNA segregation will compromise the beneficial effects of the therapy.

This is especially true for prokaryotic PTM systems, many of which have only recently been recognized and studied in depth.  It is increasingly apparent that a deep sampling of abundance across a wide range of environmental stresses, growth conditions, and PTM types, rather than simply cataloging targets for a handful of modifications, is critical to understanding the complex pathways that govern PTM deposition and downstream effects. 

Results: We utilized a deeply-sampled dataset of MS/MS proteomic analysis covering 9 timepoints spanning the Escherichia coli growth cycle and an unbiased PTM search strategy to construct a temporal map of abundance for all PTMs within a 400 Da window of mass shifts. Using this map, we are able to identify novel targets and temporal patterns for N-terminal Nα acetylation, C-terminal glutamylation, and asparagine deamidation.  Furthermore, we identify a possible relationship between N-terminal Nα acetylation and regulation of protein degradation in stationary phase, pointing to a previously unrecognized biological function for this poorly-understood PTM.

Conclusions: Unbiased detection of PTM in MS/MS proteomics data facilitates the discovery of novel modification types and previously unobserved dynamic changes in modification across growth timepoints.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics54.pdf,"[( 03 May 2016 , 2), ( 02 May 2016 , 2), ( 01 May 2016 , 34), ( 09 May 2016 , 1)]"

We derived eight measures of central visual pathway anatomy from a structural image of the brain from 59 sighted and 53 blind people. These measures showed highly significant differences in mean size between the sighted and blind cohorts. When we examined the measurements across individuals within each group we found three clusters of correlated variation, with V1 surface area and pericalcarine volume linked, and independent of the thickness of V1 cortex. These two clusters were in turn relatively independent of the volumes of the optic chiasm and lateral geniculate nucleus. This same pattern of variation in visual pathway anatomy was found in the sighted and the blind. Anatomical changes within these clusters were graded by the timing of onset of blindness, with those subjects with a post-natal onset of blindness having alterations in brain anatomy that were intermediate to those seen in the sighted and congenitally blind. Many of the blind and sighted subjects also contributed functional MRI measures of cross-modal responses within visual cortex, and a diffusion tensor imaging measure of fractional anisotropy within the optic radiations and the splenium of the corpus callosum. We again found group differences between the blind and sighted in these measures. The previously identified clusters of anatomical variation were also found to be differentially related to these additional measures: across subjects, V1 cortical thickness was related to cross-modal activation, and the volume of the optic chiasm and lateral geniculate was related to fractional anisotropy in the visual pathway.

Because the PhILR transform relies on bacterial phylogenies, statistics applied in the PhILR coordinate system are also framed within an evolutionary perspective. Regression on PhILR transformed human microbiota data identified evolutionarily neighboring bacterial clades that may have differentiated to adapt to distinct body sites.

All the members of this family bind to the conserved GGA(A/T) core ETS binding sequence (EBS). Several ETS family members exhibit autoinhibition, wherein one domain of ETS blocks its own DNA-binding activity until certain conditions are met. Relief of autoinhibition in these proteins is coupled to homo- or hetero-dimer formation. Relief of autoinhibition in full-length ETS1 is catalyzed by non-specific interaction with DNA, which facilitates the formation of protein dimers.  The ETS1 splice variant, ETS1-p42, lacks an exon that encodes a crucial part of the autoinhibitory module. Thus, ETS1-p42 does not autoinhibit. We showed that the absence of autoinhibition allows ETS1Δ335, an N-terminal deletion that recapitulates the DNA- binding of ETS1-p42, to form homodimers in the absence of DNA. However, ETS1-p42 is thought to bind its DNA sites only as monomers. Here, we explore this paradox and show that ETS1Δ335 binds cooperatively to DNA containing two EBSs. We also show that residues in ETS1DNA recognition helix mediate this DNA-binding cooperativity. Furthermore we also find that a single EBS can bind two ETS1Δ335 subunits. Finally, we show that DNA acts catalytically to separate unbound ETS1Δ335 dimers into monomers. Together, these results suggest a model of ETS1-p42 DNA-binding, where ETS1-p42 can bind to a single EBS with 2:1 stoichiometry.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2019.pdf,"[( 31 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 01 Sep 2016 , 2)]"

To rectify this, we developed methods for obtaining high quality genome sequences directly from field samples without the need for sequence-based enrichment strategies prior to sequencing. We applied this to the first characterization of MDV-1 genomes from the field, without prior culture. These viruses were collected from vaccinated hosts that acquired naturally circulating field strains of MDV-1, in the absence of a disease outbreak. This reflects the current issue afflicting the poultry industry, where virulent field strains continue to circulate despite vaccination, and can remain undetected due to the lack of overt disease symptoms. We found that viral genomes from adjacent field sites had high levels of overall DNA identity, and despite strong evidence of purifying selection, had coding variations in proteins associated with virulence and manipulation of host immunity. Our methods empower ecological field surveillance, make it possible to determine the basis of viral virulence and vaccine breaks, and can be used to obtain full genomes from clinical samples of other large DNA viruses, known and unknown.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/mSphere/mSphere1.pdf,"[( 02 Sep 2016 , 3), ( 12 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 17 Jun 2016 , 2)]"

We present a reference-free method for this task that relies on a k-mer representation of genomes and a machine learning algorithm that produces intelligible models. The method is computationally scalable and well-suited for whole genome sequencing studies. 

Results: The method was validated by generating models that predict the antibiotic resistance of C. difficile, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae for 17 antibiotics. The obtained models are accurate, faithful to the biological pathways targeted by the antibiotics, and they provide insight into the process of resistance acquisition. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of the method revealed tight statistical guarantees on the accuracy of the obtained models, supporting its relevance for genomic biomarker discovery.

Conclusions: Our method allows the generation of accurate and interpretable predictive models of phenotypes, which rely on a small set of genomic variations.

Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current protocols to directly sequence the TCR require the use of long sequencing reads, increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed.

We applied TRAPeS to single cell RNA-seq of CD8+ T cells specific for a single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus. We show that the recently-described ""naive-like"" memory population of YFV-specific CD8+ T cells have significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype CD8+ T cells specific for YFV.

However, without a proper biological understanding of the pleiotropic working of genetic variants, a fundamental assumption of Mendelian Randomization (the exclusion restriction) can always be contested.  Methods: We build upon and synthesize recent advances in the econometric literature on instrumental variables (IV) estimation that test and relax the exclusion restriction. Our Pleiotropy-robust Mendelian Randomization (PRMR) method first estimates the degree of pleiotropy, and in turn corrects for it. If a sample exists for which the genetic variants do not affect the exposure, and pleiotropic effects are homogenous, PRMR obtains unbiased estimates of causal effects in case of pleiotropy.  Results: Simulations show that existing MR methods produce biased estimators for realistic forms of pleiotropy. Under the aforementioned assumptions, PRMR produces unbiased estimators. We illustrate the practical use of PRMR by estimating the causal effect of (i) cigarettes smoked per day on Body Mass Index (BMI); (ii) prostate cancer on self-reported health, and (iii) educational attainment on BMI in the UK Biobank data.  Conclusions: PRMR allows for instrumental variables that violate the exclusion restriction due to pleiotropy, and corrects for pleiotropy in the estimation of the causal effect.

When interpreting effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of group differences, researchers typically use Cohen's guidelines of small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects. However, these guidelines were only proposed for use when the effect size distribution (ESD) was unknown. Despite the availability of effect sizes from hundreds of HRV studies, researchers still largely rely on Cohen's guidelines to interpret effect sizes. This article describes an ESD analysis of 297 HRV effect sizes from case-control studies, revealing that the 25th, 50th, and 75th effect size percentiles correspond with effect sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.84, respectively. The ESD for separate clinical groups are also presented. The data suggests that Cohen's guidelines underestimate the magnitude of small and large effect sizes for the body of HRV case-control research. Therefore, to better reflect observed HRV effect sizes, the data suggest that effect sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.85 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects.

As mimetic musculature is examined in the most ancient specimens up to the most recent, there is a general trend towards an increase in size of corrugator supercillii and triangularis.  Homo ergaster's mimetic musculature closely resembles modern Homo, both in size and in location; furthermore, Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis share many muscular features.  The extinct human species had an elaborate and highly graded facial communication system, but it remained qualitatively different from that reported in modern Homo.

However, the mechanisms that partition the genome into TADs and the nature of domain boundaries are still poorly understood.

We have investigated boundary regions in the Drosophila genome and find that they can be identified as domains of very low H3K27me3. The genome-wide H3K27me3 profile partitions into two states; very low H3K27me3 identifies Depleted (D) domains that contain housekeeping genes and their regulators such as the histone acetyltransferase-containing NSL complex, whereas domains containing mid-to-high levels of H3K27me3 (Enriched or E domains) are associated with regulated genes, irrespective of whether they are active or inactive. The D domains correlate with the boundaries of TADs and are enriched in a subset of architectural proteins, particularly Chromator, BEAF-32, and Z4/Putzig. However, rather than being clustered at the borders of these domains, these proteins bind throughout the H3K27me3-depleted regions and are much more strongly associated with the transcription start sites of housekeeping genes than with the H3K27me3 domain boundaries.

We suggest that the D domain chromatin state, characterised by very low H3K27me3 and established by housekeeping gene regulators, acts to separate topological domains thereby setting up the domain architecture of the genome.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE169.pdf,"[( 05 Sep 2016 , 7), ( 18 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 02 Sep 2016 , 13), ( 05 Dec 2016 , 1), ( 08 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 01 Sep 2016 , 14), ( 06 Sep 2016 , 5)]"

The Eastern Yellow Robin, a widespread Australian bird, shows a deep mitochondrial split that is perpendicular to north-south nuclear DNA and plumage colour differentiation. We proposed a scenario to explain this pattern: (1) the two nuclear and mitochondrial genomes differentiated in concert during north-south population divergence; (2) later, their histories disconnected after two mitochondrial introgression events resulting in a deep mitochondrial split perpendicular to the nuclear DNA structure. We tested this scenario by coalescent modelling of ten mitochondrial genes and 400 nuclear DNA loci. Initial mitochondrial and nuclear genome divergences were estimated to have occurred in the early Pleistocene, consistent with the proposed scenario. Subsequent climatic transitions may have driven later mitochondrial introgression. We reject neutral introgression and consider evidence consistent with adaptive mitochondrial introgression and selection against incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear combinations.

We use metabolic profiling in Drosophila melanogaster to complete this missing step, with a view to examining variation in male and female metabolic profiles, or metabolomes, throughout development.

The conquest of the land from aquatic habitats is a fascinating evolutionary event that happened multiple times in different phyla. Mollusks are among the organisms that successfully invaded the non-marine realm, resulting in the radiation of terrestrial panpulmonate gastropods. We compared transcriptomes from panpulmonates to study the selective pressures that modeled the transitions from marine into freshwater and terrestrial realms in this molluscan lineage.

Results
De novo assembly of six panpulmonate transcriptomes resulted in 55,000 - 97,000 predicted open reading frames, of which 9 - 14% were functionally annotated. Adding published transcriptomes, we predicted 791 ortholog clusters shared among fifteen panpulmonate species, resulting in 702 amino acid and 736 codon-wise alignments. The branch-site test of positive selection applied to the codon-wise alignments showed twenty-eight genes under positive selection in the freshwater lineages and seven in the terrestrial lineages. Gene ontology categories of these candidate genes include actin assembly, transport of glucose, and the tyrosine metabolism in the terrestrial lineages; and, DNA repair, metabolism of xenobiotics, mitochondrial electron transport, and ribosome biogenesis in the freshwater lineages. 

Conclusions
We identified candidate genes representing processes that may have played a key role during the water-to-land transition in Panpulmonata. These genes were involved in energy metabolism and gas-exchange surface development in the terrestrial lineages and in the response to the abiotic stress factors (UV radiation, osmotic pressure, xenobiotics) in the freshwater lineages. Our study expands the knowledge of possible adaptive signatures in genes and metabolic pathways related to the invasion of non-marine habitats in invertebrates.

Here, we employ an exon capture dataset, demographic methods, and species distribution modeling to elucidate the impact of historical demography on patterns of genealogical concordance and discordance in ground squirrel lineages from the Otospermophilus beecheyi species complex. Previous studies in O. beecheyi revealed three morphologically cryptic and highly divergent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages (named the Northern, Central, and Southern lineages based on geography) with only the Northern lineage exhibiting concordant divergence in nuclear markers. We show that these mtDNA lineages likely formed in allopatry during the Pleistocene, but responded differentially to climatic changes that occurred since the last interglacial (~120,000 years ago). We find that the Northern lineage maintained a stable range throughout this period, correlating with genetic distinctiveness among all genetic markers and low migration rates between the other lineages. In contrast, our results support a scenario where the Southern lineage expanded from Baja California Sur during the Late Pleistocene and hybridized with the Central lineage, eventually driving the Central lineage to extinction. While high intraspecific gene flow among newly colonized populations eroded significant signals of Central ancestry from autosomal markers, male sex-biased dispersal in this system preserved signals of this past hybridization and introgression event in matrilineal-biased X-chromosome and mtDNA markers.

Here, by use of CD and NMR spectroscopy, we succeeded in differentiating the effects on a small but well-folded protein WW4, of GdmCl and NaSCN at diluted concentrations (≤200 mM). Both denaturants up to 200 mM have no alternation of its average structure but do reduce its thermodynamic stability to different degrees. Despite acting as the stronger denaturant, GdmCl only weakly interacts with amide protons, while NaSCN shows extensive interactions with both hydrophobic side chains and amide protons. Although both denaturants show no significant perturbation on overall ps-ns backbone dynamics of WW4, GdmCl suppresses while NaSCN enhances its μs-ms backbone dynamics in a denaturant concentration dependent manner. Quantitative analysis reveals that although they dramatically raise exchange rates, GdmCl slightly increases while NaSCN reduces the population of the major conformational state.

However, donor human livers are in chronically short supply, both for transplantation or as decellularised scaffolds, and will become even scarcer as life expectancy increases. It is hence of interest to determine the structural and biochemical properties of human hepatic ECM to derive design criteria for engineering bio-mimetic scaffolds. The intention of this work was to obtain quantitative design specifications for fabricating scaffolds for hepatic tissue engineering using human livers as a template. To this end, hepatic samples from 5 human donors were decellularised using a protocol shown to reproducibly conserve matrix composition and micro-structure in porcine livers. The decellularisation outcome was evaluated through histological and quantitative image analyses to evaluate cell removal, protein and glycosaminoglycan content per unit area. Applying the same decellularisation protocol to human liver samples obtained from 5 different donors yielded 5 different outcomes. Only 1 liver out of 5 was completely decellularised, while the other 4 showed different levels of remaining cells. Moreover, protein and glycosaminoglycan content per unit area after decellularisation were also found to be donor-dependent. The donor-to-donor variability of human livers thus precludes their use as templates for engineering a generic 'one-size fits all' ECM-mimic hepatic scaffold.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2035.pdf,"[( 04 Sep 2016 , 7), ( 08 Sep 2016 , 2)]"

In particular, many clustering methods have been employed to tackle this problem in a purely data-driven manner. Yet, existing methods leveraging high-throughput molecular data often suffers from various limitations, e.g., noise, data heterogeneity, high dimensionality or poor interpretability. Here we introduced an Entropy-based Consensus Clustering (ECC) method that overcomes those limitations all together. Our ECC method employs an entropy-based utility function to fuse many basic partitions to a consensus one that agrees with the basic ones as much as possible. Maximizing the utility function in ECC has a much more meaningful interpretation than any other consensus clustering methods. Moreover, we exactly map the complex utility maximization problem to the classic K-means clustering problem with a modified distance function, which can then be efficiently solved with linear time and space complexity. Our ECC method can also naturally integrate multiple molecular data types measured from the same set of subjects, and easily handle missing values without any imputation. We applied ECC to both synthetic and real data, including 35 cancer gene expression benchmark datasets and 13 cancer types with four molecular data types from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Result: We present a novel scalable algorithm for identifying genome-wide regulatory network structures. The highlight of our method is that its superior performance does not degenerate even for a network size on the order of $10^4$, and is thus readily applicable to large-scale complex networks. Such a breakthrough is achieved by considering both prior biological knowledge and multiple topological properties (i.e., sparsity and hub gene structure) of complex networks in the regularized formulation. We also illustrate the application of our algorithm in practice using the time-course expression data from an influenza infection study in respiratory epithelial cells.

However, there is a large discrepancy in estimated divergence times of major pine clades among existing studies mainly due to differences in fossil placement and dating methods used. We currently lack a dated molecular pine phylogeny that makes full usage of the rich fossil record in pines. This study is the first to estimate the divergence dates of pines based on a large number of fossils (21) evenly distributed across all major clades in combination with applying the most novel dating method.
Results: We present a range of molecular phylogenetic trees of Pinus generated within a Bayesian framework using both the novel fossilized birth-death and the traditional node dating method with different fossil sets. We find the origin of pines likely to be up to 30 Myr older (Early Cretaceous) than inferred in most previous studies (Late Cretaceous) and propose generally older divergence times for major clades within Pinus than previously thought. Our age estimates vary significantly between the different dating approaches but the results generally agree on older divergence times. We present a revised list of 21 fossils that are suitable to use in dating or comparative analyses of pines. 
Conclusions: An accurate timescale for the divergence times in pines is essential if we are to link diversification processes and functional adaptation of this genus to geological events or to changing climates. Next to older divergence times in Pinus, our results indicate that node age estimates in pines depend on dating approaches and fossil sets used due to different inherent characteristics of dating approaches. Our set of dated phylogenetic trees of pines presented herein provide the basis to account for uncertainties in age estimations when applying comparative phylogenetic methods, which will improve our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological history in pines.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Evolutionary Biology/BMC Evolutionary Biology11.pdf,"[( 28 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 27 Mar 2017 , 2), ( 06 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 05 Sep 2016 , 11)]"

Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barre syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.  Methods and findings: The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barre syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barre syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.  Conclusions:  Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge.

In what dynamical regime does the neuronal population operate in order to achieve this? Here, we simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons in lumbar spinal circuits and establish the neuronal fraction that operates within either a 'mean driven' or a 'fluctuation driven' regime during generation of multiple motor behaviors. We find a rich diversity of firing rates across the neuronal population as reflected in a lognormal distribution and demonstrate that half of the neurons spend at least 50% of the time in the 'fluctuation driven' regime regardless of behavior. Since neurons in this regime have a 'supralinear' input/output curve, which enhances sensitivity, whereas the mean driven regime reduces sensitivity, this fraction may reflect a fine trade off between stability and sensitivity in order to maintain flexibility across motor behaviors.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife100.pdf,"[( 08 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 06 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 5)]"

To model and understand the connection between coding-region sequence and 5'UTR intron status, we developed a classifier that can predict 5'UTR intron status with >80% accuracy using only sequence features in the early coding region. Thus, the classifier identifies transcripts with 5' proximal-intron-minus-like-coding regions (""5IM"" transcripts). Unexpectedly, we found that the early coding sequence features defining 5IM transcripts are widespread, appearing in 21% of all human RefSeq transcripts. The 5IM class of transcripts is enriched for non-AUG start codons, more extensive secondary structure both preceding the start codon and near the 5' cap, greater dependence on eIF4E for translation, and association with ER-proximal ribosomes. 5IM transcripts are bound by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) at non-canonical 5' proximal positions. Finally, N1-methyladenosines are specifically enriched in the early coding regions of 5IM transcripts. Taken together, our analyses point to the existence of a distinct 5IM class comprising ~20% of human transcripts.  This class is defined by depletion of 5' proximal introns, presence of specific RNA sequence features associated with low translation efficiency, N1-methyladenosines in the early coding region, and enrichment for non-canonical binding by the Exon Junction Complex.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/RNA/RNA5.pdf,"[( 07 Jun 2016 , 11)]"

However, the mechanisms that underpinned this population recovery remain largely unknown. As part of this study, we sequenced and analyzed whole genomes from multiple captive individuals. Following this analysis, we observed that the milu experienced a prolonged population decline over the last 200,000 years, which led to an elongated history of inbreeding. This protracted inbreeding history facilitated the purging of deleterious recessive alleles, thereby ameliorating associated threats to population viability. Because of this phenomenon, milu are now believed to be less susceptible to future inbreeding depression occurrences. SNP distribution patterns confirmed inbreeding history and also indicated sign of increased and increasing diversity in the recovered milu population. A selective sweep analysis identified two outlier genes (CTSR2 and GSG1) that were related to male fertility. Furthermore, we observed strong signatures of selection pertaining to the host immune system, including six genes (SERPINE1, PDIA3, CD302, IGLL1, VPREB3, and CD53 antigen), which are likely to strengthen resistance to pathogens. We also identified several adaptive features including the over-representation of gene families encoding for olfactory receptor activity, a high selection pressure pertaining to DNA repair and host immunity, and tolerance to high-salt swamp diets.

Borrowing insights from the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific contests, but also in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior, then population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in demographic rates. We modeled a population with a boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their non-aggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive types into a homogeneous non-aggressive population increases the average per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait; we suggest some concrete predictions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Behavioral Ecology/Behavioral Ecology2.pdf,"[( 08 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 09 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 06 Sep 2016 , 7), ( 07 Sep 2016 , 1)]"

Metagenome sequencing generates short reads from throughout the genomes of a microbial community. Increasingly large, multi-sample metagenomes, stratified in space and time are being generated from communities with thousands of species. Repeats result in fragmentary co-assemblies with potentially millions of contigs. Contigs can be binned into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) but strain level variation will remain. DESMAN identifies variants on core genes, then uses co-occurrence across samples to link variants into strain sequences and abundance profiles. These strain profiles are then searched for on non-core genes to determine the accessory genes present in each strain.

Results: We validated DESMAN on a synthetic twenty genome 
community with 64 samples. We could resolve the five E. coli strains present with 99.58% accuracy across core gene variable sites and their gene complement with 95.7% accuracy. Similarly, on real fecal metagenomes from the 2011 E. coli (STEC) O104:H4 outbreak, the outbreak strain was reconstructed with 99.8% core sequence accuracy. Application to an anaerobic digester metagenome time series reveals that strain level variation is endemic with 16 out of 26 MAGs (61.5%) examined exhibiting two strains. In almost all cases the strain 
proportions were not statistically different between replicate

Over the past several years, much progress has been made in the area of SV detection, but predict-ing the functional impact of SVs discovered in whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies remains extremely challenging. Accurate SV impact prediction is especially important for WGS-based rare variant association studies and studies of rare disease.
Results: Here we present SVScore, a computational tool for in silico SV impact prediction. SVScore aggregates existing per-base single nucleotide polymorphism pathogenicity scores across relevant genomic intervals for each SV in a manner that considers variant type, gene features, and uncertainty in breakpoint location. We show that in a Finnish cohort, the allele frequency spectrum of SVs with high impact scores is strongly skewed toward lower frequencies, suggesting that these variants are under purifying selection. We further show that SVScore identifies deleterious variants more effectively than naive alternative methods. Finally, our results indicate that high-scoring tandem duplications may be under surprisingly strong selection relative to high-scoring deletions, suggesting that duplications may be more deleterious than previously thought. In conclusion, SVScore provides pathogenicity prediction for SVs that is both informative and meaningful for understanding their functional role in disease.

Homeotic genes code for key transcription factors (HOX-TFs) that pattern the animal body plan. During embryonic development, Hox genes are expressed in overlapping patterns and function in a partially redundant manner. In vitro biochemical screens probing the HOX-TF sequence specificity revealed largely overlapping sequence preferences, indicating that co-factors might modulate the biological function of HOX-TFs. However, due to their overlapping expression pattern, high protein homology, and insufficiently specific antibodies, little is known about their genome-wide binding preferences. In order to overcome this problem, we virally expressed tagged versions of limb-expressed posterior Hox genes (Hoxa9-13, and Hoxd9-13) in primary mesenchymal limb progenitor cells (micromass). We determined the effect of each HOX-TF on cellular differentiation (chondrogenesis) and gene expression and found that groups of HOX-TFs induce distinct regulatory programs. We used ChIP-seq to determine their individual genome-wide binding profiles and identified between 12,540 and 27,466 binding sites for each of the nine HOX-TFs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of binding profiles revealed that the HOX-TFs are clustered in two subgroups (Group 1: HOXA/D9, HOXA/D10, HOXD12, and HOXA13 and Group 2: HOXA/D11 and HOXD13), which are characterized by differences in their sequence specificity and by the presence of cofactor motifs. Specifically, we identified CTCF binding sites in Group 1, indicating that this subgroup of HOX-proteins cooperates with CTCF. We confirmed this interaction by an independent biological assay (proximity ligation assay) and showed that CTCF is a novel HOX cofactor that specifically associates with Group 1 HOX-TFs, pointing towards a possible interplay between HOX-TFs and chromatin architecture.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics85.pdf,"[( 17 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 11 Sep 2016 , 5), ( 06 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 07 Sep 2016 , 19)]"

Rubisco (Ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the most important enzyme on earth, catalyzing the first step of CO2 fixation in photosynthesis. Its molecular adaptation to C4 photosynthetic pathway has attracted a lot of attention. C4 plants, which comprise less than 5% of land plants, have evolved more efficient photosynthesis compared to C3 plants. Interestingly, a large number of independent transitions from C3 to C4 phenotype have occurred. Each time, the Rubisco enzyme has been subject to similar changes in selective pressure, thus providing an excellent model for convergent evolution at the molecular level. Molecular adaptation is often identified with positive selection and is typically characterized by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). However, convergent adaptation is expected to leave a different molecular signature, taking the form of repeated transitions toward identical or similar amino acids.
Here, we use a previously introduced codon-based differential selection model to detect and quantify consistent patterns of convergent adaptation in Rubisco in Amaranthaceae. We further contrast the results thus obtained with those obtained under classical codon models based on the estimation of dN/dS. We find that the two classes of models tend to select distinct, although overlapping, sets of positions. This discrepancy in the results illustrates the conceptual difference between these models, while emphasizing the need to better discriminate between qualitatively different selective regimes, by using a broader class of codon models than those currently considered in molecular evolutionary studies.

Each morph has unique morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profiles that shift the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review the main immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses reviewed, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis and its derivatives have generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Generally, greater understanding would occur if hypotheses and predictions were always explicitly articulated and several hypotheses with mutually exclusive predictions are addressed simultaneously. Integration has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms' evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort.

This process has been largely considered as occurring before movement onset and has been traditionally associated with reaction time. However, in a virtual line bisection task, we observed an overlap between movement planning and execution.
In this task performed with a robotic manipulandum, we observed that the participants (N=30) made straight movements when the line was in front of them (near target) but made often curved movements towards a farther target that was located sideways in such a way that they crossed the line perpendicular to it. Unexpectedly, movements to the far targets had shorter reaction times than movements to the near target (mean difference: 32ms, SE: 5ms, max: 104ms). In addition, the curvature of the movement modulated reaction time. A larger increase in movement curvature from the near to the far target was associated with a larger reduction in reaction time. These highly curved movements started with a transport phase during which accuracy demands was not taken into account.
We concluded that accuracy demand imposes a reaction time penalty if it is processed before movement onset. This penalty is reduced if the start of the movement can consist of a transport phase and if the movement plan can be refined in function of accuracy demands later in the movement, hence demonstrating an overlap between movement planning and execution.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2052.pdf,"[( 11 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 02 Jun 2016 , 3)]"

Here we investigate with unprecedented detail the transcriptome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, a medically important and innately multi-drug resistant bacterium. We systematically mapped RNA cleavage and dephosphorylation sites that result in 5'-monophosphate terminated RNA using a new high-throughput methodology called monophosphate RNA-Seq (pRNA-Seq). Transcriptional start sites (TSS) were also mapped using differential RNA-Seq (dRNA-Seq) and both datasets were compared to conventional RNA-Seq performed in a variety of growth conditions.  Results: The pRNA-Seq transcript library revealed known tRNA, rRNA and tmRNA processing sites, together with previously uncharacterized RNA cleavage events that were found disproportionately near the 5' ends of transcripts associated with basic bacterial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation and purine metabolism. The majority (97%) of the processed mRNAs were cleaved at precise codon positions within defined sequence motifs indicative of distinct endonucleolytic activities. The most abundant of these motifs corresponded closely to an E. coli RNase E site previously established in vitro. Using the dRNA-Seq library, we performed an operon analysis and predicted 3,159 potential TSS. A correlation analysis uncovered 105 antiparallel pairs of TSS that were separated by 18 bp from each other and that were centered on a palindromic TAT(A/T)ATA motif, suggesting that such sites may provide a novel form of transcriptional regulation. TSS and RNA-Seq analysis allowed us to confirm expression of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which are differentially expressed in swarming and biofilm formation conditions.  Conclusions: This study introduces pRNA-Seq methodology, which provides the first comprehensive, genome-wide survey of RNA processing in any organism. As a proof of concept, we have employed this technique to study the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and have discovered extensive transcript processing not previously appreciated.

In the basal ganglia, oscillations are also present at many levels and a wide range of characteristic frequencies have been reported to occur during both health and disease.The striatum is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia that receives massive glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and is highly susceptible to cortical oscillations. However, there is limited knowledge about the exact nature of this routing process and therefore, it is of key importance to understand how time-dependent, periodic external stimuli propagate through the striatal circuitry. Using a large-scale network model of the striatum and corticostriatal projections, here we try to elucidate the importance of specific GABAergic neurons and their interactions in shaping striatal oscillatory activity. Our results show that fast-spiking interneurons, despite their uncorrelated firing, might have a crucial role in the emergence of high-frequency oscillations in the medium spiny neuron population, even if their activity is kept low. Rather, what matters is the firing time relative to just a few other neurons within an oscillation cycle. Finally, we show how the state of ongoing activity, the strengths of different types of inhibitions, the density of outgoing projections, and the overall activity of striatal cells influence network activity. These results suggest that the propagation of oscillatory inputs into the medium spiny neuron population is efficient, if indirect, through fast-spiking interneurons. Therefore, pharmaceuticals that target fast-spiking interneurons may provide a novel treatment for regaining the spectral characteristics of striatal activity that correspond to the healthy state.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE170.pdf,"[( 10 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 07 Sep 2016 , 7)]"

Dengvaxia is a vaccine candidate now licensed in several countries for individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic countries with least 70% of seroprevalence. Modelers from Sanofi Pasteur have predicted that this vaccine has the potential to reduce by about 50% the disease burden within 5 years when 20% of an endemic country population is vaccinated, thus achieving a World Health Organization dengue prevention goal. 

In this paper, mathematical modeling is used to investigate the impact of the newly licensed dengue vaccine using different scenarios. Our results show that to achieve significant reduction in disease burden, the vaccination program is most effective if it includes only individuals that have been already exposed to at least one dengue virus. Immunological screening of the population prior to vaccination is advised and vaccination strategies must be planned based on epidemiological disease dynamics for each specific endemic region.

Here, for the first time, we perform a systematic survey of the heritability and the distribution of effect sizes across all representative tissues in the human body. We find that local h2 can be relatively well characterized with 59% of expressed genes showing significant h2 (FDR < 0.1) in the DGN whole blood cohort. However, current sample sizes (n ≤ 922) do not allow us to compute distal h2. Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) analysis provides strong evidence that the genetic contribution to local expression traits is dominated by a handful of genetic variants rather than by the collective contribution of a large number of variants each of modest size. In other words, the local architecture of gene expression traits is sparse rather than polygenic across all 40 tissues (from DGN and GTEx) examined. This result is confirmed by the sparsity of optimal performing gene expression predictors via elastic net modeling. To further explore the tissue context specificity, we decompose the expression traits into cross-tissue and tissue-specific components using a novel Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition (OTD) approach. Through a series of simulations we show that the cross-tissue and tissue-specific components are identifiable via OTD. Heritability and sparsity estimates of these derived expression phenotypes show similar characteristics to the original traits. Consistent properties relative to prior GTEx multi-tissue analysis results suggest that these traits reflect the expected biology.

It does not rely on precise positional information, permitting large cell movements between frames and enabling tracking in datasets acquired at low temporal resolution due to experimental constraints such as photoxicity.

Therefore, regardless of  incompatibility with high-resolution structural analysis, many structural models of PrPSc have been hypothesized based on limited structural information and, recently models consisting solely of β-sheets and intervening loops/kinks have been suggested, i.e. parallel in-register β-sheet models and β-solenoid model. Given the relatively simple structural models of PrPSc, we utilized values of theoretical β-sheet or random-coil propensity (Pβ or Pc, respectively) calculated by secondary structure prediction with a neural network to analyze interspecies transmissions of prion, because numerical conversion of the primary structures would enable quantitative comparison of PrP with distinct primary structures.

This confounding aspect is frequently ignored in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data. In this article, we demonstrate that failing to consider plate effects in the statistical model results in loss of type I error control. A solution is proposed whereby counts are summed from all cells in each plate and the count sums for all plates are used in the DE analysis. This restores type I error control in the presence of plate effects without compromising detection power in simulated data. Summation is also robust to varying numbers and library sizes of cells on each plate.

Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling. Alongside experimental studies, computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate these processes. To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. It is difficult to accurately compare between different modelling approaches, since one cannot distinguish between differences in behaviour due to the underlying model assumptions and those due to differences in the numerical implementation of the model. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling.

Visual representations are necessary to understand individual rules as well as analyze interactions of hundreds of rules, which motivates the need for automated diagramming tools for rule-based models. Here, we present a theoretical framework that unifies the layers of information in a rule-based model and enables automated visualization of (i) the mechanism encoded in a rule, (ii) the regulatory interaction of two or more rules, and (iii) the emergent network architecture of a large rule set. Specifically, we present a compact rule visualization that conveys the action of a rule explicitly (unlike conventional visualizations), a regulatory graph visualization that conveys regulatory interactions between rules, and a set of graph compression methods that synthesize informative pathway diagrams from complex regulatory graphs. These methods enable inference of network motifs (such as feedback and feed-forward loops), automated generation of signal flow diagrams for hundreds of rules, and tunable network compression using heuristics and graph analysis, all of which are advances over the state of the art for rule-based models. These methods also produce more readable diagrams than currently available tools as we show with an empirical comparison across 27 published rule-based models of various sizes. We provide an implementation in the open source and freely available BioNetGen framework, but the underlying methods are applicable to all current rule-based models in BioNetGen, Kappa and Simmune frameworks.

Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRI's successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity.

Coalescent analysis typically involves applying statistical methods to either samples of genetic sequences or an estimated genealogy in order to estimate the demographic history of the population from which the samples originated. Several parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques, employing diverse methods, such as Gaussian processes and Monte Carlo particle filtering, already exist. However, these techniques often trade estimation accuracy and sophistication for methodological flexibility and ease of use. Thus, there is room for new coalescent estimation techniques that can be easily implemented for a range of inference problems while still maintaining some sense of statistical optimality.

Here we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter as a natural, easily implementable and flexible minimum mean square error estimator for parametric demographic functions. By reinterpreting the coalescent as a self-correcting inhomogeneous Poisson process, we show that the Snyder filter can be applied to both isochronous (sampled at one time point) and heterochronous (serially sampled) estimation problems. We test the estimation performance of the filter on both standard, simulated demographic models and on a well-studied empirical dataset comprising hepatitis C virus sequences from Egypt. Additionally, we provide some analytical insight into the relationship between the Snyder filter and popular maximum likelihood and skyline plot techniques for coalescent inference. The Snyder filter is an exact and direct Bayesian estimation method that provides optimal mean square error estimates.

The Ebola ça suffit trial in Guinea used a novel ring vaccination cluster randomized design to target populations at highest risk of infection. Another key feature of the trial was the use of a delayed vaccination arm as a comparator, in which clusters were randomized to immediate vaccination or vaccination 21 days later. This approach, chosen to improve ethical acceptability of the trial, complicates the statistical analysis as participants in the comparison arm are eventually protected by vaccine. Furthermore, for infectious diseases, we observe time of illness onset and not time of infection, and we may not know the time required for the vaccinee to develop a protective immune response. As a result, including events observed shortly after vaccination may bias the per protocol estimate of vaccine efficacy. We provide a framework for approximating the bias and power of any given per protocol analysis period as functions of the background infection hazard rate, disease incubation period, and vaccine immune response. We use this framework to provide recommendations for designing standard vaccine efficacy trials and trials with a delayed vaccination comparator. Briefly, narrower analysis periods within the correct window can minimize or eliminate bias but may suffer from reduced power.

As such, QS can be considered the most primordial form of language. QS has profound implications for the control of many important traits (e.g. biofilm formation, secretion of virulence factors, etc.). Conceptually, the QS response can be split into its ""listening"" and ""speaking"" components, i.e. the power to sense AI levels vs. the ability to synthesize and release these molecules. By explaining the cell-density dependence of QS behavior as the consequence of the system's arrival to a threshold AI concentration, models of QS have traditionally assumed a salient role for the ""QS speaking"" module during bacterial cell-to-cell communication. In this paper, we have provided evidence that challenges this AI-centered view of QS and establishes LuxR-like activators at the center of QS. Our observation that highly coordinated, cell-density dependent responses can occur in the absence of AI production, implies that the ability to launch such responses is engrained within the ""QS listening"" module. Our data indicates that once a critical threshold of intracellular activator monomers in complex with AI is reached, a highly orchestrated QS response ensues. While displaying a clear cell-density dependence, such response does not strictly require the sensing of population levels by individual cells. We additionally show, both in vivo and in silico, that despite their synchronous nature, QS responses do not require that all the cells in the population participate in the response. Central to our analysis was the discovery that percolation theory (PT) can be used to mathematically describe QS responses. While groundbreaking, our results are in agreement with and integrate the latest conclusions reached in the field. We explain for the first time, the cell-density-dependent synchronicity of QS responses as the function of a single protein, the LuxR-like activator, capable of coordinating the temporal response of a population of cells in the absence of cell-to-cell communication.

Most studies have either examined environmental variation without accounting for covariation, or examined phenotypic and genetic covariation without distinguishing the environmental component. In this study we examined the effect of mutational perturbations on different properties of environmental covariation, as well as mean shape. We use strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing well-characterized mutations known to influence wing shape, as well as naturally-derived strains, all reared under carefully-controlled conditions and with the same genetic background. We find that mean shape changes more freely than the covariance structure, and that different properties of the covariance matrix change independently from each other. The perturbations affect matrix orientation more than they affect matrix eccentricity or total variance. Yet, mutational effects on matrix orientation do not cluster according to the developmental pathway that they target.

The relative abundance of species, which informs us about the commonness and rarity of species, changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The average number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase, followed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in a given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species close-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the geographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated. This reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a region, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships.
Within a neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent, we introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for birth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the pair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the conditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a given circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we have referred to above, and compare the analytical formulae with the numerical integration of the model.

by the weight of their seeds, which in the model determines the competition
preference. Heavier seeds have a better chance for  germination from a

These metrics include steady state gain, response time, overshoot, peak time and peak duration. For the motifs with a negative feedback component, it can be seen that AND-gated motifs show a ""feedforward-like"" property whereas the OR-gated motifs show a ""feedback-like"" property. Motifs with a positive feedback component show hypersensitivity of gain, to parameters. Overshoot correlates negatively with peak time whereas peak duration correlates concavely with peak time, a property that is also observed for uncoupled feedback and feedforward motifs.

Research identified factors required for axonal regeneration outside the CNS, but little is known about regeneration triggered by dendrotomy. Here we study neuronal plasticity triggered by dendrotomy and determine the fate of complex PVD arbors following laser surgery of dendrites. We find that severed primary dendrites grow towards each other and reconnect via branch fusion. Simultaneously, terminal branches lose self-avoidance and grow towards each other, meeting and fusing at the tips via an AFF-1-mediated process. Ectopic branch growth is identified as a step in the regeneration process required for bypassing the lesion site. Failure of reconnection to the severed dendrites results in degeneration of the distal end of the neuron. We discover pruning of excess branches via EFF-1 that acts to recover the original wild-type arborization pattern in a cell-autonomous process. In contrast, AFF-1 activity during dendritic auto-fusion is derived from the lateral seam cells and not autonomously from the PVD neuron. We propose a model in which AFF-1-vesicles derived from the epidermal seam cells fuse neuronal dendrites from without. Thus, EFF-1 and AFF-1 fusion proteins emerge as new players in neuronal arborization and maintenance of arbor connectivity following injury in C. elegans. Our results demonstrate that there is a genetically determined multi-step pathway to repair broken dendrites in which EFF-1 and AFF-1 act on different steps of the pathway.

New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature, including dependence on the strength and age of memories, the interval between memory retrieval and extinction, and prediction errors following retrieval.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife104.pdf,"[( 22 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 8), ( 24 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 11 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 29 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 18 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 25 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 14 Jan 2016 , 2), ( 20 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 12 Jan 2016 , 5), ( 31 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 19 Jan 2017 , 1), ( 12 Sep 2016 , 23), ( 15 Sep 2016 , 1)]"

Here we propose to close this gap via symbolic regression. We validate our method using both synthetic and real data. We firstly show this method allows reverse engineering two-species ecosystems, inferring both the structure and the parameters of ordinary differential equation models that reveal the mechanisms behind the system dynamics.

However, the spatial distribution of information exchange loss/gain across the entire brain remains elusive. In the present study, we acquired and analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data in rats during wakefulness and graded levels of consciousness induced by incrementally increasing the concentration of isoflurane. We found that, regardless of spatial scale, the absolute functional connectivity (FC) change was significantly dependent on the FC strength at the awake state across all connections. This dependency became stronger at higher doses of isoflurane. In addition, the relative FC change (i.e. the FC change normalized to the corresponding FC strength at the awake state) exhibited a spatially homogenous reduction across the whole brain particularly after animals lost consciousness, indicating a globally uniform disruption of meaningful information exchange. To further support this notion, we showed that during unconsciousness, the entropy of rsfMRI signal increased to a value comparable to random noise while the mutual information decreased appreciably. Importantly, consistent results were obtained when unconsciousness was induced by dexmedetomidine, an anesthetic agent with a distinct molecular action than isoflurane. This result indicates that the observed global reduction in information exchange may be agent invariant. Taken together, these findings provide compelling neuroimaging evidence suggesting that the brain undergoes a widespread, uniform disruption in the exchange of meaningful information during AIU, and that this change may represent a common systems-level neural mechanism of AIU.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Brain Structure and Function/Brain Structure and Function3.pdf,"[( 12 Sep 2016 , 6)]"

Here reference genes are commonly used to normalize non-biological variation in mRNA levels and their appropriate selection is therefore essential for the accurate interpretation the collected data. In recent years the use of multiple validated references genes has been shown to substantially increase the robustness of the normalization. It is therefore considered good practice to experimentally validate putative reference genes under specific experimental conditions, determine the optimal number of reference genes to be employed, and report the method or methods used.
Under this premise, we assessed the current state of reference gene base normalization in RT-qPCR bivalve ecotoxicology studies (post 2011), employing a systematic quantitative literature review. A total of 52 papers published met our criteria and were analysed for the gene or genes used, whether they employed multiple reference genes, as well as the validation method employed. In addition we performed a case study using primary hemocytes from the marine bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum after in vitro copper exposure. Herein we further critically discuss methods for reference gene validation, including the established algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, as well as the popular online tool RefFinder.
We identified that RT-qPCR normalization in bivalve ecotoxicology studies is largely performed using single reference genes, while less than 40% of the studies attempted to experimentally validate the expression stability of the reference genes used. 18s rRNA and β-Actin were the most popular genes, yet their un-validated use did introduce artefactual variance that altered the interpretation of the resulting data, while the use of appropriately validated reference genes did substantially improve normalization. Our findings further suggest that combining the results from multiple individual algorithms and calculating the overall best-ranked gene, as e.g. computed by the RefFinder tool, does not by default lead to the identification of the most suitable reference gene or combination of reference genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Aquatic Toxicology/Aquatic Toxicology1.pdf,"[( 12 Sep 2016 , 7)]"

Principally, top-down influences appear to inform lower-order sensory systems of the current 'task at hand', and thus may convey behavioral context to these systems. Accumulating evidence indicates that top-down cortical influences are carried by directed interareal synchronization of oscillatory neuronal populations. An important question currently under investigation by a number of laboratories is whether the information conveyed by directed interareal synchronization depends on the frequency band in which it is conveyed. Recent results point to the beta frequency band as being particularly important for conveying task-related information. However, little is known about the nature of the information conveyed by top-down directed influences. To investigate the information content of top-down directed beta-frequency influences, we measured spectral Granger Causality using local field potentials recorded from microelectrodes chronically implanted in visual cortical areas V1, V4, and TEO, and then applied multivariate pattern analysis to the spatial patterns of top-down spectral Granger Causality in the visual cortex. We decoded behavioral context by discriminating patterns of top-down (V4/TEO -> V1) beta-peak spectral Granger Causality for two different task rules governing the correct responses to visual stimuli. The results indicate that top-down directed influences in visual cortex are carried by beta oscillations, and differentiate current task demands even before visual stimulus processing. They suggest that top-down beta-frequency oscillatory processes may coordinate the processing of sensory information by conveying global knowledge states to early levels of the sensory cortical hierarchy independently of bottom-up stimulus-driven processing.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2073.pdf,"[( 12 Sep 2016 , 8)]"

Without considering the centering of each particle projection, there are three degrees of freedoms (three Euler angles) that need to be fixed, usually resulting a computational complexity O(n3) where n is the number of discretization for each rotation angle. Here, we propose a method based on Maximum Likelihood approach with angular auto-correlation function of each projection, which is utilized to decouple the determination of three Euler angles to stepwise determination of two Euler angles and the subsequent third angle, the in-plane rotation.

We first provided a statistical framework for quantifying IEB then identified real examples of IEB in a range of study and analytical designs. We observed evidence of biased associations for some disease alleles and genetic risk scores, even in population-based studies.

Our analysis suggested that the associations between CCND2 and TCF7L2 diabetes risk alleles and BMI could (at least partially) be explained by IEB.

1.	Cost, time, and expertise constraints limit traditional observation-based comprehensive biodiversity assessment. Therefore, surrogate focal taxa representative of wider biodiversity are commonly used as an imperfect ""proxy"". Contemporary biodiversity assessments are also increasingly benefiting from the combination of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic methodologies that enable identification of environmental DNA samples. However, there is a need for empirical studies combining the use of surrogate taxa with metagenomic approaches, that promise rapid and efficient biodiversity assessment.
2.	We here tested for the first time the possibility of using the intestinal contents of wild-collected dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) as a source of mammalian DNA, in a metagenomics proof-of-concept approach to directly detect and identify mammals from an area of savanna-scrub in southern Africa.  Dung beetles have been purveyed as an indirect proxy measure of mammalian diversity, owing to their dependence upon vertebrate dung as a food source, and the ease with which they can be comprehensively sampled using simple and repeatable trapping protocols, achievable much faster than vertebrate surveys.
3.	Following shotgun sequencing of gut content DNA extractions from ten dung beetle species, we used in silico filters to identify mammals by searching the resulting reads against known mammalian mitochondrial DNA from online sequence repositories, matching 546 paired reads to known mitogenomes held in GenBank, and 634 reads to known mammal barcode sequences held in BOLD. Identified mammalian sequences were consistent with wild and domesticated ungulates known from the sampling site, and included blue wildebeest, plains zebra, and domestic cattle and goat. Four dung beetle samples yielded sufficient sequence data to successfully assemble the near-complete mitogenome of blue wildebeest at up to 21 X mean coverage, despite low initial DNA concentrations, unambiguously corroborating identification.
4.	It is conceptually and practically possible to rapidly and economically apply metagenomic techniques in dung beetle gut sequencing to detect the presence of mammals upon whose dung the beetles have fed. Since the approach can be readily scaled up, it may prove to be of practical use as a complement to traditional biodiversity assessment methods, and should be tested in usefulness for detecting rare, endangered or cryptic mammal species.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2076.pdf,"[( 17 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 17), ( 16 Sep 2016 , 4), ( 18 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 14 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 27 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 15 Sep 2016 , 1)]"

We applied these methods to an RNAseq dataset from a neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line (ENCODE) differentiated or not using retinoic acid. We found that the predictions of the two pipelines overlapped (70% of exon skipping events were common), but with noticeable differences. The assembly-first approach allowed to find more novel variants, including novel unannotated exons and splice sites. It also predicted AS in families of paralog genes. The mapping-first approach allowed to find more lowly expressed splicing variants, and was better in predicting exons overlapping repeated elements. This work demonstrates that annotating AS with a single approach leads to missing a large number of candidates. We further show that these candidates cannot be neglected, since many of them are differentially regulated across conditions, and can be validated experimentally.

In particular, major significant chromatin features explaining the mutation landscape of Barrett′s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma were derived from stomach tissues, indicating that mutation landscape establishment occurs mostly after environment-mediated epigenetic changes during gastric metaplasia. Analyses of the genome of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues demonstrated that the proposed time point for mutation landscape establishment of Barrett′s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma were specific to the occurrence of cell-type shift.

To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing of lck:GFP cells in zebrafish to obtain the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a non-mammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cell TCR locus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T-cells, a novel type of NK-like cells and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune cell specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed a higher gene turnover and lower conservation of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research59.pdf,"[( 19 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 14 Sep 2016 , 4), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 12 Sep 2016 , 17), ( 10 Jan 2017 , 1)]"

During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle is aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a microtubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle is displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of centering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle during the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We found that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the transverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured by the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the cell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the fluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of the short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations in the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins underlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of one thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in these cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make contact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high stability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making contact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert compressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of microtubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning the spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of anaphase.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biophysical Journal/Biophysical Journal16.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 17 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 18 Jul 2016 , 4)]"

These estimates are used as input parameters for the MetaGAP calculator. Results from the calculator suggest that cross-study heterogeneity has led to attenuation of statistical power and predictive accuracy in recent large-scale GWAS efforts on these traits (e.g., for years of education, we estimate a relative loss of 51–62% in the number of genome-wide significant loci and a relative loss in polygenic score R2 of 36–38%).

Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple model of the complex mouse ovary, called “ŌvSim”. Simulating the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles over time, ŌvSim produces follicle numbers that closely match numbers predicted by histomorphometric and imaging analyses (e.g., follicle counts) and data on ovulatory rates. ŌvSim relies on the specification of three key parameters or inputs to the simulation: the probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily. When the probability of daily growth activation is near 0.005, granulosa cell survival is 0.88, and the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, ŌvSim simulates follicle growth in a fashion that closely matches biological measurements.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species, and conversely. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2084.pdf,"[( 07 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 06 Oct 2016 , 3), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 14)]"

While powerful, these methods cannot as of yet be applied to the entire RBPome.

Due to multiple levels of heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell RNA transcriptomics and computational modelling of temporal mixtures, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cell populations during Plasmodium infection in mice at single-cell resolution. These cell fates emerged from a common, highly proliferative and metabolically active precursor. Moreover, by tracking clonality from T cell receptor sequences, we infer that ancestors derived from the same naïve CD4+ T cell can concurrently populate both Th1 and Tfh subsets. We further found that precursor T cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate by monocytes/macrophages. The integrated genomic and computational approach we describe is applicable for analysis of any cellular system characterized by differentiation towards multiple fates.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2086.pdf,"[( 22 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 9), ( 05 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jan 2017 , 1), ( 14 Sep 2016 , 13), ( 20 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 28 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 15 Sep 2016 , 4)]"

For example, yeast cells in galactose induce GAL genes with a speed and unanimity that depends on previous nutrient conditions. To investigate how cell-level gene expression dynamics produce population-level phenotypes, we built living vector fields from thousands of single-cell timecourses of the inducers Gal3p and Gal1p as cells switched to galactose from various nutrient histories. We show that, after sustained glucose exposure, the lack of GAL inducers leads to induction delays that are long but also variable; that cellular resources constrain induction; and that bimodally distributed expression levels arise from lineage selection - a subpopulation of cells induces more quickly and outcompetes the rest. Our results illuminate cellular memory in this important model system and illustrate how resources and randomness interact to shape the response of a population to a new environment.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular Systems Biology/Molecular Systems Biology8.pdf,"[( 08 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 07 Sep 2016 , 10)]"

In this scheme, the number of solutions, their spatial architectures and the correlations among them can be computed. As an example, we consider an ""allosteric"" task, which requires the material to respond specifically to a stimulus at a distant active site.  We find  that functioning materials evolve a less-constrained trumpet-shaped region connecting the stimulus and active sites  and that the amplitude of the elastic response  varies non-monotonically along the trumpet. As previously shown for some proteins, we find that correlations appearing during evolution alone are sufficient to identify key aspects of this design. Finally, we show that the success of this architecture stems from the emergence of soft edge modes recently found to appear near the surface of marginally connected materials.  Overall, our in silico evolution experiment offers  a new window to study the relationship between structure, function, and  correlations emerging during evolution.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print2087.pdf,"[( 13 Sep 2016 , 4)]"

Thus, the nose is sub-stratified into more than a thousand OSN subtypes. Here, we employ and validate an RNA-sequencing based method to quantify the abundance of all OSN subtypes in parallel, and investigate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to neuronal diversity. We find that the OSN subtype distribution is stereotyped in genetically identical mice, but varies extensively between different strains. Further, we identify cis-acting genetic variation as the greatest component influencing OSN composition and demonstrate independence from OR function. However, we show that olfactory stimulation with particular odorants results in modulation of dozens of OSN subtypes in a subtle but reproducible, specific and time-dependent manner.
