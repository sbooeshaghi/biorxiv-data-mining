"October 26, 2015",Effect of lossy compression of quality scores on variant calling,Briefings In Bioinformatics,"[(Ochoa, Idoia,  Stanford University), (Hernaez, Mikel,  Stanford University), (Goldfeder, Rachel,  Stanford University), (Weissman, Tsachy,  Stanford University), (Ashley, Euan,  Stanford University)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/029843 ,"Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of genome sequencing. This development has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed, and communicated. To facilitate this effort, compression of genomic files has been proposed. Specifically, lossy compression of quality scores is emerging as a natural candidate for reducing the growing costs of storage. A main goal of performing DNA sequencing in population studies and clinical settings is to identify genetic variation. Though the field agrees that smaller files are advantageous, the cost of lossy compression, in terms of variant discovery, is unclear.
 

Bioinformatic algorithms to identify SNPs and INDELs from next-generation DNA sequencing data use base quality score information; here, we evaluate the effect of lossy compression of quality scores on SNP and INDEL detection. We analyze several lossy compressors introduced recently in the literature. Specifically, we investigate how the output of the variant caller when using the original data (uncompressed) differs from that obtained when quality scores are replaced by those generated by a lossy compressor. Using gold standard genomic datasets such as the GIAB (Genome In A Bottle) consensus sequence for NA12878 and simulated data, we are able to analyze how accurate the output of the variant calling is, both for the original data and that previously lossily compressed. We show that lossy compression can significantly alleviate the storage while maintaining variant calling performance comparable to that with the uncompressed data. Further, in some cases lossy compression can lead to variant calling performance which is superior to that using the uncompressed file. We envisage our findings and framework serving as a benchmark in future development and analyses of lossy genomic data compressors.

Human-level visual recognition abilities are coming within reach of artificial systems. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the brain and their computations could be implemented in biological neurons. Convolutional feedforward networks, which now dominate computer vision, take further inspiration from the architecture of the primate visual hierarchy. However, the current models are designed with engineering goals and not to model brain computations. Nevertheless, initial studies comparing internal representations between these models and primate brains find surprisingly similar representational spaces. With human-level performance no longer out of reach, we are entering an exciting new era, in which we will be able to build neurobiologically faithful feedforward and recurrent computational models of how biological brains perform high-level feats of intelligence, including vision.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print822.pdf,"[( 01 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 06 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 26 Oct 2015 , 26), ( 13 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 05 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 28 Oct 2015 , 2), ( 09 Feb 2016 , 5), ( 13 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 27 Oct 2015 , 10), ( 31 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 30 Oct 2015 , 1)]"

The combination of an off axis pupil and the principle of chromatic aberration (where light of different colors focus at different distances behind a lens) can combine to provide color-blind animals with a way to distinguish colors. As a specific example we constructed a computer model of the visual system of cephalopods, (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) that have a single unfiltered photoreceptor type. Nevertheless, cephalopods dramatically change color both to produce chromatically matched camouflage and to signal conspecifics. This presents a paradox, an apparent ability to determine color in organisms with a monochromatic visual system that has been a long-standing puzzle. We demonstrate that chromatic blurring dominates the visual acuity in these animals, and we quantitatively show how chromatic aberration can be exploited, especially through non axial pupils that are characteristic of cephalopods, to obtain spectral information. This mechanism is consistent with the extensive suite of visual/behavioral and physiological data that have been obtained from cephalopod studies, and resolves the apparent paradox of vivid chromatic behaviors in color-blind animals. Moreover, this proposed mechanism has potential applicability in any organisms with limited photoreceptor complements, such as spiders and dolphins.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print823.pdf,"[( 24 Jan 2017 , 86), ( 06 May 2017 , 1), ( 16 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jul 2016 , 7), ( 07 May 2017 , 3), ( 12 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jan 2017 , 1)]"

We also compared the results of digital analysis with standard visual estimation. Percentages of p53 positive cells were higher by visual estimation than by digital analysis. However, correlation was high between both methods. Our study shows that evaluation of p53 immunohistochemical expression is feasible using open-source software packages for digital image analysis.

More accurate reconstructions of historical states are critical to understanding the processes governing past, current, and future forest dynamics. Gridded (8x8km) estimates of pre-settlement (1800s) forests from the upper Midwestern US (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of Michigan) using 19th Century Public Land Survey (PLS) records provide relative composition, biomass, stem density, and basal area for 26 tree genera. This mapping is more robust than past efforts, using spatially varying correction factors to accommodate sampling design, azimuthal censoring, and biases in tree selection.
We compare pre-settlement to modern forests using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, with respect to structural changes and the prevalence of lost forests, pre-settlement forests with no current analogue, and novel forests, modern forests with no past analogs. Differences between PLSS and FIA forests are spatially structured as a result of differences in the underlying ecology and land use impacts in the Upper Midwestern United States. Modern biomass is higher than pre-settlement biomass in the northwest (Minnesota and north-eastern Wisconsin, including regions that were historically open savanna), and lower in the east (eastern Wisconsin and Michigan), due to shifts in species composition and, presumably, average stand age. Modern forests are more homogeneous, and ecotonal gradients are more diffuse today than in the past. Novel forest assemblages represent 29% of all FIA cells, while 25% of pre-settlement forests no longer exist in a modern context.
Lost forests are centered around the forests of the Tension Zone, particularly in hemlock dominated forests of north-central Wisconsin, and in oak-elm-basswood forests along the forest-prairie boundary in south central Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin. Novel FIA forest assemblages are distributed evenly across the region, but novelty shows a strong relationship to spatial distance from remnant forests in the upper Midwest, with novelty predicted at between 20 to 60km from remnants, depending on historical forest type.
The spatial relationships between remnant and novel forests, shifts in ecotone structure and the loss of historic forest types point to significant challenges to land managers if landscape restoration is a priority in the region. The spatial signals of novelty and ecological change also point to potential challenges in using modern spatial distributions of species and communities and their relationship to underlying geophysical and climatic attributes in understanding potential responses to changing climate. The signal of human settlement on modern forests is broad, spatially varying and acts to homogenize modern forests relative to their historic counterparts, with significant implications for future management.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print825.pdf,"[( 17 Sep 2015 , 2), ( 25 Oct 2015 , 4), ( 13 Sep 2015 , 4), ( 18 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 11 Sep 2015 , 5)]"

By identifying these sufficient causal key events, we have fewer events to monitor for a pathway, thereby decreasing assay costs and time, while maximizing the value of the information. I have developed the ""aop"" package which uses back-door analysis of causal networks to identify these minimal sets of key events that are sufficient for making causal predictions.

In particular, it has proven difficult to exploit the information contained in the distribution of genealogies across the genome. We have previously shown that the generating function (GF) of genealogies can be used to analytically compute likelihoods of demographic models from configurations of mutations in short sequence blocks (Lohse et al., 2011). Although the GF has a simple, recursive form, the size of such likelihood computations explodes quickly with the number of individuals and applications of this framework have so far been limited to small samples (pairs and triplets) for which the GF can be written down by hand. Here we investigate several strategies for exploiting the inherent symmetries of the coalescent. In particular, we show that the GF of genealogies can be decomposed into a set of equivalence classes which allows likelihood calculations from non-trivial samples. Using this strategy, we used Mathematica to automate block-wise likelihood calculations based on the GF for a very general set of demographic scenarios that may involve population size changes, continuous migration, discrete divergence and admixture between multiple populations.

Here we show that changes in RNA polymerase fidelity can be measured using standard RNA sequencing protocols. We find that RNA polymerase is error-prone, and these errors can result in splicing defects.

By developing an unbiased modeling approach that performs an iterative search for predictive DNA sequence features using the frequencies of various k-mers, inferred DNA mechanical properties and spatial positions of promoter sequences, we achieved the best performer status in this challenge.

Trees respond to defoliation in many ways; some recover rapidly, while others decline gradually or die. These differences may arise from species functional traits that constrain growth such as xylem anatomy, growth phenology or non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage, but this has not been shown. Although many studies address these phenomena, varied and idiosyncratic measures limit our ability to generalize and predict defoliation responses across species. I synthesized and translated published growth and mortality data into consistent standardized variables suitable for numerical models. I analyzed data from 32 studies, including 16 tree species and 10 defoliator systems from North America and Eurasia, and quantitatively compared responses to defoliation among species and tree functional groups using linear mixed-effects models.

Relative growth decreased linearly or curvilinearly as defoliation stress accumulated across species. Growth decreased by only 5-20% following 100% defoliation in ring-porous Quercus, whereas growth of diffuse-porous hardwoods and conifers declined by 50-100%. Mortality increased exponentially with defoliation, more rapidly for Pinus and diffuse-porous species than for Quercus and Abies. Species-specific mixed models were best (R2c = 0.83-0.94), yet functional-group models lost little in terms of goodness-of-fit (R2c = 0.72-0.92), providing useful alternatives when species data is lacking. These responses are consistent with functional differences in wood growth phenology and NSC storage. Ring-porous spring xylem growth precedes budburst. Defoliators whose damage follows foliar development can only affect development of later wood. Growth of diffuse-porous and coniferous species responds more drastically, yet differences in NSC storage make them more vulnerable to mortality as stress accumulates. Ring-porous species resist defoliation-related changes in growth and mortality more than diffuse-porous and coniferous species. These findings apply in general to disturbances that cause spring defoliation and should be incorporated into forest vegetation models.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Tree Physiology/Tree Physiology1.pdf,"[( 12 Nov 2015 , 8), ( 29 Mar 2017 , 3), ( 30 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 28 Oct 2015 , 2), ( 27 Oct 2015 , 4), ( 18 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

Cone snails within the family, Conidae, comprise more than 700 species of carnivorous marine snails that capture their prey by using a cocktail of venomous neurotoxins (conotoxins or conopeptides). Venom composition across species has been previously hypothesized to be shaped by (a) prey taxonomic class (i.e., worms, molluscs, or fish) and (b) dietary breadth. We tested these hypotheses under a comparative phylogenetic framework using ecological data in conjunction with venom duct transcriptomes sequenced from 12 phylogenetically disparate cone snail species, including 10 vermivores (worm-eating), one molluscivore, and one generalist. We discovered 2223 unique conotoxin precursor peptides that encoded 1864 unique mature toxins across all species, >90% of which are new to this study. In addition, we identified two novel gene superfamilies and 16 novel cysteine frameworks. Each species exhibited unique venom profiles, with venom composition and expression patterns among species dominated by a restricted set of gene superfamilies and mature toxins. In contrast with the dominant paradigm for interpreting Conidae venom evolution, prey taxonomic class did not predict venom composition patterns among species. Our results suggests that cone snails have either evolved species-specific expression patterns likely as a consequence of the rapid evolution of conotoxin genes, or that traditional means of categorizing prey type (i.e., worms, mollusc, or fish) and conotoxins (i.e., by gene superfamily) do not accurately encapsulate evolutionary dynamics between diet and venom composition. We also found a significant positive relationship between dietary breadth and measures of conotoxin complexity. These results indicate that species with more generalized diets tend to have more complex venoms and utilize a greater number of venom genes for prey capture. Whether this increased gene diversity confers an increased capacity for evolutionary change remains to be tested.

Further, we demonstrated that signatures of strong and recent soft sweeps are abundant. However, the extent to which this pattern is specific to this derived and admixed population is unknown. Neither is it clear whether such a pattern may have arisen as a consequence of the extensive inbreeding performed to generate the DGRP data. Here we analyze > 100 fully sequenced strains from Zambia, an ancestral population to the Raleigh population, that has experienced little to no admixture and was generated by sequencing haploid embryos rather than inbred strains. This data set allows us to determine whether patterns of elevated LD and signatures of abundant soft sweeps are generic to multiple populations of D. melanogaster or whether they are generated either by inbreeding, bottlenecks or admixture in the DGRP dataset. We find an elevation in long-range LD and haplotype homozygosity in the Zambian dataset, confirming the result from the DGRP data set. This elevation in LD and haplotype structure remains even after controlling for many sources of LD in the data including genomic inversions, admixture, population substructure, close relatedness of individual strains, and recombination rate variation. Furthermore, signatures of partial soft sweeps similar to those found in the DGRP are common in Zambia.

Although the activity of BEs and DBEs is mandatory to sustain normal starch synthesis, the relative importance of each in the establishment of the plant storage polyglucan (i.e. water-insolubility, crystallinity, presence of amylose) is still debated. Here, we have substituted the activity of BEs in Arabidopsis with that of the Escherichia coli glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB). The latter is the BE counterpart in the metabolism of glycogen, a highly branched water-soluble and amorphous storage polyglucan. GlgB was expressed in the be2 be3 double mutant of Arabidopsis that is devoid of BE activity and consequently free of starch. The synthesis of a water-insoluble, partly crystalline, amylose-containing starch-like polyglucan was restored in GlgB-expressing plants, suggesting that BEs origin only have a limited impact on establishing essential characteristics of starch.

The modelling of such processes calls for the use of exact stochastic simulation methods, most notably the Gillespie algorithm.  However, this stochasticity, also termed “intrinsic noise”, does not account for all the variability between genetically identical cells growing in a homogeneous environment.  Despite substantial experimental efforts, determining appropriate model parameters continues to be a challenge.  Methods based on approximate Bayesian computation can be used to obtain posterior parameter distributions given the observed data.  However, such inference procedures require large numbers of simulations of the model and exact stochastic simulation is computationally costly.  In this work we focus on the specific case of trying to infer model parameters describing reaction rates and extrinsic noise on the basis of measurements of molecule numbers in individual cells at a given time point.

Results:  To make the problem computationally tractable we develop an exact, model-specific, stochastic simulation algorithm for the commonly used two-state model of gene expression.  This algorithm relies on certain assumptions and favourable properties of the model to forgo the simulation of the whole temporal trajectory of protein numbers in the system, instead returning only the number of protein and mRNA molecules present in the system at a specified time point.  The computational gain is proportional to the number of protein molecules created in the system and becomes significant for systems involving hundreds or thousands of protein molecules.  We employ this algorithm, approximate Bayesian computation, and published gene expression data for Escherichia coli to simultaneously infer the model's rate parameters and parameters describing extrinsic noise for 86 genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Systems Biology/BMC Systems Biology4.pdf,"[( 29 Oct 2015 , 4), ( 30 Oct 2015 , 1)]"

One hallmark of mRNAs licensed for translation is the exchange of 7-methylguanosine cap binding proteins. However, mRNAs undergoing steady state translation are also NMD substrates, raising mechanistic questions about the NMD checkpoint. To test the role of cap binding proteins in NMD, we modulated the protein composition of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) with the naturally occurring macrolide rapamycin. We demonstrate that despite well-documented attenuation of cap-dependent mRNA translation, rapamycin can augment NMD. Rapamycin-treatment significantly reduces the levels of endogenous and exogenous PTC-containing mRNA isoforms in a dose- and UPF1- dependent manner. PTC-containing transcripts exhibit a shorter half-life upon rapamacyin-treatment as compared to non-PTC isoforms. Rapamycin also causes depletion of PTC-containing mRNA isoforms from polyribosomes, suggesting that actively translating ribosomes can transition between low and high NMD states.

Key Message   Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform radiata pine shoots and to efficiently produce stable genetically modified pine plants.

Abstract  Micropropagated shoot explants from Pinus radiata D. Don were used to produce stable transgenic plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation.  Using this method any genotype that can be micropropagated could produce stable transgenic lines. As over 80% of P. radiata genotypes tested can be micropropagated, this effectively means that any line chosen for superior characteristics could be transformed. There are well established protocols for progressing such germplasm to field deployment.  Here we used open and control pollinated seed lines and embryogenic clones. The method developed was faster than other methods previously developed using mature cotyledons. PCR positive shoots could be obtain within 6 months of Agrobacterium cocultivation compared with 12 months for cotyledon methods. Transformed shoots were obtained using either kanamycin or geneticin as the selectable marker gene. Shoots were recovered from selection, were tested and were not chimeric, indicating that the selection pressure was optimal for this explant type. GFP was used as a vital marker, and the bar gene, (for resistance to the herbicide Buster®/Basta®) was used to produce lines that could potentially be used in commercial application. As expected, a range of expression phenotypes were identified for both these reporter genes and the analyses for expression were relatively easy.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print835.pdf,"[( 08 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 28 Oct 2015 , 4)]"

We address whether disruption in hybrid seed development is the primary source of reproductive isolation between these sympatric taxa.

M. guttatus and M. nudatus differ in the pattern and timing of endosperm and embryo development. Some hybrid seed exhibit early disruption of endosperm development and are completely inviable, while others develop relatively normally at first, but later exhibit impaired endosperm proliferation and low germination success. These developmental patterns are reflected in mature hybrid seed, which are either small and flat (indicating little to no endosperm), or shriveled (indicating reduced endosperm volume). Hybrid seed inviability forms a potent reproductive barrier between M. guttatus and M. nudatus.

Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on the Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be accurately inferred back from the sequences.

The neural basis of such flexibility requires that groups of distant neural ensembles rapidly alter communications with selectivity and fidelity. Low frequency oscillations are a strong candidate for how neurons coordinate communication via the dynamic instantiation of functional networks. These dynamic networks are argued to rapidly guide the flow of information, with the presumption that stronger oscillations more strongly influence information flow. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence or theoretical support for how oscillatory activity might enhance information flow. Here we introduce a novel computational model for oscillatory neural communication and show that, rather than the strength of the oscillation, it is the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity that has the largest effect on information flow. When coupling an oscillation and spiking has balanced excitatory-inhibitory inputs, information flow is enhanced via improved discriminability between signal and noise. In contrast, when coupling is unbalanced, driven either by excessive excitation or inhibition, information flow is obstructed, regardless of the strength of the oscillation. A multitude of neuropathologies, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and autism, are associated with oscillatory disruptions and excitation-inhibition imbalances.

and disease associations suggest that one or more balancing selection regimes have
acted upon these genes. However, several questions about these selective regimes
remain open. First, it is unclear if stronger evidence for selection on deep timescales is
due to changes in the intensity of selection over time or to a lack of power of most
methods to detect selection on recent timescales. Another question concerns the
functional entities which define the selected phenotype. While most analysis focus on
selection acting on individual alleles, it is also plausible that phylogenetically defined
groups of alleles (“lineages”) are targets of selection. To address these questions we
analyzed how dN/dS (ω) varies
with respect to divergence times between alleles and phylogenetic placement (position
of branches). We find that ω for ARS codons of class I HLA genes increases with
divergence time and is higher for inter-lineage
branches. Throughout our analyses, we used non-selected codons to control for
possible effects of inflation of ω associated to intra-specific analysis, and showed that
our results are not artifactual. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the

We describe herein, a protocol for sub-tomogram averaging from cryo-ET data using the RELION software. We describe how to calculate newly developed three-dimensional models for the contrast transfer function and the missing wedge of each sub-tomogram, and how to use these models for regularized-likelihood refinement. This approach has been implemented in the existing workflow for single-particle analysis, so that users may conveniently tap into existing capabilities of the RELION software. As example applications, we present analyses of purified hepatitis B capsid particles and S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes.

Here we present an application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation as a way to measure similarity between diseases using textual descriptions. We learn latent topic representations of text from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man records and use them to compute similarity.  We assess the performance of this approach by comparing our results to manually curated relationships from the Disease Ontology.   Despite being unsupervised, our model recovers a record's curated Disease Ontology relations  with a mean Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 0.80.  With low dimensional models, topics tend to represent higher level information about affected organ systems, while higher dimensional models capture more granular genetic and phenotypic information.  We examine topic representations of diseases for mapping concepts between ontologies and for tagging existing text with concepts.

Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is the only hexaploid conifer and one of just two naturally polyploid conifer species. Numerous hypotheses about the mechanism of polyploidy in Sequoia and parental genome donors have been proffered over the years, primarily based on morphological and cytological data, but it remains unclear how Sequoia became polyploid and why this lineage overcame an apparent gymnosperm barrier to whole-genome duplication (WGD). We sequenced transcriptomes and used phylogenetic inference, Bayesian concordance analysis, and paralog age distributions to resolve relationships among gene copies in hexaploid coast redwood and its close relatives. Our data show that hexaploidy in the coast redwood lineage is best explained by autopolyploidy or, if there was allopolyploidy, this was restricted to within the Californian redwood clade. We found that duplicate genes have more similar sequences than would be expected given evidence from fossil guard cell size which suggest that polyploidy dates to the Eocene. Conflict between molecular and fossil estimates of WGD can be explained if diploidization occurred very slowly following whole genome duplication. We extrapolate from this to suggest that the rarity of polyploidy in conifers may be due to slow rates of diploidization in this clade.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/New Phytologist/New Phytologist5.pdf,"[( 06 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 10 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 04 Nov 2015 , 11), ( 05 Nov 2015 , 18), ( 16 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 07 Nov 2015 , 5), ( 03 Nov 2015 , 11), ( 11 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 09 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

Recent analysis has revealed that enterocytes in MVID patients exhibit reduction of microvilli, presence of microvillus inclusion bodies and intestinal villus atrophy. Genetic linkage analysis has identified mutations in myosin Vb gene as the main cause of MVID. An animal model that develops ex-utero and is tractable genetically as well as by microscopy would be highly useful to study the cellular basis of the formation of inclusion bodies.
Results: Here we report that the intestine of the zebrafish goosepimples (gsp)/myosin Vb (myoVb) mutant show severe reduction in the intestinal folds- structures similar to mammalian villi. The loss of folds is further correlated with changes in the shape of enterocytes. In a striking similarity with MVID patients, zebrafish gsp/myoVb mutant larvae exhibit microvillus atrophy, microvillus inclusions and accumulation of secretory material in enterocytes. 
Conclusion: We propose that the zebrafish gsp/myoVb mutant is a valuable model to study the pathophysiology of MVID. Owing to the advantages of zebrafish in screening libraries of small molecules, the gsp mutant will be an appropriate tool to identify compounds that would alleviate the formation of microvillus inclusions and have therapeutic value.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Mechanisms of Development/Mechanisms of Development1.pdf,"[( 04 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 03 Nov 2015 , 3)]"

Bioinformatics tools are continuously being developed for the analysis of HTS data. Beyond some well-defined core analyses, such as quality control or genomic alignment, the consistent development of custom tools and the representation of sequencing data in organized computational structures and entities remains a challenging effort for bioinformaticians.

Results: In this work, we present GenOO [jee-noo], an open-source; object-oriented (OO) Perl framework specifically developed for the design and implementation of HTS analysis tools. GenOO models biological entities such as genes and transcripts as Perl objects, and includes relevant modules, attributes and methods that allow for the manipulation of high throughput sequencing data. GenOO integrates these elements in a simple and transparent way which allows for the creation of complex analysis pipelines minimizing the overhead for the researcher. GenOO has been designed with flexibility in mind, and has an easily extendable modular structure with minimal requirements for external tools and libraries. As an example of the framework’s capabilities and usability, we present a short and simple walkthrough of a custom use case in HTS analysis.

Conclusions: GenOO is a tool of high software quality which can be efficiently used for advanced HTS analyses. It has been used to develop several custom analysis tools, leading to a number of published works. Using GenOO as a core development module can greatly benefit users, by reducing the overhead and complexity of managing HTS data and biological entities at hand.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print843.pdf,"[( 03 Nov 2015 , 5), ( 08 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 04 Nov 2015 , 22), ( 13 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 05 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 07 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 14 May 2015 , 3), ( 23 May 2015 , 3), ( 09 Nov 2015 , 7), ( 13 May 2015 , 4), ( 15 May 2015 , 3)]"

We have found that the prolylhydroxylase PHD2 is a critical regulator of the assembly of the kinetochore. PHD2 hydroxylates the kinetochore component CENP-N on P311 and is essential for CENP-N localization to kinetochores. Either depletion of PHD2, or expression of a hydroxylation-deficient mutant, results in loss of the histone H3 variant CENP-A from centromeres. Loss of CENP-N from chromatin bound protein complexes is not due to decreased protein stability but is a consequence of lowered affinity of CENP-N for binding CENP-L.

This flux diversion yields very similar qualitative predictions to prior methods for single target activity.

The processing of this data frequently leads to I/O bottlenecks, e.g. when analyzing a small genomic region across a large number of samples. The largest I/O burden is, however, often not imposed by the amount of data needed for the analysis but rather by index files that help retrieving this data. We have developed chopBAI, a program that can chop a BAM index (BAI) file into small pieces. The program outputs a list of BAI files each indexing a specified genomic interval. The output files are much smaller in size but maintain compatibility with existing software tools. We show how preprocessing BAI files with chopBAI can lead to a reduction of I/O by more than 95 % during the analysis of 10 Kbp genomic regions, eventually enabling the joint analysis of more than 10,000 individuals.

Surprisingly, it is not clear how the diversity in firing patterns of the neurons in a network affects its activity dynamics. Here, we introduce the state-dependent stochastic bursting neuron model allowing for a change in its firing patterns independent of changes in its input-output firing rate relationship. Using this model, we show that the effect of single neuron spiking on the network dynamics is contingent on the network activity state. While spike bursting can both generate and disrupt oscillations, these patterns are ineffective in large regions of the network state space in changing the network activity qualitatively. Finally, we show that when single-neuron properties are made dependent on the population activity, a hysteresis like dynamics emerges. This novel phenomenon has important implications for determining the network response to time-varying inputs and for the network sensitivity at different operating points.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports36.pdf,"[( 06 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 05 Nov 2015 , 3), ( 07 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

In both projects, CC8 and CC30 were the most common S. aureus subtypes encountered.  We found evidence that the subtype composition at different body sites of the same individual were more similar than random sampling and more limited evidence that certain body sites were enriched for particular subtypes.  One surprising finding was the apparent high frequency of CC398, a lineage associated with livestock, in samples from the  tongue dorsum.  Epidemiologic analysis of the HMP subject population suggested that high BMI (body mass index) and health insurance are risk factors for S. aureus but there was limited power to find factors linked to carriage of even the most common subtype. In the NYC subway data, we found a small signal of geographic distance affecting subtype clustering but other unknown factors influence taxonomic distribution of the species around the city.

The circadian system in Arabidopsis thaliana is complex in part due to its photo-transduction pathways. Analysis of natural genetic variation between Arabidopsis accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) identified a major, temperature-specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome V that altered the circadian period of leaf movement (Edwards et al., Genetics, 2005). We tested Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) to confirm that Ler alleles at this PerCv5c QTL lengthened the circadian period at 12°C, with little effect at higher temperatures. The PHYTOCHROME C gene lies within the QTL interval, and contains multiple sequence variants. Plants carrying either a T-DNA-insertion into PHYC or a deletion of PHYC also lengthened circadian period under white light, except at 27°C. phyB and phyABE mutants lengthened period only at 12°C. These results extend recent data showing PhyC effects in red light, confirming the number of photoreceptor proteins implicated in the plant circadian system at eleven. The connection between light input mechanisms and temperature effects on the clock is reinforced. Natural genetic variation within PHYC is likely to underlie the PerCv5c QTL.

Here, we apply flexible machine learning techniques based on sequence features and comparative genomics to quantify the prevalence of sRNA ORFs under natural selection to maintain protein-coding function in phylogenetically diverse bacteria.

This implies that overall at least 7.5 ± 0.3% of sRNAs have a coding ORF, and in some species at least 20% do. 84 ± 9.8 of these novel coding ORFs have some antisense overlap to annotated ORFs. As experimental validation, many of our predictions are translated according to ribosome profiling data and are identified via mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics. B. subtilis sRNAs with coding ORFs are enriched for high expression in biofilms and confluent growth, and two S. pneumoniae sRNAs with coding ORFs are involved in virulence. sRNA coding ORFs are enriched for transmembrane domains and many are novel components of type I toxin/antitoxin systems.

We address these questions investigating a classic example of adaptation by natural selection - the colonization of plant species to heavy metal contaminated soils.  We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance QTL, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment, but are neutral, or nearly so, in the off-mine environment. We assemble the genome of a mine adapted genotype and identify regions of this genome in tight genetic linkage to Tol1. We discover Tol1 candidate genes that exhibit significantly large differences in expression between tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes or in allele frequency between mine/off-mine population pairs. We identify a single gene, a multicopper oxidase, which exhibits both large differences in expression and allele frequency. Furthermore, patterns of genetic variation at the five loci with the greatest difference in allele frequency between populations, including the multicopper oxidase, are consistent with selection acting upon beneficial haplotypes that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. We estimate the age of selected Tol1 haplotype to be at least 1700 years old and was at a frequency of 0.4-0.6% in the ancestral population when mining was initiated 150 years ago.

To address this issue, we analyzed dosage compensation in the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae) using tissues that represent different levels of sexual divergence.

We based our analyses on RNAseq and de novo transcriptome data from C. pomonella, as well as scrutiny into investigations of other lepidopteran species. Our evidence supports that the lepidopterans share a pattern (Z≈ZZ<AA) of dosage compensation that mirrors the eutherian mammals (X≈XX<AA). In particular, reproductive tissues appear to be exempt from dosage compensation, which helps explain the incongruence in prior reports. Furthermore, C. pomonella ancestral-Z segment exhibited a greater expression reduction than genes on the neo-Z segment, which intriguingly also reflects the differential up-regulation between the ancestral and newly-acquired X-linked genes in mammals.

Background
Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has emerged globally as the most predominant lineage within this clinically important species, and its association with fluoroquinolone and extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance impacts significantly on treatment. The evolutionary histories of this lineage, and of important antimicrobial resistance elements within it, remain unclearly defined. 
Results
This study of the largest worldwide collection (n = 215) of sequenced ST131 E. coli isolates to date demonstrates that clonal expansion of two previously recognized antimicrobial-resistant clades, C1/H30R and C2/H30Rx, started around 25 years ago, consistent with the widespread introduction of fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins in clinical medicine. These two clades appear to have emerged in the United States, with the expansion of the C2/H30Rx clade driven by the acquisition of a blaCTX-M-15-containing IncFII-like plasmid that has subsequently undergone extensive rearrangement. Several other evolutionary processes influencing the trajectory of this drug-resistant lineage are described, including sporadic acquisitions of CTX-M resistance plasmids, and chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M within sub-clusters followed by vertical evolution. These processes are also occurring for another family of CTX-M gene variants more recently observed amongst ST131, the blaCTX-M-14/14-like group. 
Conclusions
The complexity of the evolutionary history of ST131 has important implications for antimicrobial resistance surveillance, epidemiological analysis, and control of emerging clinical lineages of E. coli. These data also highlight the global imperative to reduce specific antibiotic selection pressures, and demonstrate the important and varied roles played by plasmids and other mobile genetic elements in the perpetuation of antimicrobial resistance within lineages.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/mBio/mBio2.pdf,"[( 09 Nov 2015 , 7), ( 06 Nov 2015 , 5), ( 18 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 11 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 07 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

While the collapse of incipient species is theoretically common, very few examples have been documented in nature.  Here I show that soapberry bugs (Jadera haematoloma) have lost adaptations to their native host plant (Cardiospermum corindum) and are regionally specializing on an invasive host plant (Koelreuteria elegans), collapsing a classic and well-documented example of local adaptation.

The present study examines patterns of transcriptome-wide response to 1,25D and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to better understand the pathways underlying the effects of 1,25D on the immune system. Monocytes obtained from healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry were treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS, which induced significant up-regulation of genes in the antimicrobial and autophagy pathways, while pro-inflammatory response genes were significantly down-regulated. A joint Bayesian analysis enabled clustering of genes into patterns of shared transcriptional response across treatments. The biological pathways enriched within these expression patterns highlighted several mechanisms through which could 1,25D exert its immunomodulatory role. Pathways such as mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and Tec Kinase signaling were enriched among genes with opposite transcription responses to 1,25D and LPS, highlighting the important roles of these pathways in mediating the immunomodulatory activity of 1,25D. Furthermore, a subset of genes with evidence of inter-ethnic differential expression patterns was also identified, indicating that in addition to the well established inter-ethnic variation in circulating levels of vitamin D, the intensity of transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS also varies between ethnic groups. Dysregulation of the pathways identified in this study through variations in transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS could contribute to disease risk.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics29.pdf,"[( 06 Nov 2015 , 5)]"

Such studies require accurate characterization of clusters, both for absolute quantification and hypothesis testing. A set of model-free quantification approaches - free of specific cluster models- including the radius of maximal aggregation ra obtained from the maxima of the L(r)-r function as an estimator of cluster size, and the estimation of various cluster parameters based on an exponential approximation for the Pair Correlation Function (PCF), have been proposed for this purpose. However, the parameter identifiability and bias due to their model-free nature are not clear. In practice, the clusters might exhibit specific patterns, and the behavior of these estimators in such cases must be studied. Here, we theoretically analyze these approaches for a

of cluster models, and obtain information about their identifiability and bias. We find that the ratio between ra and true size depends on both the true size as well as the number of clusters per unit area, or other corresponding parameters, in a model-dependent manner. In particular, ra scales with respect to the true size by a factor that can be arbitrarily large. For the method using PCF approximation, for most models we analyzed, the ratios between approximate and true model parameters were found to be constants that depend only on models and independent of other parameters, and the ratios were found to be within 100% of the true parameters. We also discuss some general issues in inference using second-order spatial properties.

However, most population genetic inference methods ignore population structure and reconstruct a history characterized by population size changes under the assumption that species behave as panmictic units. This is potentially problematic since population structure can generate spurious signals of population size change. Moreover, when the model assumed for demographic inference is misspecified,  genomic data will likely increase the precision of misleading if not meaningless parameters. In a context of model uncertainty (panmixia \textit{versus} structure) genomic data may thus not necessarily lead to improved statistical inference.

We consider two haploid genomes and develop a theory which explains why any demographic model (with or without population size changes) will necessarily be interpreted as a series of changes in population size by inference methods ignoring structure. We introduce a new parameter, the IICR (inverse instantaneous coalescence rate), and show that it is equivalent to a population size only in panmictic models, and mostly misleading for structured models. We argue that this general issue affects all population genetics methods ignoring population structure. We take the PSMC method as an example and show that it infers population size changes that never took place.

Sequence variants from key ancestors can be imputed in animals that have been genotyped using medium- and high-density genotyping arrays. Association analysis with imputed sequences, particularly if applied to multiple traits simultaneously, is a very powerful approach to revealing candidate causal variants underlying complex phenotypes.
Results: We used whole-genome sequence data from 157 key ancestors of the German Fleckvieh population to impute 20 561 798 sequence variants in 10 363 animals that had (partly imputed) array-derived genotypes at 634 109 SNP. The imputed sequence data were enriched for rare variants. Association studies with imputed sequence variants were performed using seven correlated udder conformation traits as response variables. The calculation of an approximate multi-trait test statistic enabled us to detect twelve major QTL (P<2.97 x 10-9) controlling different aspects of mammary gland morphology. Imputed sequence variants were the most significantly associated at eleven QTL, whereas the top association signal at a QTL on BTA14 resulted from an array-derived variant. Seven QTL were associated with multiple phenotypes. Most QTL were located in non-coding regions of the genome in close neighborhood, however, to plausible candidate genes for mammary gland morphology (SP5, GC, NPFFR2, CRIM1, RXFP2, TBX5, RBM19, ADAM12).
Conclusions: Association analysis with imputed sequence variants allows QTL characterization at maximum resolution. Multi-trait approaches can reveal QTL that are not detected in single-trait association studies. Most QTL for udder conformation traits were located in non-coding elements of the genome suggesting regulatory mutations to be the major determinants of variation in mammary gland morphology in cattle.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics Selection Evolution/Genetics Selection Evolution1.pdf,"[( 09 Nov 2015 , 5)]"

Until now, efforts have focused on taxon sampling (e.g., by including a handful of genes in many species) or on maximizing matrix occupancy (e.g., by including hundreds or thousands of genes in just a few species), but a phylogeny maximizing sampling at both levels remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed forty Illumina transcriptomes representing three myriapod classes (Diplopoda, Chilopoda and Symphyla); twenty-five transcriptomes were newly sequenced to maximize representation at the ordinal level in Diplopoda and at the family level in Chilopoda. Eight supermatrices were constructed to explore the effect of several potential phylogenetic biases (e.g., rate of evolution, heterotachy) at three levels of mean gene occupancy per taxon (50%, 75% and 90%). Analyses based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian mixture models retrieved monophyly of each myriapod class, and resulted in two alternative phylogenetic positions for Symphyla, as sister group to Diplopoda + Chilopoda, or closer to Diplopoda, the latter hypothesis having been traditionally supported by morphology. Within centipedes, all orders were well supported, but two nodes remained in conflict in the different analyses despite dense taxon sampling at the family level, situating the order Scolopendromorpha as sister group to a morphologically-anomalous grouping of Lithobiomorpha + Geophilomorpha in a subset of analyses. Interestingly, this anomalous result was obtained for all analyses conducted with the most complete matrix (90% of occupancy), being at odds not only with the sparser but more gene-rich supermatrices (75% and 50% supermatrices) or with the matrices optimizing phylogenegic informativeness and the most conserved genes, but also with previous hypotheses based on morphology, development or other molecular data sets.

Then we studied the lipidomics of E18.5 placenta and E14.5 placenta. The IVF group has an eccentric lipid content compared to in vivo group.

To the imprinted genes for lipid metabolism regulation as GNAS and Grb10, IVF not only disrupt their imprinting status (methylation level) but also disrupt their gene expression.

Bayesian inference on mortality for the dispersing sex,Ecology and Evolution,"[(Barthold, Julia A,  University of Southern Denmark), (Packer, Craig,  University of Minnesota), (Loveridge, Andrew J,  University of Oxford), (Macdonald, David W,  University of Oxford), (Colchero, Fernando,  University of Southern Denmark)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/031161 ,"1. Estimates of age-specific mortality are regularly used in ecology, evolution, and conservation research. However, existing methods to estimate mortality from re-sighting records of marked individuals fail at estimating mortality of males for species with male natal dispersal due to the uncertainty surrounding disappearances of adult males from study populations.
2. Here, we develop a mortality model that imputes dispersal state (i.e., died or left) for uncertain male records as a latent state jointly with the coefficients of a parametric mortality model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. To check the performance of our model, we first conduct a simulation study. We then apply our model to a long-term data set for African lions. Using these data, we further scrutinise the mortality estimates derived from our model by incrementally reducing the level of uncertainty in the male records. We achieve this by taking advantage of an expert's intuition on the likely fate of each uncertain male record.
3. We find that our new model produces accurate mortality parameters for simulated data of varying sample sizes and proportions of uncertain male records. From the empirical study we learned that our model provides similar mortality estimates for different levels of uncertainty in male records. However, a sensitivity of the mortality estimates to varying uncertainty is, as can be expected, detectable.
4. We conclude that our model provides a solution to the challenge of estimating male mortality in species with data-deficiency for males due to natal dispersal. Given the utility of sex-specific mortality estimates in biological and conservation research and the virtual ubiquity of sex-biased dispersal, our model will be useful to a wide variety of applications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Ecology and Evolution/Ecology and Evolution4.pdf,"[( 10 Nov 2015 , 4), ( 11 Nov 2015 , 2)]"

However, while the brain is processing moving objects, these have already moved to new locations.

Although many psychophysical models have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, their predictions have not been tested at the neural level, particularly in animals that are known to perceive the illusion. To address this, we recorded neural responses to flashed and moving bars from primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, fixating monkeys. We found that the response latency for moving bars was shorter than that of flashes, in a manner that is consistent with psychophysical results from humans and monkeys. At the level of V1, our results support the differential latency model of the flash lag effect and suggest that an active position judgment - as predicted by the postdiction/motion-biasing model - may not be necessary for observing a neural correlate of the illusion.

Background
Cellular senescence has historically been viewed as an irreversible cell cycle arrest that acts to prevent cancer. Recent discoveries demonstrated that cellular senescence also played a vital role in normal embryonic development, tissue renewal and senescence-related diseases. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is an important layer of post-transcriptional regulation, which has been found playing an essential role in development, activation of immune cells and cancer progression. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains unclear. 
Materials and Methods
We applied high-throughput paired-end polyadenylation sequencing (PA-seq) and strand-specific RNA-seq sequencing technologies, combined systematic bioinformatics analyses and experimental validation to investigate APA regulation in different passages of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells of rats (VSMCs) with different ages.
Results
Based on PA-seq, we found that genes in senescent cells tended to use distal pA sites and an independent bioinformatics analysis for RNA-seq drew the same conclusion. In consistent with these global results, both the number of genes significantly preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MEFs and VSMCs were significantly higher than genes tended to use proximal pAs. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs tended to decrease, while genes with single pAs did not show such trend. More importantly, genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs were both enriched in common senescence-related pathways, including ubiqutin mediated proteolysis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle and wnt signaling pathway. By cis-elements analyses, we found that the longer 3'UTR; UTRs of the genes tended to use distal pAs progressively can introduce more conserved binding sites of senescence-related miRNAs and RBPs. Furthermore, 375 genes with progressive 3'UTR; UTR lengthening during MEF senescence tended to use more strong and conserved polyadenylation signal (PAS) around distal pA sites and this was accompanied the observation that expression level of core factors involved in cleavage and polyadenylation complex was decreased.
Conclusions
Our finding that genes preferred distal pAs in senescent mouse and rat cells provide new insights for aging cells' posttranscriptional gene regulation in the view of alternative polyadenylation given senescence response was thought to be a tumor suppression mechanism and more genes tended to use proximal pAs in cancer cells. In short, APA was a hidden layer of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation involved in cellular senescence.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print868.pdf,"[( 12 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 11 Nov 2015 , 3)]"

Evidence suggests that environmental factors and host genetics may interact to impact human microbiome composition. Identifying host genetic variants associated with human microbiome composition not only provides clues for characterizing microbiome variation but also helps to elucidate biological mechanisms of genetic associations, prioritize genetic variants, and improve genetic risk prediction. Since a microbiota functions as a community, it is best characterized by beta diversity, that is, a pairwise distance matrix. We develop a statistical framework and a computationally efficient software package, microbiomeGWAS, for identifying host genetic variants associated with microbiome beta diversity with or without interacting with an environmental factor. We show that score statistics have positive skewness and kurtosis due to the dependent nature of the pairwise data, which makes P-value approximations based on asymptotic distributions unacceptably liberal. By correcting for skewness and kurtosis, we develop accurate P-value approximations, whose accuracy was verified by extensive simulations. We exemplify our methods by analyzing a set of 147 genotyped subjects with 16S rRNA microbiome profiles from non-malignant lung tissues. Correcting for skewness and kurtosis eliminated the dramatic deviation in the quantile-quantile plots. We provided preliminary evidence that six established lung cancer risk SNPs were collectively associated with microbiome composition for both unweighted (P=0.0032) and weighted (P=0.011) UniFrac distance matrices.

As leaves are the primary photosynthetic organ in plants, many have proposed that leaf physiology, biochemistry, and anatomical structure are coordinated along a functional trait spectrum from fast, resource-acquisitive syndromes to slow, resource-conservative syndromes. However, the coordination hypothesis has rarely been tested at a phylogenetic scale most relevant for understanding rapid adaptation in the recent past or predicting evolutionary trajectories in response to climate change. To that end, we used a common garden to examine genetically-based coordination between leaf traits across 19 wild and cultivated tomato taxa. We found surprisingly weak integration between photosynthetic rate, leaf structure, biochemical capacity, and CO2 diffusion, even though all were arrayed in the predicted direction along a 'fast-slow' spectrum. This suggests considerable scope for unique trait combinations to evolve in response to new environments or in crop breeding. In particular, we find that partially independent variation in stomatal and mesophyll conductance may allow a plant to improve water-use efficiency without necessarily sacrificing maximum photosynthetic rates.

Here, we test an alternative approach that directly uses transcript sequences for probe design, which are often composed of multiple exons of varying lengths. Based on a selection of 1,260 orthologous transcripts, we conducted sequence captures across multiple phylogenetic scales for frogs, including species up to ~100 million years divergent from the focal group. After several conservative filtering steps, we recovered a large phylogenomic data set consisting of sequence alignments for 1,047 of the 1,260 transcriptome-based loci (~630,000 bp) and a large quantity of highly variable regions flanking the exons in transcripts (~70,000 bp).

Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: 1) identifying truly noncoding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and 2) prioritizing hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs from each sample for downstream experimental interrogation.  
RESULTS: We present slncky, a computational lncRNA discovery tool that produces a high-quality set of lncRNAs from RNA-Sequencing data and further prioritizes lncRNAs by characterizing selective constraint as a proxy for function.  Our filtering pipeline is comparable to manual curation efforts and more sensitive than previously published approaches. Further, we develop, for the first time, a sensitive alignment pipeline for aligning lncRNA loci and propose new evolutionary metrics relevant for both sequence and transcript evolution.

While prior studies have emphasized protein coding variants, non-coding sequence variants have also been proven to significantly contribute to high penetrance disorders, such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). We present a strategy for analyzing different functional classes of non-coding variants based on information theory (IT).
Methods: We captured and enriched for coding and non-coding variants in genes known to harbor mutations that increase HBOC risk. Custom oligonucleotide baits spanning the complete coding, non-coding, and intergenic regions 10 kb up- and downstream of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, and TP53 were synthesized for solution hybridization enrichment. Unique and divergent repetitive sequences were sequenced in 102 high-risk patients without identified mutations in BRCA1/2. Aside from protein coding changes, IT-based sequence analysis was used to identify and prioritize pathogenic non-coding variants that occurred within sequence elements predicted to be recognized by proteins or protein complexes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and untranslated region (UTR) binding and structure. This approach was supplemented by in silico and laboratory analysis of UTR structure.
Results: 15,311 unique variants were identified, of which 245 occurred in coding regions. With the unified IT-framework, 132 variants were identified and 87 functionally significant VUS were further prioritized.

However, this entails paying the costs of both dispersal and non-dispersal. Propagules that disperse are likely to encounter unfavorable conditions for establishment, while non-dispersing propagules might form populations of close relatives burdened with inbreeding. Here, we investigate the conditions under which mixed dispersal syndromes emerge and are evolutionarily stable, taking into account the risks of both environmental unpredictability and inbreeding. Using mathematical and computational modeling we show that high dispersal propensity is favored whenever temporal environmental unpredictability is low and inbreeding depression high, whereas mixed dispersal syndromes are adaptive under conditions of high environmental unpredictability, but more particularly if also inbreeding depression is small. Although pure dispersers can be selected for under some circumstances, mixed dispersal provides the optimal strategy under most parameterizations of our models, indicating that this strategy is likely to be favored under a wide variety of conditions. Furthermore, populations exhibiting any single phenotype go inevitably extinct when environmental and genetic costs are high, whilst mixed strategies can maintain viable populations even under such conditions. Our models support the hypothesis that the interplay between inbreeding depression and environmental unpredictability shapes dispersal syndromes, often resulting in mixed strategies. Moreover, mixed dispersal seems to facilitate persistence whenever conditions are critical or nearly critical for survival.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Evolutionary Biology/BMC Evolutionary Biology6.pdf,"[( 12 Nov 2015 , 3), ( 13 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

First, there are minor indexing mistakes in the dynamic programming algorithm which become apparent immediately when implementing the procedure. Hence, we report on these for the sake of completeness.  Second, there is a more profound problem with the dynamic programming matrix initialization. This initialization issue can easily be missed and find its way into actual implementations. This error is also present in standard text books. Namely, the widely used books by Gusfield and Waterman. To obtain an initial estimate of the extent to which this error has been propagated, we scrutinized freely available undergraduate lecture slides. We found that 8 out of 31 lecture slides contained the mistake, while 16 out of 31 simply omit parts of the initialization, thus giving an incomplete description of the algorithm. Finally, by inspecting ten source codes and running respective tests, we found that five implementations were incorrect. Note that, not all bugs we identified are due to the mistake in Gotoh's paper.  Three implementations rely on additional constraints that limit generality.  Thus, only two out of ten yield correct results. We show that the error introduced by Gotoh is straightforward to resolve and provide a correct open-source reference implementation.

Studies have found that neutral polymorphism is reduced close to genes and in regions of low recombination, suggesting the effects of natural selection. However, the effect of selection on neutral sequence divergence between species remains ambiguous. While studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, theoretical arguments suggest selection may not affect divergence at linked neutral sites. Here we address these outstanding issues by examining how natural selection has affected divergence between distantly related species. We show that neutral divergence is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist even when comparing humans and mice, species that split 75 million years ago. Further, neutral divergence is positively correlated with recombination rate. The correlation increases when focusing on genic regions, and biased gene conversion cannot explain all of this correlation. These signatures suggest that natural selection has affected linked divergence between distantly related species. Coalescent models indicate that background selection can generate these patterns. Even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome. Thus, the view that selection does not affect divergence at linked neutral sites needs to be reconsidered.

In this way we expose and quantify the generative rules that shape part of fruit fly locomotor behavior, bringing about a gradual buildup of freedom during the transition from immobility to normal behavior and a precisely opposite narrowing down during the transition into immobility. During buildup the fly exhibits enhancement and then reduction to normal values of movement along each degree of freedom: first, body rotation in the horizontal plane, then path curvature and then speed of translation. Transition into immobility unfolds by narrowing down of the repertoire in the opposite sequential order, showing reciprocal relations during both buildup and narrowing down. The same generative rules apply to vertebrate locomotor behavior in a variety of contexts involving transition out and into immobility. Recent claims for deep homology between the arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia provide an opportunity to examine whether the generative rules we discovered also share common descent.

Recently, our group has taken advantage of the ability to limit insulin secretion in vivo by reducing insulin gene dosage to demonstrate that insulin hypersecretion is a requirement for diet-induced obesity. Our previous studies employed male Ins1+/-:Ins2-/- mice that exhibit a complete inhibition of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia relative to Ins1+/+:Ins2-/- littermate controls, as well as female Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice with transient, partial reduction in circulating insulin relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates. In the present study, we sought to extend these studies to male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice on the same chow and high fat diets. Surprisingly, while reduced Ins2 gene dosage appeared capable of reducing Ins2 mRNA, insulin protein levels in these mice were not significantly reduced. Moreover, there was a marked hyper-variability in circulating insulin levels within and between two independent cohorts of mice that persisted over at least the first year of life. In Cohort 1, we observed a paradoxical increase in body weight in some high fat-fed male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermate controls. This phenomenon is consistent with the known satiety effects of insulin and our previous observations with Ins2 can be expressed in the brain. Collectively, our data reveal unexpected complexity associated with the Ins2 gene in male mice, and establish the Ins2 gene as a candidate for studying the effects of modifier genes and/or environmental influences on gene-to-phenotype variability.

While it may be reasonable to assume that population structure patterns are similar genome-wide in relatively homogeneous populations, this assumption may not be appropriate for admixed populations, such as Hispanics and African Americans, with recent ancestry from two or more continents. Recent studies have suggested that systematic ancestry differences can arise at genomic locations in admixed populations as a result of selection and non-random mating.   Here, we propose a method, which we refer to as the chromosomal ancestry differences (CAnD) test, for detecting heterogeneity in population structure across the genome.  CAnD uses local ancestry inferred from SNP genotype data to identify chromosomes harboring genomic regions with ancestry contributions that are significantly different than expected. In simulation studies with real genotype data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate the validity and power of CAnD. We apply CAnD to the HapMap Mexican American (MXL) and African American (ASW) population samples; in this analysis the software RFMix is used to infer local ancestry at genomic regions assuming admixing from Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans. The CAnD test provides strong evidence of heterogeneity in population structure across the genome in the MXL sample ($p=4e-05$), which is largely driven by elevated Native American ancestry and deficit of European ancestry on the X chromosomes.

All climbing animals use shear forces to switch rapidly between firm attachment and easy detachment, but the detailed mechanisms underlying `shear-sensitive adhesion' have remained unclear. Here, we show that attachment forces of stick insects follow classic peeling theory when shear forces are small, but strongly exceed predictions as soon as their pads start to slide due to high shear forces. Pad sliding dramatically increases the critical peel force via a combination of two distinct mechanisms. First, partial sliding will pre-stretch the pads, so that they are effectively stiffer upon detachment and peel increasingly like inextensible tape. We demonstrate how this effect can be directly related to peeling theories which account for frictional dissipation. Second, pad sliding reduces the thickness of the secretion layer in the contact zone, thereby decreasing the interfacial mobility, and increasing the stress levels required for peeling. The approximately linear increase of adhesion with friction results in a sharp increase of adhesion at peel angles less than ca. 30°, allowing rapid switching between attachment and detachment during locomotion. Our results may apply to diverse climbing animals independent of pad morphology and adhesive mechanism, and highlight that control of adhesion is not solely achieved by direction-dependence and morphological anisotropy, suggesting promising new routes for the development of bio-inspired adhesives.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of the Royal Society Interface/Journal of the Royal Society Interface14.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2015 , 4)]"

To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and empirical approaches, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. We demonstrate considerable latitudinal quantitative genetic divergence in life-history traits in T. urticae, that was shaped by both spatial selection and local adaptation. The former mainly affected dispersal behavior, while development was mainly shaped by adaptation to the local climate. Divergence in life-history traits in species shifting their range poleward can consequently be jointly determined by fast local adaptation to the environmental gradient and contemporary evolutionary dynamics resulting from spatial selection.

Scaffolding is a crucial step in the genome assembly process. Current methods based on large fragment paired-end reads or long reads allow an increase in continuity but often lack consistency in repetitive regions, resulting in fragmented assemblies. Here, we describe a novel tool to link assemblies to a genome map to aid complex genome reconstruction by detecting assembly errors and allowing scaffold ordering and anchoring. 
Results
We present MaGuS (map-guided scaffolding), a modular tool that uses a draft genome assembly, a genome map, and high-throughput paired-end sequencing data to estimate the quality and to enhance the continuity of an assembly. We generated several assemblies of the Arabidopsis genome using different scaffolding programs and applied MaGuS to select the best assembly using quality metrics. Then, we used MaGuS to perform map-guided scaffolding to increase continuity by creating new scaffold links in low-covered and highly repetitive regions where other commonly used scaffolding methods lack consistency.

However, when testing the association between rare variants and traits of interest, the current practice of first calling underlying genotypes and then treating the called values as known is prone to false positive findings, especially when genotyping errors are systematically different between cases and controls. This happens whenever cases and controls are sequenced at different depths or on different platforms. In this article, we provide a likelihood-based approach to testing rare variant associations that directly models sequencing reads without calling genotypes. We consider the (weighted) burden test statistic, which is the (weighted) sum of the score statistic for assessing effects of individual variants on the trait of interest. Because variant locations are unknown, we develop a simple, computationally efficient screening algorithm to estimate the loci that are variants. Because our burden statistic may not have mean zero after screening, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for assessing the significance of the burden statistic. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that the proposed tests are robust to a wide range of differential sequencing qualities between cases and controls, and are at least as powerful as the standard genotype calling approach when the latter controls type I error.

Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects terrestrial inputs on aquatic microbial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active microbial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies microbial community stability through functional not structural changes.

Using hierarchical modeling, our approach embeds a rigorous enrichment analysis to quantify the enrichment level of each annotation in target QTLs. This enrichment information is then used to identify QTLs by up-weighting the genetic variants with relevant annotations using a Bayesian false discovery rate control procedure. Our proposed method only requires summary-level statistics and is highly efficient computationally: it runs a few hundreds times faster than the current gold-standard QTL discovery approach that relies on permutations. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method performs accurate enrichment analysis and controls the desired type I error rate while greatly improving the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations.

Plant meristems are analogous to animal stem cell niches as they maintain a pool of undifferentiated cells that divide and differentiate to give rise to organs. The carpel margin meristem is a vital, multi-potent structure located in the medial domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana gynoecium, the female floral reproductive organ. The carpel margin meristem generates ovules that upon fertilization become seeds. The molecular mechanisms that specify this meristematic region and regulate its organogenic potential are poorly understood. Here, we present an analysis of the transcriptional profile of the medial domain of the Arabidopsis gynoecium highlighting the developmental stages that immediately proceed ovule initiation, the earliest stages of seed development. 

Results 
Using a floral synchronization system and a SHATTERPROOF2 domain-specific reporter, paired with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing, we assayed the transcriptome of the gynoecial medial domain with temporal and spatial precision. This analysis reveals a set of genes that are differentially expressed within the SHATTERPROOF2 expression domain that marks portions of the developing medial domain. Many members of this gene set have been shown previously to function during the development of medial domain-derived structures, including the ovules, thus validating our approach. Other uncharacterized members including differentially expressed cis-natural antisense transcripts, are potential novel regulators of medial domain development. Members of the REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM (REM) family of transcriptional regulators were enriched in the SHATTERPROOF2-expressing cell population including a previously unrecognized REM family member. Finally, the analysis transcriptional isoforms in the medial domain identified genes that may exhibit 'isoform switching' behavior during gynoecial development.

Conclusions
This data set provides genome-wide transcriptional insight into the development of the gynoecial medial domain that contains the carpel margin meristem, a vital reproductive structure that gives rise to the ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Plant Physiology/Plant Physiology3.pdf,"[( 19 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 19 Nov 2015 , 7)]"

Expression of constitutive mutant of Gal3p or over-expression of wild-type Gal3p activates the GAL switch in the absence of galactose. These data suggest that Gal3p exists as an ensemble of active and inactive conformations. Structural data has indicated that Gal3p exists in open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations. However, mutant of Gal3p that predominantly exists in inactive conformation and yet capable of responding to galactose has not been isolated. To understand the mechanism of allosteric transition, we have isolated a triple mutant of Gal3p with V273I, T404A and N450D substitutions which upon over-expression fails to activate the GAL switch on its own, but activates the switch in response to galactose. Over-expression of Gal3p mutants with single or double mutations in any of the three combinations failed to exhibit the behavior of the triple mutant. Molecular dynamics analysis of the wild-type and the triple mutant along with two previously reported constitutive mutants suggests that the wild-type Gal3p may also exist in super-open conformation. Further, our results suggest that the dynamics of residue F237 situated in the hydrophobic pocket located in the hinge region drives the transition between different conformations.

The study used a new approach for low coverage data sets to which tools such as mapDamage cannot be applied to infer chemical damage patterns. Here we show from the analysis of 148 palaeogenomic data sets that the rate of cytosine deamination is a thermally correlated process, and that organellar generally shows higher rates of deamination than nuclear DNA in comparable environments. We categorize four clusters of deamination rates (alpha,beta,gamma,epsilon) that are associated with cold stable environments, cool but thermally fluctuating environments, and progressively warmer environments. These correlations show that the expected level of deamination in the sedaDNA would be extremely low. The low coverage approach to detect DNA damage by Weiss et al. (2) fails to identify damage samples from the cold class of deamination rates. Finally, different enzymes used in library preparation processes exhibit varying capability in reporting cytosine deamination damage in the 5 prime region of fragments. The PCR enzyme used in the sedaDNA study would not have had the capability to report 5 prime cytosine deamination, as they do not read over uracil residues, and signatures of damage would have better been sought at the 3 prime end.

important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism
cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference
methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space
of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori
information on gene interactions.

Methods: Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of
edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete
variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between
groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a
priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach
popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred
regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context
Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3,
winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge.

Results: Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in
silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli
compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to
GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48
additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision.

However, this method is most sensitive to recent selection and may miss selective events that happened a long time ago. To overcome this, we developed an extension of XP-CLR that jointly models the behavior of a selected allele in a three-population tree. Our method - called 3P-CLR - outperforms XP-CLR when testing for selection that occurred before two populations split from each other, and can distinguish between those events and events that occurred specifically in each of the populations after the split. We applied our new test to population genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, to search for selective sweeps that occurred before the split of Yoruba and Eurasians, but after their split from Neanderthals, and that could have led to the spread of modern-human-specific phenotypes. We also searched for sweep events that occurred in East Asians, Europeans and the ancestors of both populations, after their split from Yoruba.

These rich datasets afford deep insights into the nature and extent of genetic contributions to complex phenotypes such as psychiatric disorders, which are understood to have substantial genetic components that arise from very large numbers of SNPs. The complexity of the datasets, however, poses a significant challenge to maximizing their utility. This is reflected in a need for better understanding the landscape of z-scores, as such knowledge would enhance causal SNP and gene discovery, help elucidate mechanistic pathways, and inform future study design. Here we present a parsimonious methodology for modeling effect sizes and replication probabilities that does not require raw genotype data, relying only on summary statistics from GWAS substudies, and a scheme allowing for direct empirical validation. We show that modeling z-scores as a mixture of Gaussians is conceptually appropriate, in particular taking into account ubiquitous non-null effects that are likely in the datasets due to weak linkage disequilibrium with causal SNPs. The four-parameter model allows for estimating the degree of polygenicity of the phenotype -- the proportion of SNPs (after uniform pruning, so that large LD blocks are not over-represented) likely to be in strong LD with causal/mechanistically associated SNPs -- and predicting the proportion of chip heritability explainable by genome wide significant SNPs in future studies with larger sample sizes. We apply the model to recent GWAS of schizophrenia (N=82,315) and additionally, for purposes of illustration, putamen volume (N=12,596), with approximately 9.3 million SNP z-scores in both cases. We show that, over a broad range of z-scores and sample sizes, the model accurately predicts expectation estimates of true effect sizes and replication probabilities in multistage GWAS designs. We estimate the degree to which effect sizes are over-estimated when based on linear regression association coefficients. We estimate the polygenicity of schizophrenia to be 0.037 and the putamen to be 0.001, while the respective sample sizes required to approach fully explaining the chip heritability are 106 and 105.

Here we present a procedure to perform in silico extractions from genomes and create directly comparable datasets for each class of marker.

Furthermore, we were also able to directly compare these results to previously published datasets from Sanger-sequenced nuclear exons and mitochondrial genomes under the same analytical conditions. Our results show---although with the exception of the mitochondrial genome and ddRADseq datasets---that for uncontroversial nodes all data classes performed equally well, i.e. they recovered the same well supported topology. However, for one difficult-to-resolve node comprising a rapid diversification (subfamilial relationships among the Cebidae), we report well supported but conflicting topologies among the marker classes, likely the result of mismodelling of gene tree heterogeneity. Likewise, clade age estimates showed consistent discrepancies between datasets; for recent nodes, clade ages estimated by nuclear exon datasets were younger than those of the UCE, RAD and mitochondrial data, but vice versa for the deepest nodes in the primate phylogeny. This effect can be explained by temporal differences in phylogenetic informativeness and choice of clock model used.

Nevertheless, a characteristic gene expression signature in postmortem cortex is shared across most ASD cases. Knowing whether this signature reflects changes in cells of particular types would help to determine the molecular, cellular, and anatomical etiology of ASD. To investigate we took advantage of cell type marker genes defined by recent single cell transcriptome sequencing from mouse or human cortex. We find that microglial markers showed significantly and substantially higher median expression in postmortem ASD than in control cortex for both mouse and human markers (21% higher for orthologous markers defined in mouse; 93% higher for human markers). In contrast, neuronal markers showed reduced median expression: 12% and 16% lower for mouse interneurons and pyramidal neurons, 40% lower for human neurons, and 36% lower for a class of human excitatory projection neurons. Cell type density alterations in ASD brains are indicated because distributions of these cell type markers are shifted concordantly. Importantly, orthologous mouse neuronal marker genes encoding proteins localized to diverse neuronal compartments all showed reduced median expression in ASD. Our results provide a framework for revealing the basis of transcriptomic differences in ASD.

These two systemic responses to damage are both mediated by Dilp8, a member of the insulin/IGF/relaxin family of peptide hormones, which is released by regenerating imaginal discs. Growth coordination between regenerating and undamaged imaginal discs is dependent on Dilp8 activation of NOS in the prothoracic gland (PG), which slows the growth of undamaged discs by limiting ecdysone synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila relaxin receptor homologue Lgr3, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor, is required for Dilp8-dependent growth coordination and developmental delay during the regeneration checkpoint. Lgr3 regulates these responses to damage via distinct mechanisms in different tissues. Using tissue-specific RNAi disruption of Lgr3 expression, we show that Lgr3 functions in the PG upstream of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and is necessary for NOS activation and growth coordination during the regeneration checkpoint. When Lgr3 is depleted from neurons, imaginal disc damage no longer produces either developmental delay or growth inhibition. To reconcile these discrete tissue requirements for Lgr3 during regenerative growth coordination, we demonstrate that Lgr3 activity in the both the CNS and PG is necessary for NOS activation in the PG following damage.

We report here that the white (w) gene modulates the timing of locomotor recovery. Wild-type flies displayed fast and consistent recovery of locomotion from anoxia, whereas mutants of w showed significantly delayed recovery. Genetic analysis including serial backcrossing revealed a strong association between the w locus and the timing of locomotor recovery, and haplo-insufficient function of w+ in promoting fast locomotor recovery. The locomotor recovery phenotype was independent of classic eye pigmentation, although both are associated with the w gene. Introducing up to four copies of mini-white (mw+) into w1118 was insufficient to promote fast and consistent locomotor recovery. However, flies carrying w+ duplicated to Y chromosome showed wild-type-like fast locomotor recovery. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of w in neurons but not glia delayed locomotor recovery, and specifically, knockdown of w in putative subsets of serotonin neurons was sufficient to delay the locomotor recovery.

This paper explores the correlations between siblings' sexes using data from the Demographic and Health Survey program. In the sample of about 2,214,601 women (7,985,855 children), the frequencies of sibships with multiple siblings of the same sex were significantly higher than can be expected by chance. A formal modelling demonstrated that sexes of the children were dependent on three kinds of sex ratio variation: a variation between families (Lexian), a variation within a family (Poisson) and a variation contingent upon the sex of preceding sibling (Markovian). There was a positive correlation between the sexes of successive siblings (coefficient = 0.067, p < 0.001), i.e. a child was more likely to be of the same sex as its preceding sibling. This correlation could be caused by secondary sex ratio adjustment in utero since the effect was decreasing with the length of birth-to-birth interval, and the birth-to-birth interval was longer for siblings with unlike sex.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print906.pdf,"[( 12 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 16 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 24 Nov 2015 , 1)]"

The molecular mechanism by which guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyse the activation of monomeric G proteins is well-established, however the complete reversibility of this mechanism is often overlooked. Here, we use a theoretical approach to prove that GEFs are unable to positively control G protein systems at steady-state in the absence of GTPase activity. Instead, positive regulation of G proteins must be seen as a product of the competition between guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity -- emphasising a central role for GTPase activity beyond merely signal termination. We conclude that a more accurate description of the regulation of G proteins via these processes is as a 'balance/imbalance' mechanism.

However, it is unlikely that this mechanism is so straightforward in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Since becoming self-compatible roughly 1 MYA high selfing rates have caused high homozygosity levels which in turn can be expected to reduce pollen competition and the effect of masking in diploid expressed, sporophytic genes.

Applying this approach to two independent MEG-fMRI data sets, we observed that neural activity first emerged in the occipital pole at 50-80ms, before spreading rapidly and progressively in the anterior direction along the ventral and dorsal visual streams.

We use a genetic algorithm to generate and score codes from different parts of the associated landscape, and are, as a result presumably more representative of the entire landscape. Our results show that while the genetic code is sub-optimal for robustness to frameshift mutation and the ability to encode additional information in the coding region, it is very strongly selected for robustness to point mutation.

In recent years, heritability estimation using linear mixed models (LMMs) has gained popularity, because these estimates can be obtained from unrelated individuals collected in genome wide association studies. Typically, heritability estimation under LMMs uses either the maximum likelihood (ML) or the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach. Existing methods for the construction of confidence intervals and estimators of standard errors for both ML and REML rely on asymptotic properties. However, these assumptions are often violated due to the bounded parameter space, statistical dependencies, and limited sample size, leading to biased estimates, and inflated or deflated confidence intervals. Here, we show that often the probability that the genetic component is estimated as zero is high even when the true heritability is bounded away from zero, emphasizing the need for accurate confidence intervals. We further show that the estimation of confidence intervals by state-of-the-art methods is highly inaccurate, especially when the true heritability is either relatively low or relatively high. Such biases are present, for example, in estimates of heritability of gene expression in the GTEx study, and of lipid profiles in the LURIC study. We propose a computationally efficient method, Accurate LMM-Based confidence Intervals (ALBI), for the estimation of the distribution of the heritability estimator, and for the construction of accurate confidence intervals. Our method can be used as an add-on to existing methods for heritability and variance components estimation, such as GCTA, FaST-LMM, GEMMA, or EMMA.

Through simulation analysis we investigate the fit of tumor incidence curves generated using exponential and power law Distributions of Fitness Effects (DFE) to known tumorigenesis incidence. Modeling considerations include the architecture of stem cell populations, i.e., a large number of very small populations, and mutations that do and do not fix neutrally in the stem cell niche.  We find that the typically quantified DFE in whole organisms is sufficient to explain tumorigenesis incidence. Further, due to the effects of small stem cell population sizes, i.e., strong genetic drift, deleterious mutations are predicted to accumulate, resulting in reduced tissue maintenance.

Not surprisingly, abnormal maintenance of progenitor transcription factors may lead to tissue overgrowth, and the concurrence of specific signals from the local environment is often critical to trigger this overgrowth. Therefore, the identification of the specific combinations of transcription factors and signals that promote or oppose proliferation in progenitor cells is essential to understand normal development and disease. We have investigated this issue by asking what signals may promote the proliferation of eye progenitors in Drosophila. Two transcription factors, the MEIS1 homologue homothorax (hth) and the Zn-finger teashirt (tsh) are transiently expressed in eye progenitors causing the expansion of the progenitor pool. However, if their co-expression is maintained experimentally, cell proliferation continues and differentiation is halted. Here we show that Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 ligand Dpp and the activation of its pathway. In Hth+Tsh cells, the Dpp pathway is abnormally hyperactivated. Rather than using autocrine Dpp expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by upregulating extracellular matrix components. During normal development, Dpp represses hth and tsh ensuring that the progenitor state is transient. However, cells in which Hth+Tsh expression is maintained use Dpp to enhance their proliferation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Developmental Biology/Developmental Biology1.pdf,"[( 30 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 26 Nov 2015 , 5)]"

One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well.

Evidence
suggests the function of DNA methylation may vary with genomic context, and few consistent rules linking methylation to
expression have been noted. For array-based studies, the content of current DNA methylation array platforms provide broad
coverage of the genome but target only a fraction of the potentially methylated CG dinucleotides. A better understanding of the
interplay between DNA methylation and gene expression is beneficial for users of these platforms, and may aid with candidate
prioritization in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). To address this we examined the relationship between DNA
methylation levels and gene expression in primary T-lymphocytes at discreet genomic regions around the transcriptional unit
(Promoters, gene body, untranslated regions) and at CpG island-associated regions (islands, shores and shelves), stratifying
by high and low expressed genes. As anticipated we found evidence that DNA methylation at CpG sites near promoter regions
are tightly correlated with gene expression in both the stably expressed and developmentally regulated genes, however this
is dependent on CpG density. DNA methylation within the gene body was not consistently associated with changes in gene
expression. CpG islands and island shores exhibited strong correlations with gene expression, but this was not true for island
shelves. We found these relationships were generally preserved at both dynamic and steady state genes, with some notable
exceptions. In combination these insights may be useful for prioritising candidates identified in epigenome-wide association

social and technological challenges. We consider the case where a user searches for genetic
information (e.g., an allele) on a server that stores a large genomic database and aims to receive
allele-associated information. The user would like to keep the query and result private and the
server the database.

Approach: We propose a novel approach that combines efficient string data structures such as
the Burrows-Wheeler transform with cryptographic techniques based on additive homomorphic
encryption. We assume that the sequence data is searchable in efficient iterative query operations
over a large indexed dictionary, for instance, from large genome collections and employing the
(positional) Burrows-Wheeler transform. We use a technique called oblivious transfer that is
based on additive homomorphic encryption to conceal the sequence query and the genomic
region of interest in positional queries.

Results: We designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for searching sequences of SNPs
in large genome databases. During search, the user can only identify the longest match while
the server does not learn which sequence of SNPs the user queries. In an experiment based
on 2,184 aligned haploid genomes from the 1,000 Genomes Project, our algorithm was able to
perform typical queries within ≈4.6 seconds and ≈10.8 seconds seconds for client and server side,

Different 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) isoforms interact with different RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which modify the stability, translation, and subcellular localization of the corresponding transcripts. Although the heterogeneity of pre-mRNA 3′ end processing has been established with high-throughput approaches, the mechanisms that underlie systematic changes in 3′ UTR lengths remain to be characterized. Through a uniform analysis of a large number of 3′ end sequencing data sets we have uncovered 18 signals, 6 of which novel, whose positioning with respect to pre-mRNA cleavage sites indicates a role in pre-mRNA 3′ end processing in both mouse and human. With 3′ end sequencing we have demonstrated that the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), which binds the poly(U) motif whose frequency also peaks in the vicinity of polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites, has a genome-wide effect on poly(A) site usage. HNRNPC-regulated 3′ UTRs are enriched in ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1) binding sites and include those of the CD47 molecule (CD47) gene, which participate in the recently discovered mechanism of 3′ UTR-dependent protein localization (UDPL). Our study thus establishes an up-to-date, high-confidence catalog of 3′ end processing sites and poly(A) signals and it uncovers an important role of HNRNPC in regulating 3′ end processing.

Unfortunately, most existing algorithms designed to identify these domains assume that they are non-overlapping whereas there is substantial evidence to believe a nested structure exists. We present an efficient methodology to predict hierarchical chromatin domains using chromatin conformation capture data. Our method predicts domains at different resolutions and uses these to construct a hierarchy that is based on intrinsic properties of the chromatin data. The hierarchy consists of a set of non-overlapping domains, that maximize intra-domain interaction frequencies, at each level.

Previous attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major metazoan phyla - with the notable exception of humans and primates. The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be positively correlated to species effective population size. This relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution due to more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors influencing the rate of adaptive evolution and positive selection detection in humans vs. other organisms are discussed.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics53.pdf,"[( 01 Dec 2015 , 4), ( 30 Nov 2015 , 23), ( 03 Dec 2015 , 2), ( 02 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 29 Nov 2015 , 10)]"

Here, we explore the possibility that novel non-coding RNA structures (ncRNAs) are embedded within intronic sequences and are contributing to phenotype and intron retention in yeast. We employed de novo RNA structure prediction tools to screen intronic sequences in S. cerevisiae and 36 other fungi. We identified and validated 19 new intronic RNAs via RNAseq and RT-PCR. Contrary to common belief that excised introns are rapidly degraded, we found that, in six cases, the excised introns were maintained intact in the cells. In other two cases we showed that the ncRNAs were further processed from their introns. RNAseq analysis confirmed higher expression of introns in the ribosomial protein genes containing predicted RNA structures. We deleted the novel intronic RNA structure within the GLC7 intron and showed that this predicted ncRNA, rather than the intron itself, is responsible for the cell???s ability to respond to salt stress. We also showed a direct association between the presence of the intronic ncRNA and GLC7 expression.

We construct a simple computational model of carcinogenesis in premalignant disease and use the model to evaluate an extensive list of tissue sampling strategies and different molecular measures of these samples. Our model predicts that: (i) taking more biopsies improves prognostication, but with diminishing returns for each additional biopsy; (ii) longitudinally-collected biopsies provide slightly more prognostic information than a single biopsy collected at the latest possible time-point; (iii) measurements of clonal diversity are more prognostic than measurements of the presence or absence of a particular abnormality and are particularly robust to confounding by tissue sampling; and (iv) the spatial pattern of clonal expansions is a particularly prognostic measure.

Dams alter natural hydrological regimes, homogenize river system dynamics at a global scale, can act as barriers for migratory species and may facilitate species invasions. In this synthesis, we examined the short- and long-term effects of impoundment on fish population dynamics and community structure. At the population level, we tested the ""trophic surge hypothesis"", which predicts a hump-shaped response of fish abundance through time after impoundment. We tested the hypothesis on 40 recruitment time series and 125 adult abundance time series from 19 species and nine reservoirs distributed in temperate and boreal regions. At the community level, we compared diversity metrics (richness, evenness, diversity) on two datasets: 1) between reservoirs and reference ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and streams) and 2) over time (before and after impoundment and over time). At the population level, the trophic surge hypothesis was supported in more than 55% of the time series but we observed significant variation across species, reservoirs and regions. Fish recruitment increased substantially during reservoir filling and shortly after impoundment, and was usually followed by an increase in adult fish. The surge was transient and vanished after 3-4 years for recruits and after 10 years for adults. However, we are lacking long time series to conclude about population patterns in the trophic equilibrium phase. At the community level, we did not find any strong directional patterns in species diversity metrics when comparing reservoirs to reference lakes but found higher diversity and evenness in reservoirs and impounded streams/rivers relative to unimpounded streams/rivers. We did not find directional patterns when looking at a change over time. Variability in the reported diversity results across studies may be related to the ability to tease apart the unique effects of impoundment and water regulation from other stressors such as propagule pressure and eutrophication, as well as the comparability of the reference system. In conclusion, fish populations benefited quickly but transiently from impoundment, and longer time series are needed to conclude about population dynamics and equilibrium in aging reservoirs in order to develop management recommendations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print925.pdf,"[( 01 Dec 2015 , 6)]"

While the whole-genome methylation pattern has been generally conserved in different eukaryotic groups, invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit two distinct patterns. Whereas almost all CpG sites are methylated in most vertebrates, with the exception of short unmethylated regions call CpG islands, the most frequent pattern in invertebrate animals is ‘mosaic methylation’, comprising domains of heavily methylated DNA interspersed with domains that are methylation free. The mechanism by which the genome methylation pattern transited from a mosaic to a global pattern and the role of the one or two-round whole-genome duplication in this transition remain largely elusive, partly owing to the lack of methylome data from early vertebrates. In this study, we used the whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing technology to investigate the genome-wide methylation in three tissues (heart, muscle, and sperm) from the sea lamprey, an extant Agarthan vertebrate. Analyses of methylation level and the extent of CpG dinucleotide depletion of gene-encoding, intergenic and promoter regions revealed a gradual increase in the methylation level from invertebrates to vertebrates, with the sea lamprey exhibiting an intermediate position. In addition, the methylation level of the majority of CpGs was intermediate in each sea lamprey tissue, indicating a high level of heterogeneity of methylation status between individual cells. In this regard, we defined the genomic methylation pattern of sea lamprey as ???global genomic DNA intermediate methylation???. The methylation features in different genomic regions, such as the transcription start site (TSS) region of the gene body, exon-intron boundaries, transposons, as well as genes grouping with different expression levels, supported the gradual methylation transition hypothesis. We further discussed that the copy number difference in DNA methylation transferases and the loss of the PWWP domain and/or DNTase domain in DNMT3 sub-family enzymes may have contributed to the methylation pattern transition in early vertebrates. These findings demonstrate an intermediate genomic methylation pattern between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates, providing evidence that supports the hypothesis that methylation patterns underwent a gradual transition from invertebrates (mosaic) to vertebrates (global).",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print926.pdf,"[( 30 Dec 2015 , 3), ( 01 Dec 2015 , 7), ( 21 Dec 2015 , 3), ( 20 Dec 2015 , 3)]"

However, a large-scale, combined analysis of methylome and transcriptome data to infer downstream effects of disease variants is lacking.

Trans-meQTL CpG sites are enriched for active regulatory regions, being correlated with gene expression and overlap with Hi-C determined interchromosomal contacts. We detected many trans-meQTL SNPs that affect expression levels of nearby transcription factors (including NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3), while the corresponding trans-meQTL CpG sites frequently coincide with its respective binding site.

In particular, we present an exact method to compute the population size as a function of time using the distributions of coalescent-times of samples of any size. This result reduces the problem of population size inference to a problem of estimating coalescent-time distributions. Using tree inference algorithms and genetic data, we can investigate the effects of a range of conditions associated with real data, for instance finite number of loci, sample size, mutation rate and presence of cryptic recombination. We show that our method requires at least a modest number of loci (10,000 or more) and that increasing the sample size from 2 to 10 greatly improves the inference whereas further increase in sample size only results in a modest improvement, even under as scenario of exponential growth. We also show that small amounts of recombination can lead to biased population size reconstruction when unaccounted for. The approach can handle large sample sizes and the computations are fast.

The relative distribution of major phyla was significantly different between the two substrates and biodiversity estimates, from 16S rRNA gene sequences and from the metagenome data, all pointed to a higher taxonomic diversity in the calcite community. While both endolithic communities showed adaptations to extreme aridity and to the rock habitat, their functional capabilities revealed significant differences. ABC transporters and pathways for osmoregulation were more diverse in the calcite chasmoendolithic community. In contrast, the ignimbrite cryptoendolithic community was enriched in pathways for secondary metabolites, such as non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) and polyketides (PKS). Assemblies of the metagenome data produced population genomes for the major phyla found in both communities and revealed a greater diversity of Cyanobacteria population genomes for the calcite substrate.

The two annotated proteomes shared 64% amino acid identity and a significantly higher number of genes involved in iron update, and NRPS gene clusters, were found in the draft genomes from the ignimbrite.

Here we propose to use a more powerful statistical approach that enables the prediction of multiple medically relevant phenotypes without the costs associated with developing a genetic test for each of them. As a proof of principle, we used a common panel of 319,038 SNPs to train the prediction models in 114,264 unrelated White-British for height and four obesity related traits (body mass index, basal metabolic rate, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio). We obtained prediction accuracies that ranged between 46% and 75% of the maximum achievable given their explained heritable component. This represents an improvement of up to 75% over the phenotypic variance explained by the predictors developed through large collaborations, which used more than twice as many training samples. Across-population predictions in White non-British individuals were similar to those of White-British whilst those in Asian and Black individuals were informative but less accurate. The genotyping of circa 500,000 UK Biobank participants will yield predictions ranging between 66% and 83% of the maximum. We anticipate that our models and a common panel of genetic markers, which can be used across multiple traits and diseases, will be the starting point to tailor disease management to the individual.

Recent technologies such as Microarray and Next Generation Sequencing have paved the way for computational methods and techniques to play critical roles in this regard. Many important problems in cell biology require the dense nonlinear interactions between functional modules to be considered. The importance of computer simulation in understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of simulation algorithms useful for studying certain subsystems have been designed. In this article, a Sparse Compact Incremental Learning Machine (SCILM) is proposed for cancer classification problem on microarray gene expression data which take advantage of Correntropy cost that makes it robust against diverse noises and outliers. Moreover, since SCILM uses l1-norm of the weights, it has sparseness which can be applied for gene selection purposes as well.  Finally, due to compact structure, the proposed method is capable of performing classification tasks in all of the cases with only one neuron in its hidden layer. The experimental analysis is  performed on 26 well known microarray datasets regarding diverse kinds of cancers and the results show that the proposed method not only achieved significantly high accuracy but also because of its sparseness, final connectivity weights determined the value and effectivity of each gene regarding the corresponding cancer.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print930.pdf,"[( 03 Dec 2015 , 4), ( 08 Oct 2015 , 6)]"

If true, this would make adaptive evolution in sexual diploids differ drastically from that of haploids. Unfortunately, the validity of this prediction has not yet been tested experimentally. Here we performed 4 replicate evolutionary experiments with diploid yeast populations (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) growing in glucose-limited continuous cultures. We sequenced 24 evolved clones and identified initial adaptive mutations in all four chemostats. The first adaptive mutations in all four chemostats were three CNVs, all of which proved to be overdominant in fitness.

Recent studies discovered widespread shortening of 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains elusive. We thus applied our published PA-seq method to investigate APA regulation in different passages of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from rats of different ages. We found that genes in senescent cells tended to use distal poly(A) sites (pAs). An independent RNA-seq analysis gave rise to the same conclusion. Interestingly, the level of expression of genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs tended to decrease. More importantly, genes that preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs were enriched in common senescence-related pathways such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and cell cycle. Further, the longer 3′ UTRs of the genes that tended to use distal pAs introduced more conserved binding sites of senescence-related microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Noteworthy, the expression level of core factors involved in cleavage and the polyadenylation tended to decrease, while those factors showed opposite trend in cancer cells.

Using a combination of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing of 281 blaKPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolated from a single hospital over five years, we demonstrate rapid dissemination of this carbapenem resistance gene to multiple species, strains, and plasmids. Mobility of blaKPC occurs at multiple nested genetic levels, with transmission of blaKPC strains between individuals, frequent transfer of blaKPC plasmids between strains/species, and frequent transposition of the blaKPC transposon Tn4401 between plasmids. We also identify a common insertion site for Tn4401 within various Tn2-like elements, suggesting that homologous recombination between Tn2-like elements has enhanced the spread of Tn4401 between different plasmid vectors. Furthermore, while short-read sequencing has known limitations for plasmid assembly, various studies have attempted to overcome this with the use of reference-based methods. We also demonstrate that as a consequence of the genetic mobility observed herein, plasmid structures can be extremely dynamic, and therefore these reference-based methods, as well as traditional partial typing methods, can produce very misleading conclusions.

While spontaneous activity has been shown to instruct map formation in sensory circuits, it is  unknown whether it plays a role in the organization of motor networks that produce rhythmic output. Using computational modeling we investigate how recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations assemble to produce robust patterns of unidirectional and precisely-timed propagating activity during organism locomotion. One example is provided by the motor network in Drosophila larvae, which generates propagating peristaltic waves of muscle contractions during crawling. We examine two activity-dependent models which tune weak network connectivity based on spontaneous activity patterns: a Hebbian model, where coincident activity in neighboring populations strengthens connections between them; and a homeostatic model, where connections are homeostatically regulated to maintain a constant level of excitatory activity based on spontaneous input. The homeostatic model tunes network connectivity to generate robust activity patterns with the appropriate timing relationships between neighboring populations. These timing relationships can be modulated by the properties of spontaneous activity suggesting its instructive role for generating functional variability in network output. In contrast, the Hebbian model fails to produce the tight timing relationships between neighboring populations required for unidirectional activity propagation, even when additional assumptions are imposed to constrain synaptic growth.  These results argue that homeostatic mechanisms are more likely than Hebbian mechanisms to tune weak connectivity based on local activity patterns in a recurrent network for rhythm generation and propagation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Neuroscience/Journal of Neuroscience7.pdf,"[( 03 Dec 2015 , 4)]"

Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that includes interspecific competition amongst species. Competition is modelled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve towards distinct niches, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We used an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to estimate model parameters.

Objective: The objective of this study is to provide a clinical validation of the sensitivity and specificity of a novel NIPT for detection of genome-wide abnormalities.
Study Design: This retrospective, blinded study included maternal plasma collected from 1222 study subjects with pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities that were assessed for trisomy 21 (T21), trisomy 18 (T18), trisomy 13 (T13), sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), fetal sex, genome-wide copy number variants (CNVs) 7 Mb and larger, and select deletions smaller than 7 Mb. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G-band karyotyping, microarray data, or high coverage sequencing.
Results: Clinical sensitivity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, T13, and SCAs, and 97.7% for genome-wide CNVs. Clinical specificity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, and T13, and 99.9% for SCAs and CNVs. Fetal sex classification had an accuracy of 99.6%.

We have found that variation in gene expression is much greater than currently believed, and that it can be measured with available technologies. Our results also explain, at least partially, the problems encountered in transcriptomics studies. We expect this improvement in detection to help efforts to realize the full potential of gene expression profiling, especially in analyses of cellular processes involving complex modulations of gene expression.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports40.pdf,"[( 20 Jun 2015 , 4), ( 19 Jun 2015 , 15), ( 04 Dec 2015 , 2), ( 30 Jun 2015 , 2), ( 22 Jun 2015 , 1), ( 22 Jul 2015 , 2)]"

Here we show that fMRI pattern similarity estimates are severely affected by temporal pattern drifts in fMRI data - even after voxel-wise detrending. For this particular dataset, the drift effect obscures orientation information as measured by fMRI pattern dissimilarities. We demonstrate that orientation information can be recovered using three different methods: 1. Regressing out the drift component through linear modeling; 2. Computing representational distances between conditions measured in independent imaging runs; 3. Crossvalidation of pattern distance estimates. One possible source of temporal pattern drift could be random walk like fluctuations - physiological or scanner related - occurring within single voxel timecourses. This explanation is consistent with voxel-wise detrending not alleviating pattern drift effects. In addition, this would explain why cross-validated pattern distances are robust to temporal drift because a random walk process is expected to give rise to non-replicable drift directions.

While many endogenous homeostatic motifs have been studied in living cells, some other motifs may remain under-explored or even undiscovered. At the same time, known regulatory motifs have been mostly analyzed at the deterministic level, and the effect of noise on their regulatory function has received low attention. Here we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at the molecular level that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and design of robust homeostatic circuits. Using these ideas, we propose a new regulation motif, which we refer to as antithetic integral feedback, and demonstrate its effectiveness as a strategy for generically regulating a wide class of reaction networks. By combining tools from probability and control theory, we show that the proposed motif preserves the stability of the overall network, steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point, and achieves robust perfect adaptation -- all with low prior knowledge of reaction rates. Moreover, our proposed regulatory motif can be implemented using a very small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load. Strikingly, the regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise, leading to enhanced regulation in scenarios where noise-free implementations result in dysregulation.

As a proxy for intrinsic constraints I quantified different aspects of the phenotypic covariation structure within species, and compared them with the among-species divergence patterns, using phylogenetic comparative methods. My results show that for most species, divergence is well aligned with their phenotypic covariance matrix, and those that are better aligned have diverged further away from their ancestor. Bovids have dispersed into a wider range of directions in morphospace than cervids, and their overall disparity is higher. This difference is best explained by the lower eccentricity of bovids within-species covariance matrices.

There are two potential explanations: either mutation produces genetic variation at different rates, or natural selection removes or promotes genetic variation at different rates.  Whether mutation or selection is of greater general importance is a longstanding unresolved question in evolutionary genetics.  Where the input of genetic variation by mutation differs between traits, it is usually uncertain whether the difference is the result of different mutational effects (""mutational robustness"") or different numbers of underlying loci (""mutational target""), although conventional wisdom favors the latter.  We report mutational variances (VM) for 19 traits related to the first mitotic cell division in C. elegans, and compare them to the standing genetic variances (VG) for the same suite of traits in a worldwide collection C. elegans.  Two robust conclusions emerge.  First, the mutational process is highly repeatable: the correlation between VM in two independent sets of mutation accumulation lines is ~0.9.  Second, VM for a trait is a very good predictor of VG for that trait: the correlation between VM and VG is ~0.9.  This result is predicted for a population at mutation-selection balance; it is not predicted if balancing selection plays a primary role in maintaining genetic variation.

One widely accepted hypothesis developed from both theoretical and empirical analyses is that habitat variability promotes network modularity; however, this relationship has not yet been directly tested in higher organisms. Therefore, I investigated the relationship between habitat variability and metabolic network modularity using compound and enzymatic networks in flies and mammals. Contrary to expectation, there was no clear positive correlation between habitat variability and network modularity. As an exception, the network modularity increased with habitat variability in the enzymatic networks of flies. However, the observed association was likely an artifact, and the frequency of gene duplication appears to be the main factor contributing to network modularity.

We discovered 166 bat accelerated regions (BARs) that overlap H3K27ac and p300 ChIP-seq peaks in developing mouse limbs. Using a mouse enhancer assay, we show that five Myotis lucifugus BARs drive gene expression in the developing mouse limb, with the majority showing differential enhancer activity compared to the mouse orthologous BAR sequences. These include BAR116, which is located telomeric to the HoxD cluster and had robust forelimb expression for the M. lucifugus sequence and no activity for the mouse sequence at embryonic day 12.5. Developing limb expression analysis of Hoxd10-Hoxd13 in Miniopterus natalensis bats showed a high-forelimb weak-hindlimb expression for Hoxd10-Hoxd11, similar to the expression trend observed for M. lucifugus BAR116 in mice, suggesting that it could be involved in the regulation of the bat HoxD complex. Combined, our results highlight novel regulatory regions that could be instrumental for the morphological differences leading to the development of the bat wing.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics54.pdf,"[( 09 Dec 2015 , 6), ( 10 Dec 2015 , 4)]"

In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent ""self-organizing"" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual—understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint—emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes for cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Theoretical Biology/Journal of Theoretical Biology10.pdf,"[( 01 Jul 2015 , 5), ( 04 May 2015 , 6), ( 14 Aug 2015 , 2), ( 25 Mar 2015 , 2), ( 23 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 14 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 22 Jul 2015 , 5), ( 29 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 27 Mar 2015 , 1), ( 26 May 2015 , 5), ( 18 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 05 Aug 2015 , 1), ( 05 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 19 May 2016 , 2), ( 28 Jul 2015 , 4), ( 29 Mar 2015 , 3), ( 03 Apr 2015 , 5), ( 14 Jul 2015 , 4), ( 09 Dec 2015 , 8), ( 15 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 22 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 31 Mar 2015 , 5), ( 02 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 21 May 2016 , 1), ( 16 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 15 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 04 Apr 2015 , 1), ( 04 Aug 2015 , 5), ( 07 Jul 2015 , 6), ( 13 Aug 2015 , 3), ( 13 Nov 2015 , 8), ( 26 Mar 2015 , 6)]"

In addition to the PAR1 and PAR2, there is a human-specific X-transposed region that was duplicated from the X to the Y. The X-transposed region is often not excluded from X-specific analyses, unlike the PARs, because it is not thought to routinely recombine. Genetic diversity is expected to be higher in recombining regions than in non-recombining regions because recombination reduces the effect of linked selection. In this study, we investigate patterns of genetic diversity in noncoding regions across the entire X chromosome of a global sample of 26 unrelated genetic females. We observe that genetic diversity in the PAR1 is significantly greater than the non-recombining regions (nonPARs). However, rather than an abrupt drop in diversity at the pseudoautosomal boundary, there is a gradual reduction in diversity from the recombining through the non-recombining region, suggesting that recombination between the human sex chromosomes spans across the currently defined pseudoautosomal boundary. In contrast, diversity in the PAR2 is not significantly elevated compared to the nonPAR, suggesting that recombination is not obligatory in the PAR2.

We performed simultaneous extracellular field and unit recordings in four connected areas of the freely moving rat (S1BF, V1M, perirhinal cortex, CA1). S1BF spiking activity was strongly entrained by both beta and gamma S1BF oscillations, which were associated with deactivations and activations, respectively.

However, the complexity of transmission dynamic models causes two challenges: Firstly, the likelihood function of the models is generally not computable and computationally intensive simulation-based inference methods need to be employed. Secondly, the model may not be fully identifiable from the available data. While the first difficulty can be tackled by computational and algorithmic advances, the second obstacle is more fundamental. Identifiability issues may lead to inferences which are more driven by the prior assumptions than the data themselves. We here consider a popular and relatively simple, yet analytically intractable model for the spread of tuberculosis based on classical IS6110 fingerprinting data. We report on the identifiability of the model, presenting also some methodological advances regarding the inference. Using likelihood approximations, it is shown that the reproductive value cannot be identified from the data available and that the posterior distributions obtained in previous work have likely been substantially dominated by the assumed prior distribution.

Here we describe an extension to the popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of BiSSE methods. Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden-State Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed state in the model are ""hidden"" states that exhibit potentially distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model can be used as character-independent diversification (CID) models that allow for a complex diversification process that is independent of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate differences between observed and hidden states and detect when diversification rate differences do not correlate with the observed states.

We model the evolution of virulence using the adaptive dynamics framework, showing that parasite virulence should decrease when the vector's dynamics randomly change in time. The decrease is even more pronounced when environmental variations are frequent and ample. This decrease in virulence can be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy: when a parasite is at a risk of not being transmitted (e.g. because vectors are scarce), its best option is to stay in the host longer - that is, to be less virulent. Lowering virulence is thus very similar to increasing iteroparity, a well-known risk-spreading strategy, and should be expected to evolve whenever parasite transmission varies randomly in time.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print949.pdf,"[( 09 Dec 2015 , 5), ( 10 Dec 2015 , 2)]"

Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease
conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping
steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing
that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-
effective strategy of profiling only  ̃1,000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to
infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program
is currently based on linear regression, limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship
between expression of genes.

Results:
We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression
of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based GEO dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our
model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across
all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms linear regression with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise
comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than linear regression in 99.97% of the target
genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which
consists of 2,921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms linear regression with 6.57% relative improvement,
and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.

Especially the impressive aerial performance of insects relies on rapid and precise integration of multiple sensory modalities that provide feedback on different time scales. In flies, continuous visual signalling from the compound eyes is fused with phasic proprioceptive feedback to ensure precise neural activation of wing steering muscles within narrow temporal phase bands of the stroke cycle. This phase-locked activation relies on mechanoreceptors distributed over wings and gyroscopic halteres. Here we investigate visual steering performance of tethered flying fruit flies with reduced haltere and wing feedback signalling. Using a flight simulator, we evaluated visual object fixation behaviour, optomotor altitude control, and saccadic escape reflexes. The behavioural assays show an antagonistic effect of wing and haltere signalling on visuomotor gain during flight. Compared to controls, suppression of haltere feedback attenuates while suppression of wing feedback enhances the animal's wing steering range. Our results suggest that the generation of motor commands owing to visual perception is dynamically controlled by proprioception. We outline a potential physiological mechanism based on the biomechanical properties of wing steering muscles and sensory integration processes at the level of motoneurons.

However, numerous evolutionary processes are known to violate the assumptions of a coalescence-only model and complicate inference of the species tree. One such process is hybrid speciation, in which a species shares its ancestry with two distinct species.  Although many methods have been proposed to detect hybrid speciation, only a few have considered both hybridization and coalescence in a unified framework, and these are generally limited to the setting in which putative hybrid species must be identified in advance. Here we propose a method that can examine genome-scale data for a large number of taxa and detect those taxa that may have arisen via hybridization, as well as their potential ``parental'' taxa.  The method is based on a model that considers both coalescence and hybridization together, and uses phylogenetic invariants to construct a test that scales well in terms of computational time for both the number of taxa and the amount of sequence data. We test the method using simulated data for up 20 taxa and 100,000bp, and find that the method accurately identifies both recent and ancient hybrid species in less than 30 seconds.

Breast cancer (BC) ranks among the most common cancers in Sudan and worldwide

a common BC signature characterized by low frequency of oncogenic mutations and
high frequency of epigenetic silencing of major BC tumor suppressor genes. Therefore,
we conducted a genome-wide methylome study to characterize aberrant DNA
methylation in breast cancer.
Results
Differential methylation analysis between primary tumor samples and normal samples
from healthy adjacent tissues yielded 20188 differentially methylated positions (DMPs),
which is further divided into 13633 hypermethylated sites corresponding to 5339 genes

Based on principles from information theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic model, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all species maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche and allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea to the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more than compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining populations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to maintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the advantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining populations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison with asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already significantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic complexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity. The model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses about the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red Queen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases population frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones.

The response in phosphorylated histone H2AX and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) double-stained foci to the topoisomerase poison camptothecin in cells treated with a control shRNA and with sh-EWSR1 further suggests that EWSR1 functions in the prevention of DNA DSBs. Our data reveal a new function of the EWSR1 member of the FET family and suggest a connection between the RNA-binding activity of EWSR1 and the instability of its own locus that may play a role in malignancy-associated translocations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print957.pdf,"[( 17 Dec 2015 , 2), ( 15 Dec 2015 , 5)]"

Recent evidence suggests that the arrangement of stomata on abaxial (lower) and adaxial (upper) leaf surfaces may be an important adaptation in plants, but stomatal traits on each surface likely share developmental pathways that could hamper evolution. We reviewed the quantitative genetics of stomatal density to look for loci that (1) affected ab- or adaxial density independently or (2) pleiotropically affected stomatal density on both surfaces. We also used phylogenetic comparative methods to test for independent versus correlated evolution of stomatal traits (density, size, and pore index) on each surface from 14 amphistomatous wild tomato taxa (Solanum; Solanaceae). Naturally occurring and laboratory-induced genetic variation alters stomatal density on one surface without affecting the other, indicating that development does not strongly constrain the spectrum of available mutations. Among wild tomato taxa, traits most closely related to function (stomatal pore index and density) evolved independently on each surface, whereas stomatal size was constrained by correlated evolution.

To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a ""prediction error"" while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is achieved when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced.

The clock mechanism in the laboratory model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana is complex, in part due to the multiple interlocking, negative feedback loops that link the clock genes. Clock gene mutants are powerful tools to manipulate and understand the clock mechanism and its effects on physiology. The LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 genes encode dawn-expressed, Myb-related repressor proteins that delay the expression of other clock genes until late in the day. Double mutant plants (lhy cca1) have low-amplitude, short-period rhythms that have been used in multiple studies of the plant circadian clock.

Results: We used in vivo imaging of several luciferase (LUC) reporter genes to test how the rhythmic gene expression of wild-type and lhy cca1 mutant plants responded to light:dark cycles. Red, blue and red+blue light were similarly able to entrain these gene expression rhythms. The timing of expression rhythms in double mutant plants showed little or no response to the duration of light under 24h light:dark cycles (dusk sensitivity), in contrast to the wild type. As the period of the mutant clock is about 18h, we tested light:dark cycles of different duration (T cycles), simulating altered rotation of planet Earth. lhy cca1 double mutants regained as much dusk sensitivity in 20h T cycles as the wild type in 24h cycles, though the phase of the rhythm in the mutants was much earlier than wild type. The severe, triple lhy cca1 gi mutants also regained dusk sensitivity in 20h cycles. The double mutant showed some dusk sensitivity under 28h cycles. lhy cca1 double mutants under 28h cycles with short photoperiods, however, had the same apparent phase as wild-type plants.

Conclusion: Simulating altered planetary rotation with light:dark cycles can reveal normal circadian performance in clock mutants that have been described as arrhythmic under standard conditions. The features rescued here comprise a dynamic behaviour (apparent phase under 28h cycles) and a dynamic property (dusk sensitivity under 20h cycles). These conditional clock phenotypes indicate that parts of the clock mechanism continue to function independently of LHY and CCA1, despite the major role of these genes in wild-type plants under standard conditions.

Theory has long held that plasticity can evolve when information about the future environment is reliable while bet-hedging can evolve when mixtures of phenotypes have high average fitness (leading to low among generation variance in fitness). To date, no study has studied the evolutionary routes that lead to the evolution of randomized offspring phenotypes on the one hand or deterministic maternal effects on the other. We develop simple, yet general, models of the evolution of maternal effects and are able to directly compare selection for deterministic and randomizing maternal effects and can also incorporate the notion of differential maternal costs of producing  offspring with alternative phenotypes. We find that  only a small set of parameters allow bet hedging type strategies to outcompete deterministic maternal effects. Not only must there be little or no informative cues available, but also the frequency with which different environments are present must fall within a narrow range. By contrast, when we consider the joint evolution of the maternal strategy and the set of offspring phenotypes we find that deterministic maternal effects can always invade the ancestral state (lacking any form of maternal effect). The long-term ESS may, however, involve some form of offspring randomization, but only if the phenotypes evolve extreme differences in environment-specific fitness.  Overall we conclude that deterministic maternal effects are much more likely to evolve than offspring randomization, and offspring randomization will only be maintained if it results in extreme differences in environment-specific fitness.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/The American Naturalist/The American Naturalist6.pdf,"[( 01 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 30 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 17 Dec 2015 , 7)]"

We put the selectivity-hypothesis to test by assessing the performance of 10 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia on demanding tests of visual object processing involving both regular and degraded drawings. None of the individuals exhibited a dissociation between face and object recognition, and as a group they were significantly more affected by degradation of objects than control participants. Importantly, we also find positive correlations between the severity of the face recognition impairment and the degree of impaired performance with degraded objects.

Recently, several fast metagenomic classifiers have been developed, which are based on comparison of genomic k-mers. However, nucleotide comparison using a fixed k-mer length often lacks the sensitivity to overcome the evolutionary distance between sampled species and genomes in the reference database. Here, we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju for fast assignment of reads to taxa. Kaiju finds maximum exact matches on the protein-level using the Borrows-Wheeler transform, and can optionally allow amino acid substitutions in the search using a greedy heuristic. We show in a genome exclusion study that Kaiju can classify more reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared to fast k-mer based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies more than twice as many reads in ten real metagenomes compared to programs based on genomic k-mers. Kaiju can process up to millions of reads per minute, and its memory footprint is below 6 GB of RAM, allowing the analysis on a standard PC. The program is available under the GPL3 license at:

that the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint

Heterozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 have been identified in patients with a range of complex phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism and schizophrenia.

We describe a consanguineous family carrying a deletion in CNTNAP2 predicted to abolish function of its protein product, CASPR2. Affected family members show epilepsy, facial dysmorphisms, severe intellectual disability and impaired language. We compared these patients with previously reported individuals carrying homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 and identified a highly recognisable phenotype.

We propose that CASPR2 loss produces a syndrome involving early-onset refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, language impairment and autistic features that can be recognized as CASPR2 deficiency disorder.

Although TEs may occasionally play an adaptive role in their host's genome, they are much more often deleterious, and purifying selection is thus an important factor controlling genomic TE loads. In contrast, life history and genomic characteristics such as mating system, parasitism, GC content, and RNAi pathways, have been suggested to account for the startling disparity of TE loads in different species. Previous studies of fungal, plant, and animal genomes have reported conflicting results regarding the direction in which these genomic features drive TE evolution. Many of these studies have had limited power because they studied taxonomically narrow systems, comparing only a limited number of phylogenetically independent contrasts, and did not address long term effects on TE evolution. Here we explicitly test the long term determinants of TE evolution by comparing 42 nematode genomes that span over 500 million years of diversification, and include numerous transitions between life history states and RNAi pathways. We have analysed the reconstructed TE loads of ancestors through the Nematoda phylogeny to account for correlation with GC content and transitions in TE evolutionary models. We also analysed the effect of transitions in life history characteristics and RNAi using ANOVA of phylogenetically independent contrasts. We show that purifying selection against TEs is the dominant force throughout the evolutionary history of Nematoda, as indicated by reconstructed ancestral TE loads, and that strong stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are the underlying models which best explain TE diversification among extant species. In contrast we found no evidence that life history or RNAi variations have a significant influence upon genomic TE load across extended periods of evolutionary history. We suggest that these are largely inconsequential to the large differences in TE content observed between genomes and only by these large-scale comparisons can we distinguish long term and persistent effects from transient effects or misleading random changes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print971.pdf,"[( 20 Dec 2015 , 9), ( 22 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 21 Dec 2015 , 10), ( 28 Dec 2015 , 1)]"

We then used svclassify to cluster and classify these deletions as well as a set of high-confidence deletions from the 1000 Genomes Project and a set of breakpoint-resolved complex insertions from Spiral Genetics.  We find that likely SVs cluster separately from likely non-SVs based on our annotations, and that the SVs cluster into different types of deletions.  We then developed a supervised one-class classification method that uses a training set of random non-SV regions to determine whether candidate SVs have abnormal annotations different from most of the genome.  To test this classification method, we use our pedigree-based breakpoint-resolved SVs, SVs validated by the 1000 Genomes Project, and assembly-based breakpoint-resolved insertions, along with semi-automated visualization using svviz.
Conclusions:  We find that candidate SVs with high scores from multiple technologies have high concordance with PCR validation and an orthogonal consensus method MetaSV (99.7% concordant), and candidate SVs with low scores are questionable.  We distribute a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with high svclassify scores from these call sets for benchmarking SV callers.  We expect these methods to be particularly useful for establishing high-confidence SV calls for benchmark samples that have been characterized by multiple technologies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics37.pdf,"[( 24 May 2015 , 3), ( 18 May 2015 , 8), ( 17 May 2015 , 4), ( 19 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 18 Dec 2015 , 2), ( 26 May 2015 , 4)]"

In this work,
 we compute features of a “hydroxide once” mechanism for the hydride shift with quantum chemical calculations  based on the 3KCO (linear) and 3KCL (cyclic) X-ray/neutron structures.  
 The rigid boundary conditions of the active site “shoe-box”,  together with ionization states and proton orientations, enables large scale electronic 
structure calculations of the entire active site with greatly reduced configuration sampling.  In the reported hydroxide once mechanism, magnesium in the 2A ligation shifts to position 2B, ionizing the O2 proton of D-glucose,  which is accepted by ASP-287. In this step a novel stabilization is discovered; the K183/D255 proton toggle, providing a ∼10 kcal/mol stabilization through inductive  polarization over 5Å.  Then, hydride shifts from glucose-O2 to glucose-O1 (the interconversion) generating hydroxide (once) from the catalytic water.  This step is consistent with the observation of hyroxide in structure 3CWH, which we identify as a branch point. From this branch point, we find several routes to the solvent-free regeneration of catalytic water that is strongly exothermic (by ∼20 kcal/mol), yielding one additional hydrogen bond  more than the starting structure. This non-Michaelis behavior, strongly below the starting cyclic and linear total  energy,  explains the observed accumulation of hydroxide intermediate -- we postulate that forming permissive ionization states, required for cyclization, may be the rate limiting step.

During the sleep and awake states, this brain area
is characterized by the presence of two distinct dynamical regimes: in the sleep state activity is dominated by spindle oscillations (7-15 Hz) weakly affected by external stimuli, while in the awake state the activity is primarily driven by external stimuli. Here we develop a simple and computationally efficient model of the thalamus that exhibits two dynamical regimes with different information-processing capabilities, and study the transition between them. The network model includes glutamatergic thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons and gabaergic reticular (RE) neurons described by adaptative integrate-and-fire 
models in which spikes are induced by either depolarization or hyperpolarization rebound.
We found a range of connectivity conditions under which the thalamic network composed by these neurons displays the two aforementioned dynamical regimes. Our results show that TC-RE loops generate spindle-like oscillations and that a critical value of clustering in the RE-RE 
connections is necessary for the coexistence of the two regimes. We also observe that the transition between the two regimes occurs when the external excitatory input on TC neurons (mimicking sensory stimulation) is large enough to cause a significant fraction of them to switch from hyperpolarization-rebound-driven firing to 
depolarization-driven firing. Overall, our model gives a novel and clear description of the role that the two types of neurons and their connectivity play in the dynamical regimes observed in the thalamus, and in the transition between them.

During electrotaxis in a direct current electric field (EF), a cell migrates preferentially either towards the anode or cathode depending on the cell-type. However, the types and ranges of mechanisms coupling trans-cellular electric fields to cellular EF-sensitive signaling systems are largely unknown.  To address this cell biological phenomenon, I use transcriptomic data from a developmental genetic model in which multicellular social aggregation is induced by starvation of amoeboid cells. I find that the developmental proteome expressed during the streaming aggregation stage is measurably and substantially enriched in charged and highly polar amino acids relative to the proteomes of either the unicellular amoeboid or the multicellular fruiting body. This large-scale coding augmentation of EF-sensitive amino acid residues in thousands of streaming-specific proteins is accompanied by a proportional coding decrease in the number of small, uncharged amino acid residues. I also confirm an expected coding increase of biosynthetically costly amino acids in the proteome of the satiated feeding-stage amoeboid. These findings suggest that electrotactic capability is encoded broadly in the genetically regulated deployment of a developmental proteome with augmented EF-sensitivity.

Finally, there is pronounced variation in branch length between major haplogroups; haplogroups associated with Bantu-speakers have significantly longer branches.

Images of different species of mosquito and bee wings were uploaded onto the CO1 database and test wing images were analysed to determine if this resulted in the correct species being identified.

More importantly, there were no outliers in terms of growth, thus ruling out the evolution of population-based resistance. We also assayed the standing phenotypic variation of the selected populations, in terms of their growth on 94 different substrates. Contrary to expectations, there was no increase in the standing variation of the selected populations, nor was there any significant divergence from the ancestors. This suggested that the greater fitness in novel environments is brought about by selection at the level of the individuals, which restricts the suite of traits that can potentially evolve through this mechanism.

In eukaryotes and archaea, the CCA ends of tRNAs are synthesized post-transcriptionally by CCA-adding enzymes. In bacteria, tRNA genes template CCA
sporadically. In order to understand variation in how prokaryotic tRNA genes template CCA, we re-annotated tRNA genes in the tRNAdb-CE database. Among 132,129 prokaryotic tRNA genes, initiator tRNA genes template CCA at the highest average frequency (74.1%) over all functional classes except selenocysteine and pyrrolysine tRNA genes (88.1% and 100% respectively). Across bacterial phyla and a wide range of genome sizes, many lineages exist in which predominantly initiator tRNA genes template CCA. Preferential retention of CCA in initiator tRNA genes evolved multiple times during reductive genome evolution in Bacteria. Also, in a majority of cyanobacterial and actinobacterial genera, predominantly initiator tRNA genes template CCA. We suggest that cotranscriptional synthesis of initiator tRNA CCA 3′ ends can complement inefficient processing of initiator tRNA precursors, ""bootstrap"" rapid initiation of protein synthesis from a non-growing state, or contribute to an increase in cellular growth rates by reducing overheads of mass and energy to maintain nonfunctional tRNA precursors.

However, although models for linkage analysis have been well established for diploids, with some essential modifications for tetraploids, no models have been available thus far for polyploids at higher ploidy levels. The linkage analysis of polyploids typically requires knowledge about their meiotic mechanisms, depending on the origin of polyplody. Here we describe a computational modeling framework for linkage analysis in allohexaploids by integrating their preferential chromosomal-pairing meiotic feature into a mixture model setting. The framework, implemented with the EM algorithm, allows the simultaneous estimates of preferential pairing factors and the recombination fraction. We investigated statistical properties of the framework through extensive computer simulation and validated its usefulness and utility by analyzing a real data from a full-sib family of allohexaploid persimmon.

In natural populations besides recombination interference, RD may also be due to selection, mutation, gene conversion, drift and/or migration.  Therefore, similarly to LD, RD will also reflect the history of natural selection and mutation. In breeding populations, RD purely results from recombination interference and hence can be used to build or evaluate and correct a linkage map.  Several practical examples from F2, testcross and human populations indeed demonstrate that RD is useful for measuring recombination interference between two short intervals and evaluating linkage maps.

However, a serious dilemma arises when the database holder also wants to output no information except for the search results, and such a dilemma prevents the use of many important data resources. In order to overcome this dilemma, we developed a novel cryptographic protocol that enables database searching while keeping both the query holder's privacy and database holder's privacy. Generally, the application of cryptographic techniques to practical problems is difficult because versatile techniques are computationally expensive while computationally inexpensive techniques can perform only trivial computation tasks. In this study, our protocol is successfully built only from an additive-homomorphic cryptosystem, which allows only addition performed on encrypted values but is computationally efficient compared with versatile techniques such as general purpose multi-party computation. In an experiment searching ChEMBL, which consists of more than 1,200,000 compounds, the proposed method was 36,900 times faster in CPU time and 12,000 times as efficient in communication size compared with general purpose multi-party computation.

Based on these and recent (2013) observations in the contiguous Rio Nunez estuary, we propose a single 'Guineas stock', combining the former 'Canal do Jeba-Bijagos' and South Guinea stocks. Significant mortality of S. teuszii from fisheries interactions is widely recognised however not quantifiable as monitoring effort is sporadic. In Guinea, catches were documented in 2002 (n=1) and in 2011-12 (n=5). Landed specimens were recorded in Cameroon (n=2) and Nigeria (n=2). All individuals were killed in small-scale coastal fisheries, presumably as accidental net entanglements, though directed takes cannot be excluded. All landed dolphins were butchered for human consumption (marine bushmeat). Nigerian fishers indicated also an alternative use as shark bait. If local markets in cetacean bushmeat and bait develop, as in Ghana, that will exacerbate pressures by encouraging directed takes. Catch records in Nigeria and sightings in Togo authenticate both nations as (long-suspected) range states for S. teuszii, a belated documenting of the primary, historical distribution. The Gulf of Guinea stock ('Cameroon dolphins') extends at least from Togo to southern Cameroon, and probably into Equatorial Guinea. However, rare sightings of small groups point to remnant, not thriving, dolphin communities. We anticipate de novo distribution gaps emerging and consolidating, following decades of fisheries interactions and creeping encroachment on once pristine coastal habitat. Developed coastlines in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire devoid of records may already constitute such gaps. As the lack or scarcity of records warn about formidable challenges to the long-term survival of S. teuszii, innovative, workable protection measures are needed, soonest. We recommend the implementation of several new border-straddling marine protected areas (cf. Saloum Delta-Niumi National Park Complex) which could bring forth a major conservation effect. Binational involvement bears obvious advantages, from sharing responsibilities and allowing for larger protected areas.

In mammalian cells, H2Bub1 levels are highly correlated with transcription elongation rates, consistent with the general belief that H2Bub1 facilitates the elongation process. Yet, a causative role of H2Bub1 in regulating elongation rates within live cells remains to be proven. Using our recently developed 4sUDRB-seq method, we examined the impact of H2Bub1 downregulation, through silencing of its cognate E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20, on genomewide transcription elongation rates. Surprisingly, H2Bub1 downregulation had no measurable effect on global elongation rates. Instead, it led to upregulation of over 1,000 genes by altering their Pol II pause release times; notably, those genes are characterized by the presence of H2Bub1 in relatively close proximity to the paused Pol II. Conversely, another set of genes was downregulated upon partial H2Bub1 depletion, and in those genes H2Bub1 appeared to be required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to the promoter region. Overall, our data shed new light on the molecular mechanisms by which H2Bub1 regulates gene expression and imply that the role of H2Bub1 in transcription elongation should be reconsidered.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print988.pdf,"[( 27 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 26 Dec 2015 , 5)]"

Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered the adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from birth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among genetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic component in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder principle, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically expressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division time is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a fixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean cell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in timing increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the distribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is independent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in experimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to different newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides further insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions of the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective means become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various modifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder principle. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental findings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations in cell-division timing for size control.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print991.pdf,"[( 27 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 24 Dec 2015 , 2), ( 25 Dec 2015 , 3), ( 04 Jan 2016 , 1)]"

Despite the extensive exploration into vertebrate genomes, in many model objects the ribosomal cluster structure is still underinvestigated. So far, complete description for primary structure of avian ribosomal cluster has not  been reported. 
Results: This work represents the first successful assembly of complete chicken ribosome cluster sequence. The sequence was deposited to GenBank under accession number KT445934. The total cluster size from pre-rRNA transcriptional start site to the 3′ end of 3′ETS amounted to 11444 bp. 18S rRNA gene size is 1823 base pairs, 5.8S rRNA - 157 bp, 28S rRNA - 4443 bp. The 5′ETS spacer core size is 1839 bp, 3′ETS - about 350 bp., ITS1 - 2099 bp, and ITS2 - 733 bp. The assembly was validated through in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) analysis on metaphase chromosomes of chicken.

Nevertheless, designing high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging. We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine control of how motifs are placed into sequences therefore allowing the user to investigate the rules that govern TF occupancy. MPRA SNP design can be used to investigate the functional effects of single or combinations of SNPs at regulatory sequences.

These models include the logistic, Gompertz, exponential, critical exponential, linear+exponential, Gaussian and linear functions. The fitted parameters from these models reflect aspects of the model shape, and thus allowed for the interpretation of gene expression profiles in terms of the underlying biology, such as the time of initial gene expression. This provides a potentially more mechanistic ap-proach to studying the genetic responses to stimuli. Together with a cluster analysis, termed ShapeCluster, it was possible to group genes based on these aspects of the expression profiles. By investigating different combinations of parameters, this added flexibility to the analysis and allowed for the investigation of the data in multiple ways, including the identification of groups of genes that may be co-regulated, or participate in response to the biological stress in question.

Williams' idea that evolutionary constraints prevent asexual mutants from arising more frequently in low fecundity organisms, like mammals and birds, with an earlier one by David Lack that the brood size of these organisms has an optimum, and producing larger broods reduces their fitness, leads to a novel hypothesis about the maintenance of sex in them. All else equal, the eggs of an asexual mutant female should simply start developing without fertilisation, and there is no reason to assume that they would stop doing so after the optimal number of offspring has been produced. Without a way to control their reproductive output, asexual mutants should over-reproduce and suffer a cost of doing so. Experimental studies suggest that the cost of enlarged broods could limit the advantage of asexual mutants considerably. Moreover, research discovered that increased reproductive effort reduces immune functions of low fecundity organisms. This offers a surprising synthesis between Williams' constraint and Hamilton's parasite hypothesis on maintaining sex in low fecundity organisms: Compromised immune functions of asexual hosts may render them susceptible rather than adaptation on the side of parasites to overcome host resistance.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1000.pdf,"[( 02 Jan 2016 , 4)]"
"January 1, 2016",Frequency Transformations and Spectral Gaps in Cochlear Implant Processing,Pre print,"[(Jacobson, Barry David,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/035824 ,"In previous work we created a mathematical model and identified a major source of distortion in Cochlear Implant(CI) processing which manifests itself in three forms, all of which are due to the nonlinear envelope processing algorithms which are widely used in some form or another in many current models. The first are spectral gaps or dead zones within the claimed frequency coverage range. This means that there exist regions of the spectrum for which there is no possible input that can produce an output at those frequencies. The second are frequency transformations which convert input tones of one frequency to tones of another frequency. Because this is a many-to-one transformation, it renders following a melody impossible, as the fundamental frequency of two different notes may be mapped to the same output frequency. This makes them impossible to distinguish, (although there may be differences in higher order harmonics that we will discuss). The third type of distortion are intermodulation products between input tones which yield additional output tones that were not present in either input. In the case of multiple talkers, these will compound the comprehension difficulty, as not only are the original spectral components of each speaker transformed, but additional nonexistent components have been added into the mix. This accounts for the great difficulty of CI users in noise.

In this work, we extend our earlier work in three ways. First, we clarify our description of spectral gaps which a number of readers pointed out was unclear, in that it implied that certain input tones will produce no response at all. In fact, all input tones will produce a response, but in most cases, the output will be frequency-transformed to a different frequency which the CI is capable of producing. Second, we graphically illustrate the input/output frequency transformation, so that the reader can clearly see at a glance how each frequency is altered. The form of this transformation is a staircase over most of the usable range, meaning that for single, pure tones all frequencies in the passband of a particular channel are mapped to a single frequency--the center frequency of that channel. As frequency continues to increase, all frequencies in the passband of the next channel become mapped to the center frequency of that channel, and so on. The exception is in the low frequencies, for reasons that we discuss. Third, in our earlier work we analyzed the simple case of only two pure tones within a single channel. Here we extend to the more realistic case of mixtures of complex tones, such as musical notes or the vowels of speech which may each have multiple harmonics extending throughout much of the audible frequency range. We find that, as expected, the output components of a source within a single channel often clash (are dissonant) with each other, and with those output components of that source (higher harmonics) which fall within other channels. So that instead of there being a harmonic or integral relationship among the output spectral components of each source, these components are no longer related to each other harmonically as they were at the input, thus producing a dissonant and grating percept. Furthermore, in the case two or more complex tones, additional intermodulation components are produced that further distort the sound. All these assertions are derived from theoretical considerations, and also noted from the author's own listening experience, and further confirmed from correspondence with other CI users.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1001.pdf,"[( 02 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

Clinical trials in stroke have not evaluated how initial pharmacological thrombolytic management might influence subsequent rescue strategy. A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a novel trial design that can test these dynamic treatment regimens and lead to treatment guidelines which more closely mimic practice.
Aim: To characterize a SMART design in comparison to traditional approaches for stroke reperfusion trials. 
Methods: We conducted a numerical simulation study that evaluated the performance of contrasting acute stroke clinical trial designs of both initial reperfusion and rescue therapy. We compare a SMART design where the same patients are followed through initial reperfusion and rescue therapy within one trial to a standard phase III design comparing two reperfusion treatments and a separate phase II futility design of rescue therapy in terms of sample size, power, and ability to address particular research questions.
Results: Traditional trial designs can be well powered and have optimal design characteristics for independent treatment effects. When treatments, such as the reperfusion and rescue therapies, may interact, commonly used designs fail to detect this. A SMART design, with similar sample size to standard designs, can detect treatment interactions.

These questions are technically challenging due to the large model and parameter spaces that must be efficiently explored. Here we use a measure of robustness that coincides with the Bayesian model evidence combined with an efficient Monte Carlo method to traverse model space and concentrate on regions of high robustness, which enables the accurate evaluation of the relative structural robustness of gene network models governed by stochastic dynamics. We report the most robust two and three gene oscillator systems, plus examine how the number of interactions, the presence of auto-regulation, and degradation of mRNA and protein affects the frequency, amplitude and robustness of transcriptional oscillators. We also find that there is a limit to parametric robustness, beyond which there is nothing to be gained by adding additional feedback. Importantly, we provide predictions on new oscillator systems that can be constructed to verify the theory and advance design and modelling approaches to systems and synthetic biology.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/ACS Synthetic Biology/ACS Synthetic Biology9.pdf,"[( 05 Jan 2016 , 3), ( 20 Oct 2015 , 1), ( 20 Aug 2015 , 2), ( 21 Aug 2015 , 2), ( 29 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 09 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 19 Oct 2015 , 3)]"

The common ancestry of life is supported by an enormous body of evidence and is universally accepted within the scientific community. However, some potential sources of data that can be used to test the thesis of common ancestry have not yet been formally analyzed. 
2. We developed a new test of common ancestry based on nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites in aligned homologous protein coding genes. We reasoned that since nucleotide variation at amino acid invariant sites is selectively neutral and, thus, unlikely to be due to convergent evolution, the observation that an amino acid is consistently encoded by the same codon sequence in different species could provide strong evidence of their common ancestry. Our method uses the observed variation in codon sequences at amino acid invariant sites as a test statistic, and compares such variation to that which is expected under three different models of codon frequency under the alternative hypothesis of separate ancestry. We also examine hierarchical structure in the nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites and quantified agreement between trees generated from amino acid sequence and those inferred from the nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites. 
3. When these tests are applied to the primate families as a test case, we find that observed nucleotide variation at amino acid invariant sites is considerably lower than nucleotide variation predicted by any model of codon frequency under separate ancestry. Phylogenetic trees generated from amino-acid invariant site nucleotide data agree with those generated from protein-coding data, and there is far more hierarchical structure in amino-acid invariant site data than would be expected under separate ancestry.
4. We definitively reject the separate ancestry of the primate families, and demonstrate that our tests can be applied to any group of interest to test common ancestry.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1006.pdf,"[( 05 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 04 Jan 2016 , 7), ( 06 Jan 2016 , 2), ( 10 Nov 2016 , 1)]"

These potential P. tremula-specific SNPs were displayed as a whole-plastome barcode on the P. tremula W52 chloroplast DNA sequence. Three of these SNPs and one InDel in the trnH-psbA linker were successfully validated by Sanger sequencing in an extended set of Populus individuals. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of P. tremula is the first in the family of Salicaceae.

Results. We have developed a command-line computational pipeline (available at https://bitbucket.org/qmentis/clusterscluster/) that assists in performing empirical (genome-based) assessment of microbial secondary metabolite gene clusters similarity and abundance, and applied it to a set of 208 complete and de-duplicated Actinobacteria genomes.

Biallelic inactivating mutations in TBCK (TBC1 domain-containing kinase) were independently identified by Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) as the cause of this condition in four unrelated families. Matching these families was facilitated by sharing phenotypic profiles and WES data in a recently released web-based tool (Geno2MP) that links phenotypic information to rare variants in families with Mendelian traits. TBCK is a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for small GTPases of the Rab family and has been shown to control cell growth and proliferation, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and mTOR signaling. Two of the three mutations are predicted to truncate the protein (c.376C>T [p.Arg126*] and c.1363A>T [p.Lys455*]), and loss of the major TBCK isoform was confirmed in primary fibroblasts from one affected individual. The third mutation, c.1532G>A [p.Arg511His], alters a conserved residue within the TBC1 domain. Structural analysis implicates Arg511 as a required residue for Rab-GAP function, and in silico homology modeling predicts impaired GAP function in the corresponding mutant.

We construct an evolutionary model where individuals have a memory with limited storage capacity, and an evolving trait determines the fraction of that memory that should be allocated to innate responses to the environment versus learning these responses.

While recent work has proposed a role for episodes in decision making, it is largely unknown whether and how episodic experiences contribute to value-based decision making and how the values of single episodes are represented in the brain. In multiple behavioral experiments and an fMRI experiment, we tested whether and how rewarding episodes could support later decision making. Participants experienced episodes of high reward or low reward in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In a surprise test phase, we found that participants could indeed remember the associated level of reward, as evidenced by accurate source memory for value and preferences to re-engage with rewarded objects. Further, in a separate experiment, we found that high reward objects shown as primes before a gambling task increased financial risk-taking. Neurally, re-exposure to objects in the test phase led to significant reactivation of reward-related patterns. Importantly, individual variability in the strength of reactivation predicted value memory performance. Further, local searchlight analyses identified significant reactivation in the ventromedial PFC.

We report three major findings. First, we find that this nab regulatory belt is a novel enhancer driving dorsal wing margin expression in regions of peak phosphorylated-Mad in wing imaginal discs. Second, we show that Ap is developmentally required to license the nab dorsal wing margin enhancer (DWME) to read-out Notch signaling in the dorsal wing compartment. Third, we find that the nab DWME is embedded in a complex of intronic enhancers, including a wing quadrant enhancer, a proximal wing disc enhancer, and a larval brain enhancer. This enhancer complex coordinates global nab expression via both tissue-specific activation and inter-enhancer silencing. We suggest that DWME integration of BMP signaling maintains nab expression in proliferating margin descendants that have divided away from Notch-Delta boundary signaling. As such, uniform expression of genes like nab and vestigial in proliferating compartments would typically require both boundary and non-boundary lineage-specific enhancers.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1012.pdf,"[( 07 Jan 2016 , 3), ( 06 Jan 2016 , 3)]"

Triple helices are formed by a single stranded RNA/DNA molecule, which binds to the major groove of a double helix following a canonical code. Recently, sequence analysis methods have been proposed to detect triple helices for a given RNA and DNA sequences. We propose the Triplex Domain Finder (TDF) to detect DNA binding domains in RNA molecules. For a candidate lncRNA and potential target DNA regions, i.e. promoter of genes differentially regulated after the knockdown of the lncRNA, TDF evaluates whether particular RNA regions are likely to form DNA binding domains (DBD). Moreover, the DNA binding sites from the predicted DBDs are used to indicate potential target DNA regions, i.e. genes with high binding site coverage in their promoter. The command line tool provides results on a user friendly and graphical html interface. A case study on FENDRR, an lncRNA known to form triple helices, demonstrates that TDF is able to recover both previously discovered DBDs and DNA binding sites.

For example, Toxoplasma gondii manipulates the behaviour of infected rodents to aid transmission to cats and parasitic trematodes of the genus Ribeiroia alter limb development in their amphibian hosts to facilitate predation by birds. Plant parasites and pathogens also reprogram host development and morphology. Phytoplasma parasites of plants induce extensive leaf-like flower phenotype (phyllody) in their host plants, presumably to attract insect vectors on which these bacteria depend for transmission. However, it remains debatable whether morphological phenotypes, such as phyllody, are directly beneficial to the parasites or are side-products of parasite infection. Previously, we found that phytoplasma virulence protein (effector) SAP54 binds and mediates degradation of host MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs), regulatory hubs of plant development and hormone physiology, to induce phyllody and promote insect vector colonisation. Here we show that plants heterologously expressing SAP54 are strongly attractive to insects, but surprisingly, insect attraction was independent of the presence of leaf-like flowers. Moreover, plants that produce leaf-like flowers in the absence of SAP54 did not attract insects. We conclude that the SAP54 effector mediates insect vector attraction in host plants by exploiting the role of its MTF targets in insect defence and that perturbation of floral development may be a secondary effect of the effector activity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Plant Science/Frontiers in Plant Science2.pdf,"[( 22 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 07 Jan 2016 , 4), ( 15 Jan 2016 , 3)]"

In enChIP-Seq, the target genomic region is captured by an engineered DNA-binding complex, such as a CRISPR system consisting of a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Subsequently, the genomic regions that physically interact with the target genomic region in the captured complex are sequenced by NGS. Using enChIP-Seq, we found that the 5'HS5 locus, which regulates expression of the β-globin genes, interacts with multiple genomic regions upon erythroid differentiation in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Genes near the genomic regions inducibly associated with the 5'HS5 locus were transcriptionally up-regulated in the differentiated state, suggesting the existence of a coordinated transcription mechanism directly or indirectly mediated by physical interactions between these loci.

However, they can only be applied to rather small samples, which limits their ability to estimate recent population size history. Besides, they can be very sensitive to sequencing or phasing errors. Here we introduce a new approximate Bayesian computation approach named PopSizeABC that allows estimating the evolution of the effective population size through time, using a large sample of complete genomes. This sample is summarized using the folded allele frequency spectrum and the average zygotic linkage disequilibrium at different bins of physical distance, two classes of statistics that are widely used in population genetics and can be easily computed from unphased and unpolarized SNP data.

Using data generated by these transcriptomic assays requires measurement assurance with appropriate controls. Methods to prototype and evaluate multiple RNA controls were developed as part of the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) assessment process.  These approaches included a modified Latin square design to provide a broad dynamic range of relative abundance with known differences between four complex mixtures of ERCC RNA transcripts spiked into a human liver total RNA background.

RESULTS:  ERCC mixtures were analyzed on four different microarray platforms: Agilent 1- and 2-color, Illumina bead, and NIAID lab-made spotted microarrays; and two different second-generation sequencing platforms: the Life Technologies 5500xl and the Illumina HiSeq 2500.  Individual ERCCs were assessed for reproducible performance in signal response to concentration among the platforms.  Most demonstrated linear behavior if they were not located near one of the extremes of the dynamic range.  Performance issues with any individual ERCC transcript could be attributed to detection limitations, platform-specific target probe issues, or potential mixing errors.  Collectively, these mixtures of spike-in RNA controls were evaluated for suitability as surrogates for endogenous transcripts to interrogate the performance of the RNA measurement process of each platform.  The controls were useful for establishing the dynamic range of the assay, as well as delineating the useable region of that range where differential expression measurements, expressed as ratios, would be expected to be accurate.  

CONCLUSIONS:  The modified Latin square design presented here uses a composite testing scheme for the evaluation of multiple performance characteristics: linear performance of individual controls, signal response within dynamic range pools of controls, and ratio detection between pairs of dynamic range pools.  This compact design provides an economical sample format for the evaluation of multiple external RNA controls within a single experiment per platform.

This pathogen is commonly found in the western U.S.; however, recently the disease was also detected in several eastern states where the black walnut lumber industry is concentrated. G. morbida is one of two known phytopathogens within the genus Geosmithia, and it is vectored into the host tree via the walnut twig beetle. 
Results: We present the first de novo draft genome of G. morbida. It is 26.5 Mbp in length and contains less than 1% repetitive elements. The genome possesses an estimated 6,273 genes, 277 of which are predicted to encode proteins with unknown functions. Approximately 31.5% of the proteins in G. morbida are homologous to proteins involved in pathogenicity, and 5.6% of the proteins contain signal peptides that indicate these proteins are secreted.   
Conclusions: Several studies have investigated the evolution of pathogenicity in pathogens of agricultural crops; forest fungal pathogens are often neglected because research efforts are focused on food crops. G. morbida is one of the few tree phytopathogens to be sequenced, assembled and annotated. The first draft genome of G. morbida serves as a valuable tool for comprehending the underlying molecular and evolutionary mechanisms behind pathogenesis within the Geosmithia genus.

Here we show how the broadband power spectrum of field potential recordings can be explained by a simple random network of nodes near criticality. Such a recurrent network produces activity with a combination of a fast and a slow autocorrelation time constant, with the fast mode corresponding to local dynamics and the slow mode resulting from recurrent excitatory connections across the network. These modes are combined to produce a power spectrum similar to that observed in human intracranial EEG (i.e., electrocorticography, ECoG) recordings. Moreover, such a network naturally converts input correlations across nodes into temporal autocorrelation of the network activity. Consequently, increased independence between nodes results in a reduction in low-frequency power, which offers a possible explanation for observed changes in ECoG power spectra during task performance. Lastly, changes in network coupling produce changes in network activity power spectra reminiscent of those seen in human ECoG recordings across different arousal states. This model thus links macroscopic features of the empirical ECoG power spectrum to a parsimonious underlying network structure and proposes potential mechanisms for changes in ECoG power spectra observed across behavioral and arousal states. This provides a computational framework within which to generate and test hypotheses about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying whole brain electrical dynamics, their variations across behavioral states as well as abnormalities associated with brain diseases.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Cerebral Cortex/Cerebral Cortex2.pdf,"[( 08 Jan 2016 , 3)]"

Experimental data strongly suggest that local recurrent connectivity in the cortex is significantly non-random, exhibiting, for example, above-chance bidirectionality and an overrepresentation of certain triangular motifs. Additional evidence suggests a significant distance dependency to connectivity over a local scale of a few hundred microns, and particular patterns of synaptic turnover dynamics, including a heavy-tailed distribution of synaptic efficacies, a power law distribution of synaptic lifetimes, and a tendency for stronger synapses to be more stable over time. Understanding how many of these non-random features simultaneously arise would provide valuable insights into the development and function of the cortex. While previous work has modeled some of the individual features of local cortical wiring, there is no model that begins to comprehensively account for all of them. We present a spiking network model of a rodent Layer 5 cortical slice which, via the interactions of a few simple biologically motivated intrinsic, synaptic, and structural plasticity mechanisms, qualitatively reproduces these non-random effects when combined with simple topological constraints.

One route to understanding the primary pathological cell type for a particular disease is to identify the cells expressing susceptibility genes. Although this is straightforward for monogenic conditions where the causative mutation may alter expression of a cell type specific marker, methods are required for the common polygenic disorders. We developed the Expression Weighted Cell Type Enrichment (EWCE) method that uses single cell transcriptomes to generate the probability distribution associated with a gene list having an average level of expression within a cell type. Following validation, we applied EWCE to human genetic data from cases of epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Autism, Intellectual Disability, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and anxiety disorders. Genetic susceptibility primarily affected microglia in Alzheimer's and Multiple Sclerosis; was shared between interneurons and pyramidal neurons in Autism and Schizophrenia; while intellectual disabilities and epilepsy were attributable to a range of cell-types, with the strongest enrichment in interneurons. We hypothesized that the primary cell type pathology could trigger secondary changes in other cell types and these could be detected by applying EWCE to transcriptome data from diseased tissue. In Autism, Schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease we find evidence of pathological changes in all of the major brain cell types.

If population structure 𝒮1 is greater than population structure 𝒮2 in the containment or the volume order, then 𝒮1 can be considered a stronger promoter of cooperation.

Among mammals, it is well known that there exists substantial variation in yearly substitution rates. Such variation is to be expected from differences in life-history traits, suggesting that it should also be found among primates. Motivated by these considerations, we analyze whole genomes from ten primate species, including Old World Monkeys (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs) and apes, focusing on putatively neutral autosomal sites and controlling for possible effects of biased gene conversion and methylation at CpG sites. We find that substitution rates are ~65% higher in lineages leading from the hominoid-NWM ancestor to NWMs than to apes. Within apes, rates are ~2% higher in chimpanzees and ~7% higher in the gorilla than in humans. Substitution types subject to biased gene conversion show no more variation among species than those not subject to it. Not all mutation types behave similarly, however: in particular, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more clock-like behavior than do other types, presumably due to their non-replicative origin. Thus, not only the total rate, but also the mutational spectrum varies among primates. This finding suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated using CpG transitions. Taking this approach, we estimate that the average time to the most recent common ancestor of human and chimpanzee is 12.1 million years and their split time 7.9 million years.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PNAS/PNAS32.pdf,"[( 16 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jan 2016 , 8), ( 26 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 21 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 12 Jan 2016 , 32), ( 13 May 2016 , 3), ( 19 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 13 Jan 2016 , 17)]"

However, standard RNAseq methods (e.g., Illumina TruSeq® or NEBNext®) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, RNAseq is often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost RNAseq methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard mRNAseq is costly partly because one sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such whole-mRNA data is redundant for estimates of relative gene expression. TagSeq is an alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on mRNAs 3-prime end, thereby reducing the necessary sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. Here we present a revised TagSeq protocol, and compare its performance against NEBNext®, the gold-standard whole mRNAseq method. We built both TagSeq and NEBNext® libraries from the same biological samples, each spiked with control RNAs. We found that TagSeq measured the control RNA distribution more accurately than NEBNext®, for a fraction of the cost per sample (~10%). The higher accuracy of TagSeq was particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low abundance.

Drug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains. Results. The P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens.

Results: Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run.

activity of individual cells. We find that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology48.pdf,"[( 21 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 18 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 28 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 13 Jan 2016 , 5)]"

Although nervous systems are diverse across phyla, many taxa have a larva that forms an anterior concentration of neurons, or apical organ.  The number of neurons in these organs is highly variable. We show that neurogenesis in the sea star larvae begins with soxc-expressing multipotent progenitors.  These give rise to restricted progenitors that express lhx2/9.  Soxc- and lhx2/9-expressing cells are capable of undergoing both asymmetric divisions, which allow for progression towards a particular neural fate, and symmetric proliferative divisions.  Nested concentric domains of gene expression along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, which have been observed in a great diversity of metazoans, control neurogenesis in the sea star by promoting particular division modes and progression towards becoming a neuron. This work, therefore, explains how spatial patterning in the ectoderm controls progression of neurogenesis.

In contrast, much debate but little empirical evidence addresses whether ""selfish"" genes are capable of fixation -- thereby leaving signatures identical to classical selective sweeps -- despite being neutral or deleterious to organismal fitness. We previously reported the discovery of R2d2, a large copy-number variant that causes non-random segregation of mouse Chromosome 2 in females due to meiotic drive.

We find that R2d2HC rapidly increases in frequency, and in most cases becomes fixed in significantly fewer generations than can be explained by genetic drift. R2d2HC is also associated with significantly reduced litter sizes in heterozygosity, making it a true selfish allele. Our data provide direct evidence of populations actively undergoing selfish sweeps, and demonstrate that meiotic drive can rapidly alter the genomic landscape in favor of mutations with neutral or even negative effects on overall Darwinian fitness.

Neural network layers developed representations that corresponded in a hierarchical consistent fashion to visual areas from V1 to LOC.

We apply our new estimator to ultra large-scale GWAS summary data of 30 common traits and diseases to gain insights into their local genetic architecture. First, we find that common SNPs have a high contribution to the heritability of all studied traits.

Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers -- some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. 
Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program -- making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management.
Results & Conclusions. There was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.

Reads from paired-end and mate-pair libraries are often utilized to find structural variation in genomes, and one common approach is to use their fragment length for detection. After aligning read-pairs to the reference, read-pair distances are analyzed for statistically significant deviations. However, previously proposed methods are based on a simplified model of observed fragment lengths that does not agree with data. We show how this model limits statistical analysis of identifying variants and propose a new model, by adapting a model we have previously introduced for contig scaffolding, which agrees with data. From this model we derive an improved improved null hypothesis that, when applied in the variant caller CLEVER, reduces the number of false positives and corrects a bias that contributes to more deletion calls than insertion calls.

 Currently quantitative RNA-Seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require PCR amplification to generate libraries.
However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this effects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. 
To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. 
Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates that are bound to occur for highly transcribed RNAs.
Hence, it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads and how important it is to reduce PCR amplification experimentally.
Here, we generate and analyse RNA-Seq datasets that were prepared with three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). 
We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias.
Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does not improve accuracy, power or false discovery rates, but can actually worsen them. 
Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and false discovery rate are only mildly improved. 
However, we do find that power does improve with fewer PCR amplification cycles across datasets and that early barcoding of samples and hence PCR amplification in one reaction can restore this loss of power.
Conclusions
Computational removal of read duplicates is not recommended for differential expression analysis. 
However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports47.pdf,"[( 30 Dec 2015 , 7), ( 23 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 17 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 08 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 05 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 09 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 28 Dec 2015 , 11), ( 03 Jan 2016 , 2), ( 14 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 29 Dec 2015 , 56), ( 31 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 25 Jan 2016 , 2), ( 07 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 01 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 15 Jan 2016 , 2)]"

A total of 114 alpine lakes in the central Pyrenees were surveyed to evaluate the functional connectivity between catchment physical and ecological elements and littoral zoobenthos, and ascertain their effect on community formation. At each lake, the zoobenthic composition was assessed together with geolocation (altitude, latitude and longitude), catchment hydrodynamics, geomorphology, topography, riparian vegetation composition, the presence of trout and frogs, water pH and conductivity.
Uni- and multidimensional fuzzy set ordination models integrating benthic biota and environmental variables revealed that at geographical scale longitude surpassed altitude in its effect on the littoral ecosystem, reflecting a sharp transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean bioregions. Topography (through its control of catchment type, summer snow coverage, and connectivity with other lakes) was the largest catchment-scale driver, followed by hydrodynamics (waterbody size, type and inflow/outflow volumes). Locally, riparian plant composition significantly related to littoral community structure, richness and morphotype diversity. These variables, directly and indirectly, create habitats for aquatic and terrestrial stages of invertebrates, and control nutrient and water cycles. Three ecologically diverse associations characterised distinct lake sets. Vertebrate predation, water conductivity and pH (broad measures of total dissolved ions/nutrients and their bioavailability) had no major influence on littoral taxa.

We investigated the possible neural dynamics underlying the role of dlPFC in perceptual decision making, through a combination of noninvasive neurostimulation in humans and computational modeling. First, we used an established and biophysically realistic model of a decision making network that employs competition between neural populations. Simulation of depolarizing noninvasive brain stimulation in this model decreased decision time, while hyperpolarizing stimulation increased it. This behavioral effect was caused by an increase in the rate of neural activity integration via recurrent connections, as well as changes in the susceptibility of the network to noisy background inputs which modulated population firing rate differences prior to the onset of the stimulus. These pre-stimulus differences biased the response to one or the other option, thus speeding or slowing decisions.
We then tested these model predictions in healthy participants performing a perceptual decision making task while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dlPFC, analogous to our simulated network stimulation. We found a striking match between model predictions and experimental results: depolarizing (inward) currents reduced and hyperpolarizing (outward) currents increased response times, but accuracy remained unaffected. Our results provide interventional evidence for the role of left dlPFC in perceptual decision making, and suggest that this region integrates and compares sensory evidence through competitive interactions between pyramidal cell populations which are selective for each response option. Mechanistically, our model suggests that stimulation of this region changes the rate at which evidence can be accumulated through recurrent activity and its susceptibility to background noise.

We devised a novel mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68 - 98 days] on average.

Here, we study the allometry of adhesive pad area in 225 climbing animal species, covering more than seven orders of magnitude in weight. Across all taxa, adhesive pad area showed extreme positive allometry and scaled with weight, implying a 200-fold increase of relative pad area from mites to geckos. However, allometric scaling coefficients for pad area systematically decreased with taxonomic level, and were close to isometry when evolutionary history was accounted for, indicating that the substantial anatomical changes required to achieve increases in relative pad area are limited by phylogenetic constraints. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found that the departure from isometry is almost exclusively caused by large differences in size-corrected pad area between arthropods and vertebrates. To mitigate the expected decrease of weight-specific adhesion within closely related taxa where pad area scaled close to isometry, data for several taxa suggest that the pads' adhesive strength increased for larger animals. The combination of adjustments in relative pad area for distantly related taxa and changes in adhesive strength for closely related groups helps explain how climbing with adhesive pads has evolved in animals varying over seven orders of magnitude in body weight.

A cell's epigenome arises from interactions among regulatory factors --- transcription factors, histone modifications, and other DNA-associated proteins --- co-localized at particular genomic regions. Identifying the network of interactions among regulatory factors, the chromatin network, is of paramount importance in understanding epigenome regulation.

Methods:
We developed a novel computational approach, ChromNet, to infer the chromatin network from a set of ChIP-seq datasets. ChromNet has four key features that enable its use on large collections of ChIP-seq data. First, rather than using pairwise co-localization of factors along the genome, ChromNet identifies conditional dependence relationships that better discriminate direct and indirect interactions. Second, our novel statistical technique, the group graphical model, improves inference of conditional dependence on highly correlated datasets. Such datasets are common because some transcription factors form a complex and the same transcription factor is often assayed in different laboratories or cell types. Third, ChromNet's computationally efficient method and the group graphical model enable the learning of a joint network across all cell types, which greatly increases the scope of possible interactions. We have shown that this results in a significantly higher fold enrichment for validated protein interactions. Fourth, ChromNet provides an efficient way to identify the genomic context that drives a particular network edge, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of regulatory factor interactions.

Results:
We applied ChromNet to all available ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Project, consisting of 1451 ChIP-seq datasets, which revealed previously known physical interactions better than alternative approaches. ChromNet also identified previously unreported regulatory factor interactions. We experimentally validated one of these interactions, between the MYC and HCFC1 transcription factors.

Discussion:
ChromNet provides a useful tool for understanding the interactions among regulatory factors and identifying novel interactions.

For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative datasets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum-likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity- dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution.

When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis.

Results: We introduce a novel concept,  quasi-mapping,  and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap --- our tool implementing quasi-mapping --- is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we employ to implement quasi-mapping  uses  several  efficient  data  structures  and  takes  advantage  of  the  special  structure  of shared  sequence  prevalent  in  transcriptomes  to  rapidly  provide  highly-accurate  mapping  information.

We found that amendment with labile protein plus phosphorus increased remineralization rates of degraded, phytoplankton-derived OM by up to 100%, whereas acetate slightly decreased remineralization rates relative to an unamended control. Addition of ammonium and phosphate induced a smaller effect, whereas addition of ammonium alone had no effect. Counterintuitively, alkaline phosphatase activities increased in response to the addition of protein under P-replete conditions, indicating that production of enzymes unrelated to the labile priming compound may be a mechanism for the priming effect. The observed priming effect was transient: after 36 days of incubation roughly the same quantity of organic carbon had been mineralized in all treatments including no-addition controls.

SPARC regulates numerous cellular processes including integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell signaling pathways, and extracellular matrix assembly; however, the mechanism by which SPARC promotes cell invasion in vivo remains unclear. A main obstacle in understanding SPARC function has been the difficulty of visualizing and experimentally examining the dynamic interactions between invasive cells, extracellular matrix and SPARC in native tissue environments.  Using the model of anchor cell invasion through the basement membrane (BM) extracellular matrix in Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that SPARC overexpression is highly pro-invasive and rescues BM transmigration in mutants with defects in diverse aspects of invasion, including cell polarity, invadopodia formation, and matrix metalloproteinase expression.  By examining BM assembly, we find that overexpression of SPARC specifically decreases levels of BM type IV collagen, a crucial structural BM component.  Reduction of type IV collagen mimicked SPARC overexpression and was sufficient to promote invasion. Tissue-specific overexpression and photobleaching experiments revealed that SPARC acts extracellularly to inhibit collagen incorporation into BM. By reducing endogenous SPARC, we also found that SPARC functions normally to traffic collagen from its site of synthesis to tissues that do not express collagen. We propose that a surplus of SPARC disrupts extracellular collagen trafficking and reduces BM collagen incorporation, thus weakening the BM barrier and dramatically enhancing its ability to be breached by invasive cells.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics56.pdf,"[( 20 Jan 2016 , 4)]"

Recombination rates vary substantially across taxa and the distribution of crossovers can differ significantly among populations and between sexes. Crossover locations within species have been found to vary by chromosome and by position within chromosomes, where most crossover events occur in small regions known as recombination hotspots. However, several species appear to lack hotspots despite significant crossover heterogeneity. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was previously found to have the least fine-scale variation in crossover distribution among organisms studied to date.  It is unclear whether this pattern extends to the X chromosome given its unique compaction through the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase in hermaphrodites. We generated 798 recombinant nested near-isogenic lines (NILs) with crossovers in a 1.41 Mb region on the left arm of the X chromosome to determine if its recombination landscape is similar to that of the autosomes. We find that the fine-scale variation in crossover rate is lower than that of other model species and is inconsistent with hotspots. The relationship of genomic features to crossover rate is dependent on scale, with GC content, histone modifications, and nucleosome occupancy being negatively associated with crossovers.

By generating proteomics data and using tRNA sequence comparisons we show that in Pachysolen CUG codons are translated as alanine and not as the universal leucine. The polyphyly of the CUG-
decoding tRNAs in yeasts is best explained by a tRNA loss driven codon reassignment mechanism. Loss of the CUG-tRNA in the ancient yeast is followed by gradual
decrease of respective codons and subsequent codon capture by tRNAs whose anticodon is outside the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase recognition region. Our
hypothesis applies to all nuclear genetic code alterations and provides several testable predictions. We anticipate more codon reassignments to be uncovered in existing and upcoming genome projects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research30.pdf,"[( 20 Jan 2016 , 10)]"

Here, we ascertain uninvadability (all mutant strategies always go extinct) in terms of the growth rate of a mutant allele arising as a single copy in a population. We show from this growth rate that uninvadability is equivalently characterized by at least three conceptually distinct invasion fitness measures: (i) lineage fitness, giving the average personal fitness of a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; (ii) inclusive fitness, giving a reproductive value weighted average of the direct fitness cost and relatedness weighted indirect fitness benefits accruing to a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; and (iii) three types of reproductive numbers, giving lifetime success of a local lineage.

The data consist of anatomical images, visualized as cortical meshes to highlight the sulcal and gyral patterns, and functional data obtained from retinotopic mapping experiments, visualized as eccentricity and angle maps on the cortical surface. 

Several features of the functional and anatomical data can be found across nearly all subjects and are helpful for identifying the location and extent of the hV4 map. The medial border of hV4 is shared with the posterior, ventral portion of V3, and is marked by a retinotopic representation of the upper vertical meridian. The anterior border of hV4 is shared with the VO-1 map, and falls on a retinotopic representation of the peripheral visual field, usually coincident with the posterior transverse collateral sulcus. The ventro-lateral edge of the map typically falls on the inferior occipital gyrus, where functional MRI artifacts often obscure the retinotopic data. Finally, we demonstrate the continuity of retinotopic parameters between hV4 and its neighbors; hV4 and V3v contain iso-eccentricity lines in register, whereas hV4 and VO-1 contain iso-polar angle lines in register.

Here we use a computational model to investigate an alternative possible function of stochastic phenotype switching - as a way to adapt more quickly even in a static environment. We show that when a genetic mutation causes a population to become less fit, switching to an alternative phenotype with higher fitness (growth rate) may give the population enough time to develop compensatory mutations that increase the fitness again. The possibility of switching phenotypes can reduce the time to adaptation by orders of magnitude if the “fitness valley” caused by the deleterious mutation is deep enough.

These reconstructions often are based on the observed relationships between the proportions of plant taxa in the source vegetation and the proportions of the corresponding pollen types in pollen assemblages collected from surface sediments. Pollen-vegetation models rely upon parameters whose values typically are assumed to be stable through time, but this assumption is largely unevaluated, due in part to the rarity of comprehensive forest data, particularly for earlier time periods.

Here we present a new dataset of early settlement-era pollen records for the upper Midwest of North America and combine it with three other pollen and forest composition datasets to assess the stability of the relationship between relative pollen composition and relative abundances of tree genera for two time periods: immediately prior to Euro-American settlement, and the late 20th Century. Over this time interval, Euro-American settlement resulted in widespread forest clearance for agriculture and logging, producing major changes to forest composition and structure and the pollen assemblages produced by these forests. These major changes provide an opportunity to test the constancy of the relationship between pollen and forest vegetation during a period of large vegetation change. Pollen-vegetation relationships are modeled, using a Generalized Linear Model, for thirteen upper Midwestern tree genera.

We find that estimates of pollen source radius for the gridded mesoscale data are 25-85 kilometers, consistent with prior studies. Pollen-vegetation relationships are significantly altered for several genera: Fagus, Betula, Tsuga, Quercus, Pinus, and Picea (p < 0.05). The use of contemporary pollen-vegetation relationships to model settlement era community composition significantly under-predicts the presence of Fagus, Betula, Tsuga, Quercus and Picea at all tree densities. Pinus is over-predicted at low relative proportions (<25%), but under-predicted at greater abundances. The divergence of pollen-vegetation relationships appears to be greatest for late-successional taxa characterized by high shade tolerance and low fire tolerance, although the statistical power is low for this analysis. 
Hence, the ongoing rapid changes in land use and ecological communities associated with the Anthropocene affect not just our ability to make confident ecological forecasts for the future, but can also modify our inferences about the past. In the Anthropocene era, which is characterized by its rapidly changing vegetation and climates, paleoecology must move from its traditional   reliance on spatial calibration datasets assumed to represent a single ""present"". Instead, when possible, paleoecologists should develop calibration datasets of pollen and forest composition that are distributed across major vegetation changes in time and space. 

Multitemporal calibration datasets are increasingly possible given the growing length and availability of vegetation observational data and will enable paleoecologists to better understand the complex processes governing pollen-vegetation relationships and make better-informed reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1038.pdf,"[( 25 Jan 2016 , 7), ( 19 Jan 2016 , 4)]"

Nuclear anisotropy is shown to be regulated by the cytoskeleton within intact cells, with actin and microtubules resistant to orthonormal strains. Importantly, nuclear anisotropy is intrinsic, and observed in isolated nuclei. The sensitivity of this behaviour is influenced by chromatin organization and lamin-A expression.

The higher levels of four trace elements (Na, K, Zn and Fe) in fertilized eggs and their lower levels in mated queens indicated that mated queens might transfer these trace elements to fertilized eggs to complete incubation. The higher levels of Mn, triglycerides and serotonin in mated queens and higher levels of Mn and glucose in fertilized eggs suggested that these substances are very important for normal ovarian and embryonic growth. The different expression of three reproductive genes (vtg1, rab11 and JHE1) suggested that they might be involved in the regulation of ovarian and embryonic growth.

The evolution of dispersal during range expansion increases invasion speed, provided that a species can adapt sufficiently fast to novel local conditions. Mutation rates can evolve too, under conditions that favor an increased rate of adaptation. However, evolution at the mutator gene has thus far been deemed of minor importance in sexual populations due to its dependence on genetic hitchhiking with a beneficial mutation at a gene under selection, and thus its sensitivity to recombination. Here we use an individual-based model to show that the mutator gene and the gene under selection can be effectively linked at the population level during invasion. This causes the evolutionary increase of mutation rates in sexual populations, even if they are not linked at the individual level. The observed evolution of mutation rate is adaptive and clearly advances range expansion both through its effect on the evolution of dispersal rate, and the evolution of local adaptation. In addition, we observe the evolution of mutation rates in a spatially stable population under strong directional selection, but not when we add variance to the mean selection pressure. By this we extend the existing theory on the evolution of mutation rates, which is generally thought to be limited to asexual populations, with possibly far-reaching consequences concerning invasiveness and the rate at which species can adapt to novel environmental conditions as experienced under global climate change.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Evolutionary Biology/BMC Evolutionary Biology7.pdf,"[( 29 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 06 Aug 2015 , 4), ( 07 Aug 2015 , 2), ( 25 Apr 2015 , 2), ( 15 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 28 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 30 Nov 2014 , 5), ( 12 Sep 2014 , 7), ( 24 Apr 2015 , 10), ( 20 Jan 2016 , 4)]"

We use the molecular transfer model (MTM), which is currently the only method that accomplishes this goal albeit phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of PDZ domain, which plays a significant role in molecular recognition and signaling. Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit a downward curvature at high urea concentrations ([C]s), which has been interpreted by invoking the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate.  Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) representation of PDZ2 are used to show that the intermediate (IEQ), which  has some native-like character, is present in equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap order parameter show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states. Structures of the transition state ensembles, (TSE1 separating the unfolded and (IEQ) and TSE2 separating IEQ and the native state), determined using the Pfold method, show that TSE1 is greatly expanded while TSE2 is compact and native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In one pathway folding occurs exclusively through I1, which resembles IEQ. In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs through a combination of I1 and a kinetic intermediate. We  establish that the radius of gyration (RUg) of the unfolded state is more compact (by ∼9%) under native conditions. Theory and simulations show that the decrease in RUg occurs on the time scale on the order of utmost ∼20 μs. The modest decrease in RUg and the rapid collapse suggest  that high spatial and temporal resolution, currently beyond the scope of most small angle X-ray scattering experiments, are needed to detect compaction in finite-sized proteins. The present work further establishes that MTM is efficacious in producing nearly quantitative predictions for folding of proteins under conditions used to carry out experiments.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/The Journal Of Physical Chemistry.

We implemented a novel meta-analytical method that yields identical power as pooled analyses without the need of sharing individual participant data. The efficiency of the framework is illustrated by associating 9 million genetic variants with 1.5 million brain imaging voxels in three cohorts (total N=4,034) followed by meta-analysis, on a standard computational infrastructure.

To this end, this work employs an emerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature, to quantify
the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood. In particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher curvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels.

We surveyed 30 methods and identified 12 features of the two sub-problems that distinguish methods from each other. We picked six methods (GEM, MACS2, MUSIC, BCP, TM and ZINBA) that span this feature space and used a combination of 300 simulated ChIP-seq data sets, 3 real data sets and mathematical analyses to identify features of methods that allow some to perform better than others. We prove that methods that explicitly combine the signals from ChIP and input samples are less powerful than methods that do not. Methods that use windows of different sizes are more powerful than ones that do not. For statistical testing of candidate peaks, methods that use a Poisson test to rank their candidate peaks are more powerful than those that use a Binomial test.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide and a significant source of disability, yet its genetic and environmental risk factors are poorly understood. Its relationship with psychiatric illness, and major depressive disorder (MDD) in particular, is of particular importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors and shared and unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS). We then sought to replicate any significant findings in the UK Biobank study. 

Methods
Using family-based mixed-model analyses, we examined the contribution of genetics and environment to chronic pain using spouse, sibling and household groups as measures of shared environment. We then examined the correlation between chronic pain and MDD and estimated the contribution of genetic factors and shared environment. Finally, we used data from two independent genome-wide association studies to test whether chronic pain has a polygenic risk architecture and examine whether genomic risk of psychiatric disorder predicted chronic pain and whether genomic risk of chronic pain predicted MDD. 

Results
Chronic pain is a moderately heritable trait (narrow sense heritability = 38.4%) which is more likely to be concordant in spouses and partners (variance explained 18.7%). Chronic pain is positively correlated with depression (rho = 0.13, p = 2.72x10-68) and it shows a tendency to cluster within families for genetic reasons (genetic correlation rho = 0.51, p = 8.24x10-19). Polygenic risk profiles for pain, generated using independent GWAS data, predicted chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum  = 6.18x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum  = 5.68 x 10-2, p < 3x10-4). Genomic risk of MDD is also significantly associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum  = 6.62x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum  = 2.56x10-2, p < 3x10-4).

Conclusions
Genetic factors and chronic pain in a partner or spouse contribute substantially to the risk of chronic pain in the general population. Chronic pain is genetically correlated with MDD, has a polygenic architecture and is predicted by polygenic risk of MDD.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1046.pdf,"[( 23 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2016 , 12), ( 26 Jan 2016 , 3)]"

Here, we employ models that explicitly account for load effects to   investigate how these impact the robustness of a stable gene transcription network to parameter perturbations. By employing a combination of sampling-based methods and analytical tools from control theory, we demonstrate that the presence of  loading  shrinks the region of parameter space where a gene circuit performs the desired function. A number of multi-module synthetic gene circuits are analyzed to demonstrate this point, including an event detector and a molecular signature classifier.

However, disentangling variation in sexual dimorphism for both shape (SShD), size (SSD) and their relationship with one another remains complex. Understanding how genetic variation influences both size and shape together, and how this in turn influences SSD and SShD is challenging. In this study we utilize Drosophila wing size and shape as a model system to investigate how mutations influence size and shape as modulated by sex. Previous work has demonstrated that mutations in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Transforming Growth Factor - β (TGF-β) signaling components can influence both wing size and shape. In this study we re-analyze this data to specifically address how they impact the relationship between size and shape in a sex-specific manner, in turn altering the pattern of sexual dimorphism. While most mutations influence shape overall, only a subset have a genotypic specific effect that influences SShD.

Their compounded effects can explain a range of discrepancies between the reported electrophysiological recordings and significantly alter the current interpretation. To test the hypothesis that the bias may significantly alter our current understanding of the moth's auditory transducer characteristics, papers using the same auditory stimulation method and reporting on either spiking threshold or spiking activity of the moth's A cells were analysed. The consistency of the reported data was assessed. A range of corrections issued from best practices and theoretical background were applied to the data in an attempt to re-interpret the data. We found that it is not possible to apply a posteriori corrections to all data and bias. However the corrected data indicates that the A cell's spiking may be (i) independent of the repetition rate, (ii) maximum when detecting the long and low intensity pulses of the bat in searching mode, and (iii) steadily reduce as the bat closes on the moth. These observations raise the possibility that a fixed action pattern drives the moths's erratic evasive manoeuvres until the final moment.

Reflexes are satisfied with relative higher or lower but if the inlet information is presented by different parameters and the response is calculated according to some equation precision must reach the degree which does not slur over the results of calculation. At recent work the equation for controlling of circulation was suggested where the main inlet parameters are the arterial diastolic and vinous pressures and it becomes pertinent to analyze how organism can perceive these pressures with hydrodynamic accuracy. As far as the velocity pressure component of total pressure can not be detected by wall receptor of the rectilinear section of artery it was noticed that baroreceptors are located at the outer radius of the bend of central arteries and that is justified due to specific distribution of pressure. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a correction of measuring of static pressure with regard for velocity pressure component. Velocity pressure component of venous pressure is comparable with the one of arterial pressure but static components of venous and arterial pressures are incomparable and it is the fact that cannot be ignored when choosing the gauge. The possible method of measuring of pressure is based on observation that pressure-volume vector of the ventricular cycle is similar to a-loop vector of atrial cycle. Ventricular filling vector and x-trough vector show the behavior of viscous material but v-loop inserted into a-loop demonstrates typical viscoelasticity with creep. If viscous deformation of atrium at early relaxation possesses standard duration being stopped by transformation of viscous deformation into viscoelastic deformation the venous pressure can be measured in accordance with the value of viscous deformation. Measuring of pressure by viscous method implemented by atrium has the advantage comparing to measuring by baroreceptor with elastic sensor. Early relaxation of atrium which reveals coefficient of viscosity corresponds to ventricular relaxation and its coefficient of viscosity but the latter is liable to different biochemical shifts. Such shifts influences the atrial coefficient of viscosity either and the values of venous pressure measured by viscous method will be more accurate for calculations because coefficient of viscosity participates in the equation being not estimated in organism.,/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1051.pdf,"[( 23 Jan 2016 , 2)]"

We showed that Bari-Jheh is associated with H3K27me3 enrichment, which is consistent with expression changes in adjacent genes. We further showed that stress affects the histone marks introduced by Bari-Jheh, which correlates with further expression changes. Finally, we found that flies with Bari-Jheh, which are resistant to oxidative stress, are also more tolerant to bacterial infection. We conclude that Bari-Jheh influences gene expression and enables stress response through two different mechanisms, by adding cis-regulatory sequences and by adding histone marks, leading to changes in two ecologically relevant phenotypes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1052.pdf,"[( 23 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2016 , 5), ( 05 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

Its specific contribution to prefrontal executive function, however, remains unclear. A neurocomputational model suggests that the FPC implements a basic process referred to as cognitive branching that maintains a task in a pending state during the execution of another, and enables to revert back to it upon completion of the ongoing one. However, the FPC is engaged in other cognitive functions including prospective memory, relational reasoning, episodic memory retrieval and attentional set-shifting, which are not directly linked to the notion of cognitive branching. Here we used a neurocomputional branching model to simulate the involvement of the FPC in these various cognitive functions. Simulation results indicate that the model accounts for the variety of FPC activations observed in these various experimental paradigms. Thus, the present study provides theoretical evidence suggesting that all these behavioral paradigms implicitly involve branching processes, and supports the idea that cognitive branching is the core function of the human frontopolar cortex.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1054.pdf,"[( 22 Jan 2016 , 3)]"

Individual age-dependent rates of survival and reproduction have a strong impact on population dynamics, and the genetic elements determining survival and reproduction are under different selective forces throughout an organism lifespan. Here we develop a highly versatile numerical model of genome evolution - both asexual and sexual - for a population of virtual individuals with overlapping generations, where the genetic elements affecting survival and reproduction rate at different life stages are free to evolve due to mutation and selection. Our model recapitulates several emerging properties of natural populations, developing longer reproductive lifespan under stable conditions and shorter survival and reproduction in unstable environments. Faster aging results as the consequence of the reduced strength of purifying selection in more unstable populations, which have large portions of the genome that accumulate detrimental mutations. Unlike sexually reproducing populations under constant resources, asexually reproducing populations fail to develop an age-dependent increase in death rates and decrease in reproduction rates, therefore escaping senescence.

Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg2+ concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by coordination of Mg2+ ions to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg2+ and topological constraints arising from chain connectivity prevent complete folding of the ribozyme. A much higher Mg2+ concentration is required for complete folding of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ the ribozyme folds but the active site remains unstable.

As a typical example, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a monoclonal population of transformed B cells expands to dominate the B cell population in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. This expansion of transformed B cells suggests that they might evolve through processes distinct from those of normal B cells. Recent advances in next generation sequencing enable the high-throughput identification and tracking of individual B cell clones through sequencing of the V-D-J junction segments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH). Here we developed a statistical approach to modeling cellular evolution of the immune repertoire.   Adapting the infinitely many alleles model from population genetics, we studied abnormalities occurring in the immune repertoire of patients as substantial deviations from the null model. The Ewens sampling test (EST) distinguished the immune repertoires of CLL patients with imminent relapse from healthy controls and patients in sustained remission. Extensive simulations based on sequencing data showed that EST is sensitive in detecting cancer-related derangements of the IGH repertoire. In addition, we suggest two potentially useful parameters: the rate at which donor's B cell clones enter the circulation and the average time to regenerate a transplanted immune repertoire, both of which help to distinguish relapsing CLL patients from those in sustained remission and provide additional information about the dynamics of immune reconstitution in the latter patients.

However, when one-way conversion is insufficiently counterbalanced by selection, the original cell type will ultimately be lost, often with negative impacts on the population's overall fitness. The critical balance between selection and conversion needed for preservation of unconverted cells and the steady-state ratio between cell types depends on the spatial circumstances under which cells proliferate. We present experimental data on a yeast strain engineered to undergo irreversible conversion: this synthetic system permits cell type-specific fluorescent labeling and exogenous variation of the relative growth and conversion rates.

Our model also explores the among traits correlations arising from diversifying selection and how they depend on relatedness due to limited dispersal. We find that selection favours a positive (negative) correlation between two traits, when the selective effects of one trait on relatedness is positively (negatively) correlated to the indirect fitness effects of the other trait. We study the evolution of traits for which this matters: dispersal that decreases relatedness, and helping that has positive indirect fitness effects. We find that when dispersal cost is low and the benefits of helping accelerate faster than its costs, selection leads to the coexistence of mobile defectors and sessile helpers.

The limited ability to sample and quantify latent infection means that supervised antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption studies are generally required. Here we introduce a set of mathematical
and statistical modeling tools to aid in the design and interpretation of ART-interruption trials. We show how the likely size of the remaining reservoir can be updated in real-time as patients continue off treatment, by combining the output of laboratory assays with insights from models of reservoir dynamics and rebound. We design an optimal schedule for viral load sampling during interruption, whereby the frequency of follow-up can be decreased as patients continue off ART without rebound. While this scheme can minimize costs when the chance of rebound between visits is low, we find that the reservoir will be almost completely reseeded before rebound is detected unless sampling occurs at least every two weeks and the most sensitive viral load assays are used. We use simulated data to predict the clinical trial size needed to estimate treatment effects in the face of highly variable patient outcomes and imperfect reservoir assays. Our findings suggest that large numbers of patients - between 40 and 150 - will be necessary to reliably estimate the reservoir-reducing potential of a new therapy and to compare this across interventions. As an example, we apply these methods to the two ""Boston patients"", recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants who experienced large reductions in latent infection and underwent ART-interruption. We argue that the timing of viral rebound was not particularly surprising given the information available before treatment cessation. Additionally, we show how other clinical data can be used to estimate the relative contribution that remaining HIV+ cells in the recipient versus newly infected cells from the donor made to the residual reservoir that eventually caused rebound.

Insertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, such probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions. 
Results
Here, we theoretically tackle the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model allows general indel rate parameters including length distributions but does not impose any unrealistic restrictions on indels. Using techniques of the perturbation theory in physics, we expand the probability into a series over different numbers of indels. Our derivation of this perturbation expansion elegantly bridges the gap between Gillespie′s (1977) intuitive derivation of his own stochastic simulation method, which is now widely used in evolutionary simulators, and Feller′s (1940) mathematically rigorous theorems that underpin Gillespie′s method. We find a sufficient and nearly necessary set of conditions under which the probability can be expressed as the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment. The indel models satisfying these conditions include those with some kind of rate variation across regions, as well as space-homogeneous models.  We also prove that, though with a caveat, pairwise probabilities calculated by the method of Miklós et al. (2004) are equivalent to those calculated by our ab initio formulation, at least under a space-homogenous model.
Conclusions
Our ab initio perturbative formulation provides a firm theoretical ground that other indel models can rest on.

We now show that transposons are the major driving force for adaptive genome evolution in the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Highly variable genomic regions evolved by frequent segmental duplications mediated by erroneous homologous recombination, often utilizing transposons, leading to genetic material that is free to diverge.

Here, we test two hypotheses about the genetic architecture of WUE for foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana Grev. & Balf.) using a novel mixture of double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing, species distribution modeling, and quantitative genetics. First, we test the hypothesis that water availability is an important determinant of the geographical range of foxtail pine. Second, we test the hypothesis that variation in δ13C and δ15N is genetically based, differentiated between regional populations, and has genetic architectures that include loci of large effect. We show that precipitation-related variables structured the geographical range of foxtail pine, climate-based niches differed between regional populations, and δ13C and δ15N were heritable with moderate signals of differentiation between regional populations. A set of large-effect QTLs (n = 11 for δ13C; n = 10 for δ15N) underlying δ13C and δ15N variation, with little to no evidence of pleiotropy, was discovered using multiple-marker, half-sibling regression models.

We find that the interplay between these two loci can produce a 'genomic storage effect' that promotes balanced polymorphism over a large range of parameters, in the absence of all other conditions known to maintain genetic variation.  The genomic storage effect arises as recombination allows alleles at the two loci to escape more harmful genetic backgrounds and associate in haplotypes that persist until environmental conditions change.

In Bayesian node dating, phylogenies are commonly time calibrated through the specification of calibration densities on nodes representing clades with known fossil occurrences. Unfortunately, the optimal shape of these calibration densities is usually unknown and they are therefore often chosen arbitrarily, which directly impacts the reliability of the resulting age estimates. As possible solutions to this problem, two non-exclusive alternative approaches have recently been developed, the ""fossilized birth-death"" model and ""total-evidence dating"". While these approaches have been shown to perform well under certain conditions, they require including all (or a random subset) of the fossils of each clade in the analysis, rather than just relying on the oldest fossils of clades. In addition, both approaches assume that fossil records of different clades in the phylogeny are all the product of the same underlying fossil sampling rate, even though this rate has been shown to differ strongly between higher-level taxa. We here develop a flexible new approach to Bayesian node dating that combines advantages of traditional node dating and the fossilized birth-death model. In our new approach, calibration densities are defined on the basis of first fossil occurrences and sampling rate estimates that can be specified separately for all clades. We verify our approach with a large number of simulated datasets, and compare its performance to that of the fossilized birth death model. We find that our approach produces reliable age estimates that are robust to model violation, on par with the fossilized birth-death model. By applying our approach to a large dataset including sequence data from over 1000 species of teleost fishes as well as 147 carefully selected fossil constraints, we recover a timeline of teleost diversification that is incompatible with previously assumed vicariant divergences of freshwater fishes.

To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations must be measured. Until now measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce, due to the extra effort of collecting diffuse data. Here, we present three-dimensional measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin. The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection. To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS), Liquid-Like Motions (LLM), and coarse-grained Normal Modes (NM) models of protein motions. The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and were refined against the diffuse data, while the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data. Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data. In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data. These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that NM-based refinement can generate dynamics-inspired structural models that simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PNAS/PNAS34.pdf,"[( 09 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 02 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 08 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 10 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 01 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 07 Dec 2015 , 9)]"

Resource availability affects individuals' breeding prospects alone and in groups, as well as how reproduction is distributed within groups (""reproductive skew""). Here, we provide correlational evidence in facultatively social thrips that breeding resources are associated with (1) whether solitary or social living is favoured, and (2) the degree of ovarian skew.
 
Dunatothrips aneurae (Thysanoptera, Phlaeothripidae) cooperatively build silk ""domiciles"" on Australian acacias, feeding exclusively from internal phyllode surfaces. Per capita productivity scaled differently with group size depending on domicile volume - females in small domiciles did better alone than in groups, whereas in large domiciles single and group-nesting females did equally well. Ovarian dissections revealed that in small domiciles some females were nonreproductive, indicating ovarian (i.e. reproductive) skew. Skew increased as domicile size decreased and group size increased. Breeders had smaller oocyte volume in smaller domiciles, especially those containing nonreproductives.
 
These findings suggest group formation and reproductive skew in D. aneurae may be influenced by reproductive competition for breeding resources. Nonreproductive females in small domiciles may be reproductively suppressed, subfertile, or waiting to reproduce.

A common way to achieve long-term chronic recording is to attach the probes to microdrives that progressively advance them into the brain and isolate them from mechanical forces. Here we report, however, that such microdrives are not strictly necessary. Indeed, we obtained high-quality recordings in both head-fixed and freely moving mice for several months following the implantation of immobile chronic probes. Probes implanted into the primary visual cortex yielded well-isolated single units whose spike waveform and orientation tuning were highly reproducible over time.

However, most young duplicates are degraded into pseudogenes by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization, especially through evolution of gene expression, while other models focus on sharing of gene dosage. While studies of whole genome duplications tend to support dosage sharing, the primary mechanisms in mammals-where duplications are small-scale and thus disrupt dosage balance-are unclear. Using RNA-seq data from 46 human and 26 mouse tissues we find that subfunctionalization of expression evolves slowly, and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals. A major impediment to subfunctionalization is that tandem duplicates tend to be co-regulated by shared genomic elements, in contrast to the standard assumption of modularity of gene expression. Instead, consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated to match expression of outgroup singleton genes.

Parsimonious models provide explicit formulas to key measurable quantities and offer guiding insights into the signal-specificity tradeoffs under varying structures and kinetics. Models with measured kinetics from two primary cell-cycle ligases (SCF and APC) explain mechanisms of chain initiation, elongation slowdown, chain-length dependence of E3-substrate affinity, and deubiquitinases. We find that substrate discrimination over ubiquitin transfer rates is consistently more efficient than over substrate-E3 ligase binding energy, regardless of circuit structure, parameter value, and dynamics. E3-associated substrate deubiquitination increases the discrimination over the former and in the meantime decreases the latter, further widening their difference. Both discrimination strategies might be simultaneously explored by an E3 system to effectively proofread substrates as we demonstrated by analyzing experimental data from the CD4-Vpu-SCF system. We also identify that sequential deubiquitination circuit may act as a specificity switch, by which a modest change in deubiquitination and/or processivity can greatly increase substrate discrimination without much compromise in degradation signal. This property may be utilized as a gatekeeper mechanism to direct a temporal polyubiquitination and thus degradation order of substrates with small biochemical differences.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1080.pdf,"[( 04 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

Ninety percent of cases are sporadic (sALS) and ten percent are familial (fALS). The molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain elusive and there is a lack of promising biomarkers that define ALS phenotypes and progression. To date, most expression studies have focused on either complex whole tissues that contain cells other than MNs or induced pluripotent derived MNs (iMNs). Furthermore, as human tissue samples have high variability, estimation of differential gene-expression is not a trivial task. Here, we report a battery of orthogonal computational analyses to discover gene-expression defects in laser capture microdissected and enriched MN RNA pools from sALS patient spinal cords in regions destined for but not yet advanced in neurodegenerative stage. We used total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), applied multiple percentile rank (MPR) analysis to analyze MN-specific gene-expression signatures, and used high-throughput qPCR to validate RNA-seq results. Furthermore, we used a systems-level approach that identified molecular networks perturbed in sALS MNs. Weighted gene co-expression correlation network (WGCNA) analysis revealed defects in neurotransmitter biosynthesis and RNA-processing pathways while gene-gene interaction analysis showed abnormalities in networks that pertained to cell-adhesion, immune response and wound healing. We discover gene-expression signatures that distinguish sALS from control MNs and our findings illuminate possible mechanisms of cellular toxicity. Our systematic and comprehensive analysis serves as a framework to reveal expression signatures and disrupted pathways that will be useful for future mechanistic studies and biomarker based therapeutic research.

Inference of population structure is most often done by applying model-based approaches, aided by visualization using distance-based approaches such as multidimensional scaling. While existing distance-based approaches suffer from lack of statistical rigor, model-based approaches entail assumptions of prior conditions such as that the subpopulations are at Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. Here we present a distance-based approach for inference of population structure using genetic data by defining population structure using network theory terminology and methods. A network is constructed from a pairwise genetic-similarity matrix of all sampled individuals. The community partition, a partition of a network to dense subgraphs, is equated with population structure, a partition of the population to genetically related groups. Community detection algorithms are used to partition the network into communities, interpreted as a partition of the population to subpopulations. The statistical significance of the structure can be estimated by using permutation tests to evaluate the significance of the partition's modularity, a network theory measure indicating the quality of community partitions. In order to further characterize population structure, a new measure of the Strength of Association (SA) for an individual to its assigned community is presented. The Strength of Association Distribution (SAD) of the communities is analyzed to provide additional population structure characteristics, such as the relative amount of gene flow experienced by the different subpopulations and identification of hybrid individuals. Human genetic data and simulations are used to demonstrate the applicability of the analyses. The approach presented here provides a novel, computationally efficient, model-free method for inference of population structure which does not entail assumption of prior conditions.

The model indicates that added drug drives the cell to overproduce ribosomes keeping roughly constant the level of ribosomes producing ribosomal proteins, an important quantity for cell growth.

This movement requires mapping pathways of toxicity through an understanding of how in vitro systems respond to chemical perturbation. Uncovering transcription factors responsible for gene expression patterns is essential for defining pathways of toxicity, and ultimately, for determining chemical mode of action, through which a toxicant acts. Traditionally this is achieved via chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and summarized by calculating, which transcription factors are statistically associated with the up- and down-regulated genes. These lists are commonly determined via statistical or fold-change cutoffs, a procedure that is sensitive to statistical power and may not be relevant to determining transcription factor associations. To move away from an arbitrary statistical or fold-change based cutoffs, we have developed in the context of the Mapping the Human Toxome project, a novel enrichment paradigm called Information Dependent Enrichment Analysis (IDEA) to guide identification of the transcription factor network. We used the test case of endocrine disruption of MCF-7 cells activated by 17β estradiol (E2). Using this new approach, we were able to establish a time course for transcriptional and functional responses to E2. ERα and ERβ are associated with short-term transcriptional changes in response to E2. Sustained exposure leads to the recruitment of an additional ensemble of transcription factors and alteration of cell-cycle machinery. TFAP2C and SOX2 were the transcription factors most highly correlated with dose. E2F7, E2F1 and Foxm1, which are involved in cell proliferation, were enriched only at 24h.

A decade ago, the first elements of what turned out to be a popular inference approach of ancestral ranges based on the processes of Dispersal, local Extinction and Cladogenesis (DEC) was proposed. The success of the DEC model lies in its use of a flexible statistical framework known as a Continuous Time Markov Chain and since, several conceptual and computational improvements have been proposed using this as a baseline approach. In the spirit of the original version of DEC, we introduce DEC eXtended (DECX) by accounting for rapid expansion and local extinction as possible anagenetic events on the phylogeny but without increasing model complexity (i.e. in the number of free parameters). Classical vicariance as a cladogenetic event is also incorporated by making use of temporally flexible constraints on the connectivity between any two given areas in accordance with the movement of landmasses and dispersal opportunity over time. DECX is built upon a previous implementation in C/C++ and can analyze phylogenies on the order of several thousand tips in a few minutes. We test our model extensively on Pseudo Observed Datasets and on well-curated and recently published data from various island clades and a worldwide phylogeny of Amphibians (3309 species).

Multidimensional chemical mapping (MCM) methods seek to address this challenge.

Importantly, MCM analyses provide detailed information on structurally heterogeneous RNA states, such as ligand-free riboswitches, that are functionally important but difficult to resolve with other approaches.

High-throughput “deep” sequencing can now measure this diversity in unprecedented detail, particularly since it can be performed at different timepoints during an infection, and this offers a potentially powerful way to infer the evolutionary dynamics of the intra-host viral population. However, population genomic inference from HIV sequence data is challenging because of high rates of mutation and recombination, rapid demographic changes, and ongoing selective pressures. In this paper we develop a new method for inference using HIV deep sequencing data using an approach based on importance sampling of ancestral recombination graphs under a multi-locus coalescent model. The approach further extends recent progress in the approximation of so-called conditional sampling distributions, a quantity of key interest when approximating coalescent likelihoods. The chief novelties of our method are that it is able to infer rates of recombination and mutation, as well as the effective population size, while handling sampling over different timepoints and missing data without extra computational difficulty. We apply our method to a dataset of HIV-1, in which several hundred sequences were obtained from an infected individual at seven timepoints over two years. We find mutation rate and effective population size estimates to be comparable to those produced by the software BEAST. Additionally, our method is able to produce local recombination rate estimates.

Even though the dimension of this space is equal to the ensemble size, neural activity can be effectively localized on smaller subspaces. The dimensionality of the neural space is an important determinant of the computational tasks supported by the neural activity. Here, we investigate the dimensionality of neural ensembles from the sensory cortex of alert rats during periods of ongoing (inter-trial) and stimulus-evoked activity. We find that dimensionality grows linearly with ensemble size, and grows significantly faster during ongoing activity compared to evoked activity. We explain these results using a spiking network model based on a clustered architecture. The model captures the difference in growth rate between ongoing and evoked activity and predicts a characteristic scaling with ensemble size that could be tested in high-density multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, we present a simple theory that predicts the existence of an upper bound on dimensionality. This upper bound is inversely proportional to the amount of pair-wise correlations and, compared to a homogeneous network without clusters, it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical estimation of such bounds depends on the number and duration of trials and is well predicted by the theory. Together, these results provide a framework to analyze neural dimensionality in alert animals, its behavior under stimulus presentation, and its theoretical dependence on ensemble size, number of clusters, and correlations in spiking network models.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience/Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience3.pdf,"[( 27 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 13 Sep 2015 , 2), ( 04 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

We thus consider the complete, genome-wide universe of genetic variability, spread across several

Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/HIC, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/HIC has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover we show that S/HIC is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/HIC still retains impressive discriminatory power.

There are developing technologies to convert DNA molecules to expanded constructs. Such constructs can be sequenced by nanopores in place of the original DNA molecules. We present a novel method for converting genomic DNA to expanded constructs (proxies) with 99.67% accuracy.
Our method reads each base in each DNA fragment and appends an oligonucleotide to the DNA fragment after each base reading. Each appended oligonucleotide represents a specific base type, so that the proxy construct consisting of all the appended oligonucleotides faithfully represents the original DNA sequence. We generated proxies for genomic DNA and confirmed the identities of both the proxies and their corresponding original DNA sequences by performing sequencing using Ion Torrent sequencer. 
Conversion to proxies had only 0.33% raw error rate. Errors were: 93.96% deletions, 5.29% insertions, and 0.74% substitutions. The longest sequenced proxy was 170 bases, corresponding to a 17-base original DNA sequence. The short length of the detected proxies reflected restrictions imposed by Ion Torrent short reads and was not caused by limitations of our method. The consensus sequence built by using proxies alone (average length: 120 bases; corresponding to original sequences with average length 12 bases ) covered 55% of the reference genome with 100% accuracy, and outperformed the Ion Torrent sequencing of the corresponding original DNA fragments in terms of accuracy, coverage and number of aligned sequences.

Methods: In a prospective-pilot study, we applied NGS in combination with a new computational analysis pipeline to detect the presence of pathogenic microbes in brain or spinal cord biopsies from ten patients with neurological problems indicating possible infection but for whom conventional clinical and microbiology studies yielded negative or inconclusive results.
Results: Direct DNA and RNA sequencing of brain tissue biopsies generated 8.3 million to 29.1 million sequence reads per sample, which successfully identified with high confidence the infectious agent in three patients, identified possible pathogens in two more, and helped to understand neuropathological processes in three others, demonstrating the power of large-scale unbiased sequencing as a novel diagnostic tool.

Furthermore, we identify key virulence factor acquisition events that predate the development of FQR, suggesting that the gain of virulence-associated genes followed by the tandem development of antibiotic resistance primed the successful global dissemination of ST131.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/mBio/mBio4.pdf,"[( 11 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 11 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 03 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 14 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 09 Feb 2016 , 6), ( 10 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

To shed light on the potential relationship between reading and face processing in this group (and in general), we investigated reading performance in 10 participants with DP and 20 matched controls. We find that the group of DPs perform strikingly similar to the control group on four sensitive reading tests measuring visual recognition and naming of single letters and words, word length effects, and text reading speed and comprehension. Thus, there is a clear dissociation between impaired face processing and preserved reading in this group, a finding that challenges the recently proposed hypothesis that reading acquisition and face processing abilities are intrinsically linked.

This variability can be partly explained by associational effects i.e. the impact of the presence of neighboring plants on the level of herbivory experienced by a focal plant, but it is still unclear how the spatial scale of plant neighborhood modulates foraging choice of herbivores; an inherently spatial process in itself. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated how spatial scale modifies associational effects on the susceptibility to browsing by herbivores with movement capacities similar to deer. From 2496 articles found in literature databases, we selected 46 studies providing a total of 168 differences of means in damage by herbivores or survival to woody plants (mostly) with and without neighboring plants. Spatial scales were reported as distance between plants or as plot size. We estimated the relationships between the effect sizes and spatial scale, type of associational effects and nature of the experiment using meta-analysis mixed models. The strength of associational effects declined with increasing plot size, regardless of the type of associational effects. Associational defences (i.e. decrease in herbivory for focal plants associated with unpalatable neighbors) had stronger magnitude than associational susceptibilities. The high remaining heterogeneity among studies suggests that untested factors modulate associational effects, such as nutritional quality of focal and neighboring plants, density of herbivores, timing of browsing, etc. Associational effects are already considered in multiple restoration contexts worldwide, but a better understanding of these relationships could improve their use in conservation, restoration and forest exploitation when browsing is a concern.

Shannon is based on a theory we develop for de novo RNA-Seq assembly that reveals differing abundances among transcripts to be the key, rather than the barrier, to effective assembly. The assembly problem is formulated as a sparsest-flow problem on a transcript graph, and the heart of Shannon is a novel iterative flow-decomposition algorithm.

Cattle are the natural host of BLV where it integrates into B-cells and produces a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about ~5% develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, mirroring the disease trajectory of HTLV-1. The 5′LTRs of both the BLV and HTLV-1 proviruses are transcriptionally silent in tumors, however they are not entirely quiescent, with the HLTV-1 antisense transcript HBZ and the BLV microRNAs constitutively expressed in tumors. Here, using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that in addition to microRNAs, the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses two antisense transcripts in all BLV infected samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) has alternate potential polyadenylation sites generating a short transcript of ~600bp (AS1-S) and a less abundant longer transcript of ~2200bp (AS1-L). Alternative splicing also creates a second transcript of ~400bp (AS2) utilizing the first exon of AS1. Production of AS transcripts from the 3′LTR was supported by reporter assays demonstrating that the BLV LTR has substantial and Tax-independent antisense promoter activity. BLV AS transcripts predominantly localize in the nucleus. Examination of protein coding potential showed AS2 to be non-coding, while the AS1-S/L transcripts coding potential is ambiguous, with a small potential open reading frame (ORF) of 264bp present. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs transcribed in the sense direction. Using high throughput sequencing of RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) 5′RACE products, we show that the perfect complementary between the transcripts leads to RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) mediated cleavage of AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using BLV proviruses where the microRNAs were removed or inverted point to additional transcriptional interactions between the two viral RNA species. Knock down of AS1-S/L using locked nucleic acids (LNAs) showed no obvious effect on the cells phenotype. While a detailed elucidation of the BLV antisense transcripts function remains in the future, the constitutive expression in all samples examined, points to a vital role for the transcripts in the life cycle and oncogenic potential of BLV.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Retrovirology/BMC Retrovirology1.pdf,"[( 09 Feb 2016 , 5), ( 10 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 11 Feb 2016 , 2)]"

It is not well established how quickly gene essentiality can change, as few studies have compared empirical measures of essentiality between closely related organisms. Here we present the results of a Tn-seq experiment designed to detect essential protein coding genes in the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri 2a 2457T on a genome-wide scale. Superficial analysis of this data suggested that 451 protein-coding genes in this Shigella strain are critical for robust cellular growth on rich media. Comparison of this set of genes with a gold-standard data set of essential genes in the closely related Escherichia coli K12 BW25113 suggested that an excessive number of genes appeared essential in Shigella but non-essential in E. coli. Importantly, and in converse to this comparison, we found no genes that were essential in E. coli and non-essential in Shigella, suggesting that many genes were artefactually inferred as essential in Shigella. Controlling for such artefacts resulted in a much smaller set of discrepant genes. Among these, we identified three sets of functionally related genes, two of which have previously been implicated as critical for Shigella growth, but which are dispensable for E. coli growth.  The data presented here highlight the small number of protein coding genes for which we have strong evidence that their essentiality status differs between the closely related bacterial taxa E. coli and Shigella. A set of genes involved in acetate utilization provides a canonical example. These results leave open the possibility of developing strain-specific antibiotic treatments targeting such differentially essential genes, but suggest that such opportunities may be rare in closely related bacteria.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Microbiology/BMC Microbiology1.pdf,"[( 07 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 09 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 08 Feb 2016 , 11), ( 10 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

Here we test this prediction using a large dataset of published estimates of genetic correlations and employing a powerful meta-analytical approach. We considered both between-traits and cross-sex genetic correlations.

Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that this allows ADMIXTURE to infer ancestry for 10,920 individuals in a few hours (a 5x speedup). This mode also allows ADMIXTURE to correctly estimate individual ancestry and allele frequencies from a set of related individuals. The second modification allows ADMIXTURE to correctly handle X-chromosome (and other haploid) data from both males and females.

This is a known problem with parsimony using outgroup species. Here, we show that the problem is particularly serious if there is variation in the substitution rate among sites brought about by variation in selective constraint levels. We present a new method for inferring the SFS using one or two outgroups, which attempts to overcome the problem of misassignment. We show that two outgroups are required for accurate estimation of the SFS if there is substantial variation in selective constraints, which is expected to be the case for nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding genes. We apply the method to estimate unfolded SFSs for synonymous and nonsynonymous sites from Phase 2 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project.

Using animal signaling theory, theoretical visual models and behavioral experimentation, we characterize and determine proximate honesty mechanisms of the facial coloration in the Princess of Burundi cichlid, Neolamprologus brichardi, a species with complex social interactions. We show that this facial color pattern evolved stable chromatic conspicuousness for efficient transmission in the aquatic environment, while context-dependent plasticity in luminance of the horizontal black stripe element is used to signal switches in aggressive intent.

Greaver et al. concluded that the Ithala population did not reach carrying capacity, a conclusion we consider unwarranted since they did not conduct any analyses of trends in demographic parameters with population density. Our interpretation implies that the Ithala population did indeed reach carrying capacity. Where relevant, we compared their results for the Ithala population with those for another southern African black rhinoceros population in order to provide a broader basis for evaluating black rhinoceros demography. We detail inconsistent presentation of data in their paper that plagued our efforts to understand their results and also draw attention to possible errors in some analyses. In particular, we argue that the results on birth rates reported by Greaver et al. appear dubious. Greaver et al. have presented important evidence for density dependence in a population of black rhinoceros but we suggest they have underutilized their data in interpreting this density dependence while misanalysing birth data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1108.pdf,"[( 18 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 11 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

This way, bacteria can acquire new traits such as antibiotic resistance or pathogenic toxins. Current bioinformatics approaches focus on the detection of past HGT events by exploring phylogenetic trees or genome composition inconsistencies. However, this normally requires the availability of finished and fully annotated genomes and of sufficiently large deviations that allow detection. Thus, these techniques are not widely applicable. Especially in an outbreak scenario where new HGT mediated pathogens emerge, there is need for fast and precise HGT detection. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can facilitate swift analysis of unknown pathogens but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no approach uses NGS data directly to detect HGTs.
We present Daisy, a novel mapping-based tool for HGT detection directly from NGS data. Daisy determines HGT boundaries with split-read mapping and evaluates candidate regions relying on read pair and coverage information. Daisy can successfully detect HGT regions with base pair resolution in both simulated and real data, and outperforms alternative approaches using a genome assembly of the reads. We see our approach as a powerful complement for a  comprehensive analysis of HGT in the context of NGS data.

To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks.

To address this problem, I developed a systematic quantitative approach for annotating biological networks and examining their functional structure. This method, named Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), detects network regions that are statistically overrepresented for a functional group or a quantitative phenotype of interest, and provides an intuitive visual representation of their relative positioning within the network. By successfully annotating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic interaction network with Gene Ontology terms, SAFE proved to be sensitive to functional signals and robust to noise. In addition, SAFE annotated the network with chemical genomic data and uncovered a new potential mechanism of resistance to the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. Finally, SAFE showed that protein-protein interactions, despite their apparent complexity, also have a high level functional structure.

Instances of adaptive radiation, characterized by the rapid emergence of an array of species as a consequence to their adaptation to distinct ecological niches, are important study systems in evolutionary biology. However, because of the rapid lineage formation in these groups, and the occurrence of hybridization between the participating species, it is often difficult to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of species that underwent an adaptive radiation. In this study, we present a novel approach for species-tree estimation in rapidly diversifying lineages, where introgression is known to occur, and apply it to a multimarker dataset containing up to 16 specimens per species for a set of 45 species of East African cichlid fishes (522 individuals in total), with a main focus on the cichlid species flock of Lake Tanganyika. We first identified, using age distributions of most recent common ancestors in individual gene trees, those lineages in our dataset that show strong signatures of past introgression. This led us to formulate three hypotheses of introgression between different lineages of Tanganyika cichlids: the ancestor of Boulengerochromini (or of Boulengerochromini and Bathybatini) received genomic material from the derived H-lineage; the common ancestor of Cyprichromini and Perissodini experienced, in turn, introgression from Boulengerochromini and/or Bathybatini; and the Lake Tanganyika Haplochromini and closely related riverine lineages received genetic material from Cyphotilapiini. We then applied the multispecies coalescent model to estimate the species tree of Lake Tanganyika cichlids, but excluded the lineages involved in these introgression events, as the multispecies coalescent model does not incorporate introgression. This resulted in a robust species tree, in which the Lamprologini were placed as sister lineage to the H-lineage (including the Eretmodini), and we identify a series of rapid splitting events at the base of the H-lineage. Divergence ages estimated with the multispecies coalescent model were substantially younger than age estimates based on concatenation, and agree with the geological history of the Great Lakes of East Africa. Finally, we formally tested the three hypotheses of introgression using a likelihood framework, and find strong support for introgression between some of the cichlid tribes of Lake Tanganyika.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Systematic Biology/Systematic Biology19.pdf,"[( 13 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 06 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 12 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 11 Feb 2016 , 6)]"

In mice, it has been shown that within-population craniofacial variation has a highly polygenic basis, but there are no data regarding the genetic basis of between-species differences. Here, we address this question using a phenotype-focused approach. Using 3D geometric morphometrics, we phenotyped a panel of mice derived from a natural hybrid zone between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, and quantify the transition of craniofacial shape along the hybridization gradient. We find a continuous shape transition along the hybridization gradient, and unaltered developmental stability associated with hybridization. This suggests that the morphospace between the two subspecies is continuous despite reproductive isolation and strong barriers to gene flow.

The side-chain orientation of R82 is determined primarily by the protonation states of the residues in the EC. The side-chain reorientation of R82 modulates the hydrogen-bond network and consequently possible pathways of proton transfer. Quantum mechanical intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations of proton-transfer in the methyl guanidinium-hydronium-hydroxide model system show that proton transfer via a guanidinium group requires an initial geometry permitting proton donation and acceptance by the same amine. In all the models, R82 can form proton wires with both the CC and the EC connected by the same amine.

We also found that triclosan exposure is associated with topological alterations to microbial interaction networks and results in an overall increase in the number of negative interactions per microbe in these networks.

Viable triploids are often produced asymmetrically, with greater success observed for maternal-excess crosses where the mother has a higher ploidy than the father. Here we investigate the evolutionary origins of Mimulus peregrinus, an allopolyploid recently derived from the triploid M. x robertsii, to determine whether reproductive asymmetry has shaped the formation of this new species.
Methods: We used reciprocal crosses between the diploid (M. guttatus) and tetraploid (M. luteus) progenitors to determine the viability of triploid hybrids resulting from paternal- versus maternal-excess crosses. To investigate whether experimental results predict patterns seen in the field, we performed parentage analyses comparing natural populations of M. peregrinus to its diploid, tetraploid, and triploid progenitors. Organellar sequences obtained from pre-existing genomic data, supplemented with additional genotyping was used to establish the maternal ancestry of multiple M. peregrinus and M. x robertsii populations.
Key results: We find strong evidence for asymmetric origins of M. peregrinus, but opposite to the common pattern, with paternal-excess crosses significantly more successful than maternal-excess crosses.

Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Masson′s Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study.

The goal is to balance the accumulated number of sites per CPU, and, at the same time, to minimize the maximum number of unique partitions per CPU. The approximation algorithm assumes that likelihood calculations on individual alignment sites have identical runtimes and that likelihood calculation times on distinct sites are entirely independent from each other. However, a recently introduced optimization of the phylogenetic likelihood function, the so-called site repeats technique, violates both aforementioned assumptions. To this end, we modify our data distribution algorithm and explore 72 distinct heuristic strategies that take into account the additional restrictions induced by site repeats, to yield a 'good' parallel load balance.

The 'central dogma' of small molecule docking is that compounds that dock correctly into the receptor are more likely to display biological activity than those that do not dock. This 'dogma', however, possesses multiple twists and turns that may not be obvious to novice dockers. The first premise is that the compounds must dock; this implies: (i) availability of data, (ii) realistic representation of the chemical entities in a form that can be understood by the computer and the software, and, (iii) exhaustive sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space. The second premise is that, after the sampling, all docking solutions must be ranked correctly with a score representing the physico-chemical foundations of binding. The third premise is that 'correctness' must be defined unambiguously, usually by comparison with 'static' experimental data (or lack thereof). Each of these premises involves some degree of simplification of reality, and overall loss in the accuracy of the docking predictions.

In this chapter we will revise our latest experiences in receptor-based docking when dealing with all three above-mentioned issues. First, we will explain the theoretical foundation of ICM docking, along with a brief explanation on how we measure performance. Second, we will contextualize ICM by showing its performance in single and multiple receptor conformation schemes with the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) and the Pocketome.

We present the algorithm MetaPalette which uses long k-mer sizes (k=30, 50) to fit a k-mer ""palette"" of a given sample to the k-mer palette of reference organisms. By modeling the k-mer palettes of unknown organisms, the method also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel organisms present in the sample. The method returns a traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference sequences and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins and a metagenomic soil sample.

Maintenance and improvement of growth performance in a changing environment is a main challenge for forest tree breeders. In this context, genetic variation as a factor underlying phenotypic variation, but also as the basis for future adaptation, is of particular interest. The aims of this study were to analyse (i) genetic diversity of selected Douglas-fir provenances, (ii) variation in height growth among provenances, and (iii) to assess the link between genetic and phenotypic variation height growth. Genotyping was done on microsatellite loci. Effects of provenance, genotype, and site on height growth were assessed by fitting mixed linear models. The most significant genetic differentiation was observed between provenances of the coastal variety, versus a provenance of the interior variety originating from British Columbia. Although genetic differentiation among provenances of the coastal variety was lower, genetic structures within this variety were identified. Moreover, genetic diversity showed a latitudinal gradient with the southernmost provenances being more diverse, probably reflecting the species' evolutionary history. The modelling approach revealed that height growth differed significantly by provenance, site, and the interaction between site and provenance, demonstrating that height growth is under strong genetic control. Additionally, this analysis showed that genetic variation captured by the genotyped microsatellite loci was significantly related to variation in height growth, providing statistical evidence for a genetic component in the observed phenotypic variation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/European Journal of Forest Research/European Journal of Forest Research1.pdf,"[( 26 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 18 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 17 Feb 2016 , 5)]"

Despite caution that the reliability of HSIs must be validated using independent, quantitative data, most HSIs intended to inform terrestrial and marine species management remain unvalidated. Furthermore, of the eight HSI models developed for eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration and fishery production, none has been validated. Consequently, we developed, calibrated, and validated an HSI for the eastern oyster to identify optimal habitat for restoration in a tributary of Chesapeake Bay, the Great Wicomico River (GWR). The GWR harbors an unparalleled, restored oyster population, and therefore serves as an excellent model system for assessing the validity of the HSI. The HSI was derived from GIS layers of bottom type, salinity, and water depth (surrogate for dissolved oxygen), and was tested using live adult oyster density data from a survey of high vertical relief reefs (HRR) and low vertical relief reefs (LRR) in the sanctuary network. Live adult oyster density was a statistically significant sigmoid function of the HSI, which validates the HSI as a robust predictor of suitable oyster reef habitat for rehabilitation or restoration. In addition, HRR had on average 103-116 more adults m-2 than LRR at a given level of the HSI. For HRR, HSI values ≥0.3 exceeded the accepted restoration target of 50 live adult oysters m-2. For LRR, the HSI was generally able to predict live adult oyster densities that meet or exceed the target at HSI values ≥0.3. The HSI indicated that there remain large areas of suitable habitat for restoration in the GWR.

The cooperative nature of public good production may lead to minimum viable population sizes, below which populations collapse.  In addition, cooperator public goods producing cells face evolutionary competition from non-producing mutants, or freeloaders. Thus, public goods cooperators have to be stable not only to the invasion of freeloaders, but also to ecological perturbations that may push their numbers too small to be sustainable. Through a combination of experiments with microbial populations and mathematical analysis of the Ecological Public Goods Game, we show that game parameters and experimental conditions that improve the evolutionary stability of cooperators also lead to a low ecological stability of the cooperator population. Complex regulatory strategies mimicking those used by microbes in nature may allow cooperators to beat this eco-evolutionary stability tradeoff and become resistant to freeloaders while at the same time maximizing their ecological stability.

To study such a transition we focused on H3K9 methylation, a heterochromatin mark found in metazoans and in the fission yeast S. pombe, but which has been lost in the lineage leading to the model budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that this mark is present in the relatively understudied yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, a Hemiascomycete that diverged from S. cerevisiae prior to the whole-genome duplication event that played a key role in the evolution of a primarily fermentative lifestyle. We mapped genome-wide patterns of H3K9 methylation as well as several conserved modifications.

Interestingly, we show H3K9 methylation in K. lactis primarily occurs over highly-transcribed regions, including both Pol2 and Pol3 transcription units. We identified the H3K9 methylase as the ortholog of Set6, whose function in S. cerevisiae is obscure.

Associations and interactions between neuroticism and general intelligence (g) on MDD and psychological distress were examined in two population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, N=19,200) and UK Biobank (N=90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in GS:SFHS. 

Neuroticism was associated with MDD and psychological distress in both samples. A significant interaction between neuroticism and g in predicting MDD status was found in UK Biobank (OR = 0.96, p < .01), suggesting that higher g ameliorated the adverse effects of neuroticism on the likelihood of having MDD. This interaction was not found in GS:SFHS. In both samples, higher neuroticism and lower intelligence were associated with increased psychological distress. A significant interaction was also found in both cohorts (GS:SFHS: β = -0.05, p < .01; UK Biobank: β = -0.02, p < .01), such that intelligence protected against the deleterious effect of neuroticism on psychological distress.

Recent studies have reported that CH4 concentrations in cave ecosystems are depleted and that these subterranean environments may act as a daily sinks for atmospheric CH4. It has been hypothesized that this CH4 depletion may be caused by radiolysis, an abiotic process whereby CH4 is oxidized via interactions with ionizing radiation derived from radon decay. Alternatively, the depletion of CH4 concentrations could be due to biological processes, specifically oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. We theoretically explored the radiolysis hypothesis and conclude that it is a kinetically constrained process that is unlikely to lead to the rapid loss of CH4 in subterranean environments. We present experimental results to support this claim. We tested the microbial oxidation hypothesis in a set of mesocosm experiments that were conducted in Vietnamese caves. Our results reveal that methanotrophic bacteria associated with cave rocks consume CH4 at a rate of 1.33 - 2.70 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. These CH4 oxidation rates equal or exceed what has been reported in other habitats, including agricultural systems, grasslands, deciduous forests, and Arctic tundra. As such, microbial methanotrophy has the potential to significantly oxidize CH4 in caves, but also smaller-size open subterranean spaces, such as cracks, fissures, and other pores that are connected to and rapidly exchange with the atmosphere. Future studies are needed to understand how subterranean CH4 oxidation scales up to affect regional and global CH4 cycling.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Geobiology/Geobiology1.pdf,"[( 20 Dec 2015 , 3), ( 18 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 21 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 17 Feb 2016 , 2)]"

Therefore, the structure of an organ GRN restricts the morphological and functional variations that the organ can experience -its potential morphospace. Therefore, two important questions arise when studying any GRN: what is the predicted available morphospace and what are the regulatory linkages that contribute the most to control morphological variation within this space. Here, we explore these questions by analyzing a small ""3-node"" GRN model that captures the Hh-driven regulatory interactions controlling a simple visual structure: the ocellar region of Drosophila. Analysis of the model predicts that random variation of model parameters results in a specific non-random distribution of morphological variants. Study of a limited sample of Drosophilids and other dipterans finds a correspondence between the predicted phenotypic range and that found in nature.

But what happens after the range's leading edge has passed and the games are over? Although empirical studies indicate that dispersal propensity attenuates following range expansion, hypotheses about the mechanisms driving this attenuation have not been clearly articulated or tested. Here we use a simple model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of two phenotypes, one fast and the other slow, to propose that dispersal attenuation beyond pre-expansion levels is only possible in the presence of trade-offs between dispersal and life-history traits. The Olympic Village effect ensures that fast dispersers pre-empt locations far from the range's previous limits. When trade-offs are absent, this pre-emptive spatial advantage has a lasting impact, with highly dispersive individuals attaining equilibrium frequencies that are strictly higher than their introduction frequencies. When trade-offs are present, dispersal propensity decays rapidly at all locations. Our model's results about the post-colonization trajectory of dispersal evolution are clear and, in principle, should be observable in field studies.

The standard latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), in which species richness decreases from equator to pole, is a pervasive pattern observed in most groups of organisms. Despite its commonness, an increasing number of non-conforming lineages have been identified, presenting a challenge for general explanations of the standard LDG. Although problematic, documenting and studying these contrarian groups can help us to better understand LDGs generally. To that end we identify the ant tribe Stenammini, a diverse lineage with over 400 species, as a contrarian clade, and we attempt to explain the group's atypical diversity pattern using a historical approach. We evaluate the following alternative hypotheses: time-for-speciation/center-of-origin (TFS/COO), niche conservatism, and differences in diversification rate.

Location. Global.

Methods. We examine the shape of the LDG in Stenammini by plotting latitudinal midpoints for all extant species. We then infer a robust phylogeny using a phylogenomic approach that employs ultraconserved element loci and we use the phylogeny to estimate divergence dates, biogeographic history, and ancestral habitats. We also test for diversification rate heterogeneity across the tree and among lineages within the tribe.

Results. Stenammini has a skewed inverse latitudinal diversity gradient with an extratropical richness peak in the northern temperate zone. Our phylogenomic approach resulted in a robust phylogeny revealing five major clades and several instances of non-monophyly among genera (Goniomma, Aphaenogaster). The tribe and most major lineages originated in the temperate zone and inhabited temperate niches. Crown Stenammini dates to 52 Ma (Eocene Climatic Optimum) and most major lineages appeared soon after during a period of global cooling. Despite its temperate origin, the group invaded the tropics at least six times, but failed to diversify greatly there. Across the tree diversification increased from 17.2-1.9 Ma following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and among lineages there was a rate increase in Holarctic Aphaenogaster + Messor just prior to 17.2 Ma.

Main Conclusions. Our results suggest that time, niche conservatism, and increased diversification have all contributed to the inverse latitudinal gradient in Stenammini. Among these processes, niche conservatism may be less important given that the tribe has dispersed to the tropics multiple times.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1126.pdf,"[( 18 Feb 2016 , 7), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

Clinical similarities and genetic overlap between the three disorders have been reported; however, the causes and the downstream effects of this overlap remain elusive. By analyzing transcriptomic RNA-Sequencing data generated from post-mortem cortical brain tissues from AUT, SCZ, BPD and control subjects, we have begun to characterize the extent of gene expression overlap between these disorders. We report that the AUT and SCZ transcriptomes are significantly correlated (p<0.001), while the other two cross disorder comparisons (AUT-BPD, SCZ-BPD) are not. Among AUT and SCZ, we find that the genes differentially expressed across disorders are involved in neurotransmission and synapse regulation. Despite lack of global transcriptomic overlap across all three disorders, we highlight two genes, IQSEC3 and COPS7A, which are significantly down-regulated compared to controls across all three disorders, suggesting either shared etiology or compensatory changes across these neuropsychiatric conditions. Finally, we tested for enrichment of genes differentially expressed across disorders in genetic association signals in AUT, SCZ or BPD, reporting lack of signal in any of the previously published GWAS. Together, these studies highlight the importance of examining gene expression from the primary tissue involved in neuropsychiatric conditions, cortical brain.

This problem was shown to be NP-complete even in the ""simplest"" case of three genomes, thus calling for heuristic rather than exact algorithmic solutions. At the same time, a larger number of input genomes may actually simplify the problem in practice as it was earlier illustrated with MGRA, a state-of-the-art software tool for reconstruction of ancestral genomes of multiple genomes. 

One of the key obstacles for MGRA and other similar tools is presence of breakpoint reuses when the same breakpoint region is broken by several different genome rearrangements in the course of evolution. Furthermore, such tools are often limited to genomes composed of the same genes with each gene present in a single copy in every genome. This limitation makes these tools inapplicable for many biological datasets and degrades the resolution of ancestral reconstructions in diverse datasets. 

We address these deficiencies by extending the MGRA algorithm to genomes with unequal gene contents. The developed next-generation tool MGRA2 can handle gene gain/loss events and shares the ability of MGRA to reconstruct ancestral genomes uniquely in the case of limited breakpoint reuse. 
Furthermore, MGRA2 employs a number of novel heuristics to cope with higher breakpoint reuse and process datasets inaccessible for MGRA. In practical experiments, MGRA2 shows superior performance for simulated and real genomes as compared to other ancestral genomes reconstruction tools.
The MGRA2 tool is distributed as an open-source software and can be downloaded from GitHub repository http://github.com/ablab/mgra/.

Data consistency was evaluated using annual and monthly expansion factors (EFs) as cohort incidence divided by incidence in each surveillance system, to assess their reliability for estimating disease burden (annual) and monitoring disease trends (monthly). Annually, passive surveillance data more closely estimated cohort incidence (average annual EF=5) than did data from sentinel surveillance (average annual EF=19). Monthly passive surveillance data generally were more consistent (ratio of sentinel/passive EF standard deviations=2.2) but overestimated incidence in 26% (11/43) of months, most often during the second half of the annual high season as dengue incidence typically wanes from its annual peak. Increases in sentinel surveillance incidence were correlated temporally (correlation coefficient = 0.86) with increases in the cohort, while passive surveillance data were significantly correlated at both zero-lag and a one-month lag (0.63 and 0.44, respectively). Together these results suggest that, rather than relying on a single data stream, a clearer picture of changes in infectious disease incidence might be achieved by combining the timeliness of sentinel surveillance with the representativeness of passive surveillance.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1128.pdf,"[( 05 Nov 2017 , 3), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 6)]"

Thus, disrupting genes in polyploid cell lines, or using inefficient sgRNAs, can require extensive downstream screening to identify homozygous clones. We have found that linear, non-homologous oligonucleotide DNA greatly stimulates Cas9-mediated gene disruption in the absence of homology-directed repair. This stimulation greatly increases the frequency of clones with homozygous gene disruptions, even in polyploid cell lines, and rescues otherwise ineffective sgRNAs. The mechanism of enhanced gene disruption differs between human cell lines, stimulating deletion of genomic sequence and/or insertion of non-homologous oligonucleotide DNA at the edited locus in a cell line specific manner.

A strong positive correlation was found between local relative abundance and occupancy of populations. Notably, the occupancy-frequency distributions (the number of populations occupying different number of sites) were significantly bimodal with a satellite mode of mostly rare endemic populations and a core mode of abundant cosmopolitan populations (e.g. Synechococcus, SAR11 and SAR86 clade members). Observed temporal changes in population distributions supported theoretical predictions that stochastic variation in local extinction and colonization rates accounted for observed bimodality. Moreover, bimodality was found for bacterioplankton across the entire Baltic Sea, and was also frequent in globally distributed datasets where average Bray-Curtis distances were significantly different between bimodal and non-bimodal datasets. Still, datasets spanning waters with distinct physicochemical characteristics or environmental gradients, e.g. brackish and marine or surface to deep waters, typically lacked significant bimodal patterns. When such datasets were divided into subsets with coherent environmental conditions, bimodal patterns emerged, highlighting the importance of positive feedbacks between local abundance and occupancy within specific biomes.

This hypothesis predicts that, on average, rare species should experience stronger negative frequency dependence than common species. However, it is unknown if ecological communities generally show this theoretical pattern, or if rarity is primarily determined by other processes that overwhelm the effects of strong negative frequency dependence. We discuss the implications of this mechanism for natural communities, and develop a method to test for a non-random relationship between negative frequency dependence and relative abundance, using species abundance data from 90 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. To account for biases introduced by measurement error, we compared the observed correlation between species relative abundance and the strength of frequency dependence against expectations from a randomization procedure. In approximately half of the analyzed communities, rare species showed disproportionately strong negative frequency dependence compared to common species.

Among those functions are stem cell differentiation, cell spreading, and cell signaling [1]. In the context of differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), substrates with E in the ranges of <4 kPa, 8-17 kPa, and >25 kPa, have been classified as soft (adipogenic) [2,3], medium rigidity (myogenic)1, and hard (osteogenic) [1], respectively. In most studies, the soft substrates are hydrogels, and variations in their elastic moduli are usually accompanied by variations in the dry mass and porosity. The paradigm of the effect of substrate rigidity on the cellular functions has been challenged by Trappmann et al. [4], who claimed that cell spreading and differentiation on hydrogel substrates depend not on the elastic moduli of the substrates, but rather on their porosity, which affects the density of adhesion points between the substrate surface and the extracellular matrix (ECM) coating on it. This claim has been rebutted by Wen at al. [3], who have used hydrogel substrates with different porosities but identical elastic moduli to show that it is the elastic modulus rather than the porosity that is key to the effect of the substrate on cell spreading and differentiation. Both publications agree, however, that there is no appreciable effect of the substrate rigidity on either cell spreading or differentiation, if the substrate is made of a silicone gel rather than a hydrogel. This conclusion appears to contradict the findings of several other groups, who reported that when cells are plated on an array of flexible silicone microposts, their spreading and differentiation depend on the rigidity of the substrate [5], and that when cell are plated on silicone gels, their differentiation depends on the gel rigidity [6].

However, the ecological processes determining local cichlid diversity have so far been understudied, even though knowledge on these might be crucial for understanding larger scale biodiversity patterns. 
Using trait, environmental and abundance data of cichlid fishes along 36 transects, we have studied how differences in local environmental conditions influence cichlid community assembly in the littoral of Lake Tanganyika, Zambia. We investigated changes in average trait values and in trait-based community assembly processes along three key environmental gradients. 
Species diversity and local abundance decreased with increasing sand cover and diet-associated traits changed with depth. Analyses on within-community trait diversity patterns indicated that cichlid community assembly was mainly driven by stochastic processes, to a smaller extent by processes that limit the similarity among co-existing species and least by filtering processes that limit the range of species traits occurring in an environment. Despite the low impact of habitat filtering processes, we find community dissimilarity to increase with increasing environmental difference.  
Our results suggest that local environmental conditions determine cichlid abundance, while the predominance of stochastic community assembly across all environments explains why the communities with the highest abundances contain most species.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1133.pdf,"[( 20 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 13 Feb 2016 , 10), ( 18 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 24 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 3)]"

DISCERN takes two expression datasets as input:  an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from matching normal tissues.  DISCERN estimates the extent to which each gene is perturbed - having distinct regulator connectivity in the inferred gene-regulatory dependencies between the disease and normal conditions.  This approach has distinct advantages over existing methods.  First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than pairwise correlation.  Second, DISCERN uses a new likelihood-based scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the specific edges inferred in a particular network.  DISCERN identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than existing methods to identify perturbed genes between distinct states.  In expression datasets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and lung cancer, genes with high DISCERN scores in each cancer are enriched for known tumor drivers, genes associated with the biological processes known to be important in the disease, and genes associated with patient prognosis, in the respective cancer.

The prevalence of chromosome segregation errors in cancer - first noted more than 100 years ago - has led to the widespread belief that aneuploidy plays a crucial role in tumor development.  Here, we set out to test this hypothesis.  We transduced congenic euploid and trisomic fibroblasts with 14 different oncogenes or oncogene combinations, thereby creating genetically-matched cancer cell lines that differ only in karyotype.  Surprisingly, nearly all aneuploid cell lines divided slowly in vitro, formed few colonies in soft agar, and grew poorly as xenografts, relative to matched euploid lines.  Similar results were obtained when comparing a near-diploid human colorectal cancer cell line with derivatives of that line that harbored extra chromosomes.  Only a few aneuploid lines grew at close to wild-type levels, and no aneuploid line exhibited greater tumorigenic capabilities than its euploid counterpart.  These results demonstrate that rather than promoting tumorigenesis, aneuploidy, particularly single chromosome gains, can very often function as a tumor suppressor.  Moreover, our results suggest one potential way that cancers can overcome the tumor suppressive effects of aneuploidy: rapidly-growing aneuploid cell lines that had evolved in vitro or in vivo demonstrated recurrent karyotype changes that were absent from their euploid counterparts.  Thus, the genome-destabilizing effects of single-chromosome aneuploidy may facilitate the development of balanced, high-complexity karyotypes that are frequently found in advanced malignancies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1138.pdf,"[( 13 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 11 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 21 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 26 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 09 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 22 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 20 Feb 2016 , 6)]"

Hsp70 chaperones use a chaperoning mechanism different from Hsp90 and GroEL, and it is not known whether they can also buffer mutations. Here, we show that they can. To this end, we performed a mutation accumulation experiment in Escherichia coli, followed by whole-genome resequencing. Our sequence data shows that overexpression of the Hsp70 chaperone DnaK increases the tolerance of its clients for nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and nucleotide insertions and deletions. We also show that this elevated mutational buffering on short evolutionary time scales translates into differences in evolutionary rates on intermediate and long evolutionary time scales. To this end, we compared the evolutionary rates of DnaK clients and nonclients using the genomes of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and 83 other gamma-proteobacterial species. We find that clients that interact strongly with DnaK evolve faster than weakly interacting clients.

We present Kronos, a software platform for automating the development and execution of reproducible, auditable and distributable bioinformatics workflows. Kronos obviates the need for explicit coding of workflows by compiling a text configuration file into executable Python applications. The framework of each workflow includes a run manager to execute the encoded workflows locally (or on a cluster or cloud), parallelize tasks, and log all runtime events. Resulting workflows are highly modular and configurable by construction, facilitating flexible and extensible meta-applications which can be modified easily through configuration file editing. The workflows are fully encoded for ease of distribution and can be instantiated on external systems, promoting and facilitating reproducible research and comparative analyses. We introduce a framework for building Kronos components which function as shareable, modular nodes in Kronos workflows.
The Kronos platform provides a standard framework for developers to implement custom tools, reuse existing tools, and contribute to the community at large. Kronos is shipped with both Docker and Amazon AWS machine images. It is free, open source and available through PyPI (Python Package Index) and https://github.com/jtaghiyar/kronos.

We propose that the fatal effect of inactivating an essential gene can be attributed to either the loss of indispensable core cellular function (type I), or the gain of fatal side effects after losing dispensable periphery function (type II).  In principle, inactivation of the type I essential genes can be rescued only by re-gain of the core functions, whereas inactivation of the type II essential genes could be rescued by a further loss of function of another gene to eliminate the otherwise fatal side effects.  Because such loss-of-function rescuing mutations may occur spontaneously, type II essential genes may become non-essential in a few individuals of a large population.  We tested this idea in the yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae.  Large-scale whole genome sequencing of such essentiality-reversing mutants reveals 14 cases where inactivation of an essential gene is rescued by loss-of-function mutations on another gene.  In particular, the essential gene encoding the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is shown to be type II, suggesting a loss-of-function therapeutic strategy for the human disorder ADSL deficiency.

A 98-genes GES identified 89% and 100% of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in Gleason 7 and Gleason 6 patients, respectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83% and 100% of all deaths events were captured in Gleason 7 and Gleason 6 patients, respectively. Remarkably, the 98-genes GES appears to perform successfully in patients stratification with as little as 2% of cancer cells in a specimen, strongly indicating that it captures a malignant field effect in human prostates harboring cancer cells of different degrees of aggressiveness.

Many phenotypes have imperfect heritability, so that a measurement of the phenotype for an individual can be thought of as a single realisation from the phenotype distribution of that individual. If all individuals in a phylogeny had the same phenotype distribution, measured phenotypes would be randomly distributed on the tree leaves. This is however often not the case, implying that the phenotype distribution evolves over time. Here we propose a new model based on this principle of evolving phenotype distribution on the branches of a phylogeny, which is different from ancestral state reconstruction where the phenotype itself is assumed to evolve. We develop an efficient Bayesian inference method to estimate the parameters of our model and to test the evidence for changes in the phenotype distribution. We use multiple simulated datasets to show that our algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity properties. Since our method identifies branches on the tree on which the phenotype distribution has changed, it is able to break down a tree into components for which this distribution is unique and constant.

While increased variability in the context of single cell gene expression is well recognized, our computational simulations indicated that in a multicellular organism intrinsic single cell level noise should cancel out and thus the impact of gene copy reduction on organismal level expression variability must be due to something else. To systematically examine the impact of gene dose reduction on expression variability in a multi-cellular organism, we performed experimental gene expression measurements in Drosophila DrosDel autosomal deficiency lines.  Genome-wide analysis revealed that autosomal one dose genes have higher gene expression variability relative to two dose genes. In flies, gene dose reduction is often accompanied by dosage compensation at the gene expression level. Surprisingly, expression noise was increased by compensation. This increased compensation-dependent variability was found to be a property of one dose autosomal genes but not X-liked genes in males despite the fact that they too are dosage compensated, suggesting that sex chromosome dosage compensation also results in noise reduction. Previous studies attributed autosomal dosage compensation to feedback loops in interaction networks. Our results suggest that these feedback loops are not optimized to deliver consistent responses to gene deletion events and thus gene deletions can lead to heterogeneous responses even in the context of an identical genetic background. Additionally, we show that expression variation associated with reduced dose of transcription factors propagate through the gene interaction network, impacting a large number of downstream genes.

However, analysis of 4C-Seq data is complicated by the many biases inherent to the technique. An important consideration when dealing with 4C-Seq data is the differences in resolution of signal across the genome that result from differences in 3D distance separation from the bait.  This leads to the highest signal in the region immediately surrounding the bait and increasingly lower signals in far-cis and trans. Another important aspect of 4C-Seq is the resolution, which is greatly influenced by the choice of restriction enzyme and the frequency at which it can cut the genome. Thus, it is important that a 4C-Seq analysis method is flexible enough to analyze data generated using different enzymes and to identify interactions across the entire genome. Current methods for 4C-Seq analysis only identify interactions in regions near the bait or in regions located in far-cis and trans, but no method comprehensively analyzes 4C signals of different length scales. In addition, some methods also fail in experiments where chromatin fragments are generated using frequent cutter restriction enzymes. Here, we describe 4C-ker, a Hidden-Markov Model based analysis that identifies regions throughout the genome that interact with the 4C bait locus. In addition we incorporate methods for the identification of differential interactions in multiple 4C-seq datasets collected from different genotypes or experimental conditions. Adaptive window sizes are used to correct for differences in signal coverage in near-bait regions, far-cis and trans chromosomes.

However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable model of the phenomenon is that needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5, and L6). The conditional transfer entropies (cTE) from the phases to the amplitudes of the generated oscillations are estimated by means of the conditional mutual information. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g, theta-gamma or alpha-gamma) we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between them and, on average, did not depend upon the presence or absence of a direct (anatomical) connection. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more efficient when transmitting information. Since more than 60 % of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLoS Computational Biology/PLoS Computational Biology1.pdf,"[( 28 Jul 2015 , 4), ( 23 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations. 
Procedure: This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine.
Results: There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), 8 (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4).
Conclusions: The MSKCC PMTB enabled a clinically relevant interpretation of genomic profiling. Effective use of clinical genomics is anticipated to require new and improved tools to ascribe pathogenic significance and therapeutic actionability.

Our analysis reveals a clear signal of purifying selection to reduce the large number of weak binding sites genome-wide. This evolutionary process, which we call global selection, has a detectable hallmark in that similar words experience similar evolutionary pressure, a consequence of the biophysics of protein-DNA binding.

The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis exits the host cell by two distinct exit strategies, lysis and extrusion. Despite being equally active pathways, lysis and extrusion differ greatly in their mechanisms. The defining characteristics of extrusions, and advantages gained by Chlamydia within this unique double-membrane structure are not well understood. Here, we present data that defines extrusions as being largely devoid of host organelles, comprised mostly of Chlamydia elementary bodies, and containing phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the extrusion membrane. Towards defining a functional role for extrusions in Chlamydia pathogenesis, we demonstrate that extrusions confer significant infectious advantages for Chlamydia by serving as transient, intracellular-like niches for extracellular Chlamydia, as compared to Chlamydia that would otherwise exit by lysing the host cell. In addition to enhanced survival outside of the host cell, we report the key discovery that chlamydial extrusions can be engulfed by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, after which they provide a protective microenvironment for Chlamydia. Extrusion-derived Chlamydia were able to stave off macrophage based killing beyond 8 h, and culminated in the release of infectious EB from the macrophage. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which a major outcome of Chlamydia exiting epithelial cells inside extrusions is to hijack macrophages as vehicles for dissemination within the host.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1153.pdf,"[( 04 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 24 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

As such, divergence and copy number variants at these genes is found to be high between species. Within populations, positive and balancing selection are to be expected if plants coevolve with their pathogens. In order to understand the complexity of R-gene coevolution in wild non-model species, it is necessary to identify the full range of NLRs and infer their evolutionary history.

We use a combination of enrichment sequencing and pooling of ten individuals, to specifically sequence NLR genes in a resource and cost-effective manner. We focus on the effects which different of mapping and SNP calling software and settings have on calling polymorphisms in customized pooled samples. Our results are accurately verified using Sanger sequencing of polymorphic gene fragments. Our results indicate that some NLRs, namely 13 out of 220, have maintained polymorphism within our S. pennellii population.

On hypothermic increase of firing level spike responses of soma to iontophoretic application of glutamate to dendritic locus appeared with shorter latencies and with longer latencies on hypothermic decrease of spontaneous activity. At the same time hypothermia did not influence on the evoked spike reactions to iontophoretic application of glutamate straight to the soma. It means that hypothermic disorders of neuronal activity are not connected with changes in sensitivity to glutamate but determined by changes of amplitude of glutamatergic excitation while propagating along dendritic branches. The changes in spontaneous activity began at 30°C along with the decreased spike reactions to iontophoretic applications of acetylcholine and efficacy of dendro-somatic propagation. At the same temperature the fall of spike amplitude was initiated and increased with further hypothermia. It is proposed that the basis for hypothermic changes of neuronal activity is the decreased rate of M-cholinergic process at 27-29°C which leads both to attenuation of conductive function of dendrites and imbalance of K+ ion homeostasis.

The result is made possible by the interplay between spatial constraints and the essentiality of the shared resource. We validate this counter-intuitive effect by carefully combining theory and experiment, with the engineering of an explicit synthetic community in which the public compound allows survival to a bactericidal stress. Notably, the characterization of the experimental system identifies additional factors that can matter, like the impact of the lag phase on the tolerance to stress, or the appearance of spontaneous mutants.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the Shigellae, particularly as a specific multidrug resistant (MDR) lineage of Shigella sonnei (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for Shigella infections. However, ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei are being increasingly isolated in Asia, and sporadically reported on other continents. 
Methods and Findings
Hypothesising that Asia is the hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei, we performed whole genome sequencing on a collection of contemporaneous ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei isolated in six countries from within and outside of Asia. We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny we found that all ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of Lineage III. Further, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within S. sonnei can be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the USA and Europe. 
Conclusions
This study shows that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial resistant S. sonnei, and provides a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative community acquired pathogens spread globally.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Medicine/PLOS Medicine2.pdf,"[( 10 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 20 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 14 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 07 May 2016 , 1), ( 13 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 21 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 14 Nov 2017 , 1), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 25 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 08 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 28 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 27 Feb 2016 , 6)]"

While it is widely recognized that horizontal gene acquisitions frequently encompass multiple genes, it is currently unclear what the size distribution of successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces shape this distribution. Here, we identified 7,538 gene pairs that were consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli strains. These pairs are significantly enriched in genes that share the same GO annotation. We estimated the genomic distances of these co-gained pairs at the time they were transferred to their host genomes, which shows a sharp upper bound at 30kb. This upper bound is significantly lower than the size limit on gene co-transfers imposed by the carrying capacity of the transfer agents. The observed distance distribution also appears inconsistent with a model based on the co-transfer of genes within operons; instead, we found that the distance distribution of co-transferred genes closely matches the distribution expected from the transfer of uber-operons, i.e., genomic clusters of co-functioning genes beyond operons.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1157.pdf,"[( 09 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 25 Feb 2016 , 7)]"

We have used multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly characterize (with free energy profiles and calculated rates) the internal proton transport events that enable pumping and chemistry during the A→PR→F transition in the aa3-type CcO. Our results show that proton transport from amino acid residue E286 to both the pump loading site (PLS) and to the binuclear center (BNC) are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer from heme a to the BNC, but that the former (i.e., pumping) is kinetically favored while the latter (i.e., transfer of the chemical proton) is rate-limiting. The calculated rates are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. The back flow of the pumped proton from the PLS to E286 and from E286 to the inner side of membrane are prevented by the fast reprotonation of E286 through the D-channel and large free energy barriers for the back flow reactions. Proton transport from E286 to the PLS through the hydrophobic cavity (HC) and from D132 to E286 through the D-channel are found to be strongly coupled to dynamical hydration changes in the corresponding pathways.

Ted,  University of Alberta), (Berry, Fred B,  University of Alberta)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/041012 ,"Somitogenesis is a fundamental segmentation process that forms the vertebrate body plan. A network of transcription factors is essential in establishing the spatial temporal order of this process. One such transcription factor is mesp-ba which has an important role in determining somite boundary formation. Its expression in somitogenesis is tightly regulated by the transcriptional activator Tbx6 and the repressor Ripply1 via a feedback regulatory network. Loss of foxc1a function in zebrafish leads to lack of anterior somite formation and reduced mesp-ba expression. Here we examine how foxc1a interacts with the tbx6-ripply1 network to regulate mesp-ba expression. In foxc1a morphants, anterior somites did not form at 12.5 hours post fertilization (hpf). At 22 hpf posterior somites formed, whereas anterior somites remained absent. In ripply1 morphants, no somites were observed at any time point. The expression of mesp-ba was reduced in the foxc1a morphants and expanded anteriorly in ripply1 morphants. The tbx6 expression domain was smaller and shifted anteriorly in the foxc1a morphants. Double knockdown of foxc1a and ripply1 resulted in absence of anterior somite formation while posterior somites did form, suggesting a partial rescue of the ripply1 phenotype. However, unlike the single foxc1a morphants, expression of mesp-ba was restored in the anterior PSM. Expression of tbx6 was expanded anteriorly in the double morphants. In conclusion, both foxc1a and ripply1 morphants displayed defects in somitogenesis, but their individual loss of function had opposing effects on mesp-ba expression. Loss of ripply1 appears to have rescued the mesp-ba expression in the foxc1a morphant, suggesting that intersection of these parallel regulatory mechanisms is required for normal mesp-ba expression and somite formation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1159.pdf,"[( 25 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 24 Feb 2016 , 4), ( 23 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

Genetics plays an important role in coronary heart disease (CHD) but the clinical utility of a genomic risk score (GRS) relative to clinical risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), is unclear. 

Methods 
We generated a GRS of 49,310 SNPs based on a CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium meta-analysis of CHD, then independently tested this using five prospective population cohorts (three FINRISK cohorts, combined n=12,676, 757 incident CHD events; two Framingham Heart Study cohorts (FHS), combined n=3,406, 587 incident CHD events).

Results
The GRS was strongly associated with time to CHD event (FINRISK HR=1.74, 95% CI 1.61-1.86 per S.D. of GRS; Framingham HR=1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.38), and was largely unchanged by adjustment for clinical risk scores or individual risk factors, including family history. Integration of the GRS with clinical risk scores (FRS and ACC/AHA13 score) improved prediction of CHD events within 10 years (meta-analysis C-index: +1.5-1.6%, P<0.001), particularly for individuals ≥60 years old (meta-analysis C-index: +4.6-5.1%, P<0.001). Men in the top 20% of the GRS had 3-fold higher risk of CHD by age 75 in FINRISK and 2-fold in FHS, and attaining 10% cumulative CHD risk 18y earlier in FINRISK and 12y earlier in FHS than those in the bottom 20%. Furthermore, high genomic risk was partially compensated for by low systolic blood pressure, low cholesterol level, and non-smoking.

We include the effect of spatial correlations by deriving a system of ordinary differential equations that describe the expected evolution of individual and pair density functions for agents on a growing domain.

Here we present the first systematic investigation of this hierarchy, based on a network including twenty thousand experimentally determined interactions between RBPs and bound RBP mRNAs. RBPs bind their mRNA in half of the cases, providing conclusive evidence of their general propensity to autoregulation. The RBP regulatory network is dominated by directional chains, rather than by modular communities as in the transcription factor regulatory network. These chains are initiated by an essential class of RBPs, the iRBPs. One of these, RBMX, initiates several thousand chains reaching most human RBPs.

To investigate the role of N. crassa H1, we constructed a functional FLAG-tagged H1 fusion protein and performed genomic and molecular analyses. Cell fractionation experiments showed that H1-FLAG is a chromatin binding protein. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that H1-3XFLAG is globally enriched throughout the genome with a subtle preference for promoters of expressed genes.

Deletion of hH1 did not significantly impact nucleosome positioning or nucleosome occupancy. Analysis of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq) revealed a modest but global increase in DNA methylation in the ∆hH1 mutant.

We show that auditory cortical plasticity and retrieval learning are impaired in MeCP2het. Specifically, normal MECP2 expression in the adult auditory cortex is required for efficient retrieval learning. In wild-type mice, cohabitation with a mother and her pups triggered transient changes to auditory cortical inhibitory networks, including elevated levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67. However, MeCP2het further exhibited increased expression of parvalbumin (PV) and perineuronal nets (PNNs), events thought to suppress plasticity at the closure of critical periods and in adult learning. Averting these events with genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the GABAergic network restored retrieval behavior.

In contrast, bpp can reliably delimit species in such situations with only one locus and rarely supports a wrong assignment with high posterior probability.  While under-sampling or rare specimens may pose problems for heuristic methods, bpp can delimit species with high power when multi-locus data are used, even if the species is represented by a single specimen.

Methods: Using the results of genome-wide association studies, we develop a doubly-weighted GRS for the prediction of T2D risk, aiming to capture the effect of 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms.  The GRS is evaluated in the Estonian Biobank cohort (n=10273), analysing its effect on prevalent and incident T2D, while adjusting for other predictors.  We assessed the effect of GRS on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and its association with other T2D risk factors, and conducted the reclassification analysis.
Results: The adjusted hazard for incident T2D is 1.90 (95% CI 1.48, 2.44) times higher and for cardiovascular mortality 1.27 (95% CI 1.10, 1.46) times higher in the highest GRS quintile compared to the rest of the cohort. No significant association between BMI and GRS is found in T2D-free individuals. Adding GRS to the prediction model for 5-year T2D risks results in continuous Net Reclassification Improvement of 0.26 (95% CI 0.15, 0.38).
Conclusion: The proposed GRS would considerably improve the accuracy of T2D risk prediction when added to the set of predictors used so far.

The low level of Cdk activity not only allows cell cycle progression, but also forces cell cycle exit at a decision point in G2 phase. We find that Cdk activity stimulates p21 production, leading to nuclear sequestration of Cyclin B1, subsequent APC/CCdh1-dependent degradation of mitotic inducers and induction of senescence. We suggest that the same activity that triggers mitosis in an unperturbed cell cycle drives senescence in the presence of DNA damage, ensuring a robust response when most needed.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Aging Cell/Aging Cell1.pdf,"[( 29 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 01 Mar 2016 , 9)]"

Both of these cognitive constructs require a similar inference about the underlying situation or ""latent cause"" that generates our observations at any given time. The statistically optimal solution to this inference problem is to use Bayes rule to compute a posterior probability distribution over latent causes. To test whether such a posterior probability distribution is represented in the OFC, we tasked human participants with inferring a probability distribution over four possible latent causes, based on their observations. Using fMRI pattern similarity analyses, we found that BOLD activity in OFC is best explained as representing the (log-transformed) posterior distribution over latent causes. Furthermore, this pattern explained OFC activity better than other task-relevant alternatives such as the most probable latent cause, the most recent observation, or the uncertainty over latent causes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Neuroscience/Journal of Neuroscience10.pdf,"[( 29 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 01 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 30 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 21 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 25 Apr 2016 , 4), ( 05 Mar 2016 , 4)]"

Based on genome-wide SNP capture data, we find that mice from forested habitats in the eastern and western parts of their range form separate clades, suggesting that increased tail length evolved independently from a short-tailed ancestor. Two major changes in skeletal morphology can give rise to longer tails--increased number and increased length of vertebrae--and we find that forest mice in the east and west have both more and longer caudal vertebrae, but not trunk vertebrae, than nearby prairie forms. Using a second-generation intercross between a prairie and forest pair, we show that the number and length of caudal vertebrae are not correlated in this recombinant population, suggesting that variation in these traits is controlled by separate genetic loci.

Ectothermic animals, such as insects, use behavioural thermoregulation to keep their body temperature within suitable limits. It may be particularly important at warm margins of species occurrence, where populations are sensitive to increasing air temperatures. In the field, we studied thermal requirements and behavioural thermoregulation in low-altitude populations of the Satyrinae butterflies Erebia aethiops, E. euryale and E. medusa. We compared the relationship of individual body temperature with air and microhabitat temperatures for the low-altitude Erebia species to our data on seven mountain species, including a high-altitude population of E. euryale, studied in the Alps. We found that the grassland butterfly E. medusa was well adapted to the warm lowland climate and it was active under the highest air temperatures and kept the highest body temperature of all species. Contrarily, the woodland species, E. aethiops and a low-altitude population of E. euryale, kept lower body temperatures and did not search for warm microclimates as much as other species. Furthermore, temperature-dependence of daily activities also differed between the three low-altitude and the mountain species. Lastly, the different responses to ambient temperature between the low- and high-altitude populations of E. euryale suggest possible local adaptations to different climates. We highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for long-term species survival, because it is expected to buffer climate change consequences by providing a variety of microclimates, which can be actively explored by adults. Alpine species can take advantage of warm microclimates, while low-altitude grassland species may retreat to colder microhabitats to escape heat, if needed.

Thanks to next generation sequencing, forward genetic strategies can be expanded into a wider range of model organisms. The formation of secretory granules, called mucocysts, in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila relies in part on ancestral lysosomal sorting machinery but is also likely to involve novel factors. In prior work, multiple strains with defect in mucocyst biogenesis were generated by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, and characterized using genetic and cell biological approaches, but the genetic lesions themselves were unknown.  Here, we show that analyzing one such mutant by whole genome sequencing reveals a novel factor in mucocyst formation.  Strain UC620 has both morphological and biochemical defects in mucocyst maturation, a process analogous to dense core granule maturation in animals. Illumina sequencing of a pool of UC620 F2 clones identified a missense mutation in a novel gene called MMA1 (Mucocyst maturation).  The defects in UC620 were rescued by expression of a wildtype copy of MMA1, and disruption of MMA1 in an otherwise wildtype strain generated a phenocopy of UC620. The product of MMA1, characterized as a CFP-tagged copy, encodes a large soluble cytosolic protein. A small fraction of Mma1p-CFP is pelletable, which may reflect association with endosomes. The gene has no identifiable homologs except in other Tetrahymena species, and therefore represents an evolutionarily recent innovation that is required for granule maturation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics42.pdf,"[( 02 Mar 2016 , 4)]"

Unfortunately, however, what is only a maximum distance phenomenon was mistakenly transformed into a mutation rate phenomenon and became known as such. Previous work studied a small set of selected proteins. We have performed proteome wide studies of 7 different sets of proteomes involving a total of 15 species. All 7 sets showed that within each set of 3 species the least complex species is approximately equidistant in average proteome wide identity to the two more complex ones. Thus, the genetic equidistance result is a universal phenomenon of maximum distance.

We aimed to characterize the associations of usual alcohol consumption with a comprehensive systemic metabolite profile in young adults. 
Methods: Cross-sectional associations of alcohol intake with 86 metabolic measures were assessed for 9778 individuals from three population-based cohorts from Finland (age 24 45 years, 52% women). Metabolic changes associated with change in alcohol intake during 6-year follow-up were further examined for 1466 individuals. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaires. Circulating lipids, fatty acids and metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays.
Results: Increased alcohol intake was associated with cardiometabolic risk markers across multiple metabolic pathways, including higher lipid concentrations in HDL subclasses and smaller LDL particle size, increased proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, lower concentrations of glutamine and citrate (P<0.001 for 56 metabolic measures). Many metabolic biomarkers displayed U-shaped associations with alcohol consumption. Results were coherent for men and women, consistent across the three cohorts, and similar if adjusting for body mass index, smoking and physical activity. The metabolic changes accompanying change in alcohol intake during follow-up resembled the cross-sectional association pattern (R2=0.83, slope=0.72±0.04). 
Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is associated with a complex metabolic signature, including aberrations in multiple biomarkers for elevated cardiometabolic risk.

Results: We have developed vcfanno as a flexible toolset that simplifies the annotation of genetic variants in VCF format. Vcfanno can extract and summarize multiple attributes from one or more annotation files and append the resulting annotations to the INFO field of the original VCF file. Vcfanno also integrates the lua scripting language so that users can easily develop custom annotations and metrics. By leveraging a new parallel chromosome sweeping algorithm, it enables rapid annotation of both whole-exome and whole-genome datasets. We demonstrate this performance by annotating over 85.3 million variants in less than 17 minutes (>85,000 variants per second) with 50 attributes from 17 commonly used genome annotations.

Here we propose a new natural measure of the amount of epistasis based on the correlation of fitness effects of mutations. This measure has a natural interpretation, captures well the interaction between mutations and can be obtained analytically for most landscape models. We discuss how this measure is related to previous measures of epistasis (number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of sign epistasis, Fourier-Walsh spectrum) and how it can be easily extended to landscapes with missing data or with fitness ranks only. Furthermore, the dependence of the correlation of fitness effects on mutational distance contains interesting information about the patterns of epistasis.

One of the main contributors to auxin localization is the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that PIN1 genes are split into two sister clades; PIN1 and the relatively uncharacterized Sister-Of-PIN1 (SoPIN1). In this paper we identify entire-2 as a loss-of-function SlSoPIN1a (Solyc10g078370) mutant in Solanum lycopersicum. The entire-2 plants are unable to specify proper leaf initiation leading to a frequent switch from the wild type spiral phyllotactic pattern to distichous and decussate patterns. Leaves in entire-2 are large and less complex and the leaflets display spatial deformities in lamina expansion, vascular development, and margin specification. During sympodial growth in entire-2 the specification of organ position and identity is greatly affected resulting in variable branching patterns on the main sympodial and inflorescence axes. To understand how SlSoPIN1a functions in establishing proper auxin maxima we used the auxin signaling reporter DR5::Venus to visualize differences in auxin localization between entire-2 and wild type. DR5::Venus visualization shows a widening of auxin localization which spreads to subepidermal tissue layers during early leaf and flower organogenesis, showing that SoPIN1 functions to focus auxin signaling to the epidermal layer.

Evidence suggests that Zika virus has driven a 10-fold increase in babies born with microcephaly in Brazil, prompting the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. However, little is known about the natural history of infection. These data are critical for implementation of surveillance and control measures such as protecting the blood supply.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review and pooled analysis to estimate the distribution of times from Zika infection to symptom onset, seroconversion, and viral clearance, and analyzed their implications for surveillance and blood supply safety.  

Results
Based on 25 case reports, we estimate the median incubation period of Zika virus infection is 5.9 days (95% CI: 4.4-7.6), and that 95% of cases will develop symptoms by 11.1 days post-infection (95% CI: 7.6-18.0). On average seroconversion occurs 9.0 days (95% CI, 7.0-11.6) after infection, and virus is detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CI: 6.8-21.4). In 5% of cases detectable virus persists for over 18.9 days (95% CI: 12.6-79.5). The baseline (no screening) risk of a blood donation being infected with Zika increases by approximately 1 in 10,000 for every 1 per 100,000 person-days increase in Zika incidence. Symptom based screening reduces this by 7% (RR 0.93, 93% CI 0.86-0.99), and antibody screening by 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.28-0.88).

Symptom or antibody-based surveillance can do little to reduce the risk of Zika contaminated blood donations.

I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies.

This horizontal transmission strategy where hosts pair with locally available symbionts could serve to increase coral fitness across diverse environments, as long as hosts maintain high promiscuity and symbionts adapt locally. Here, we tested this hypothesis in two coral species by comparing host and symbiont genetic structures across different spatial scales in Micronesia. Each host species associated with two genetically distinct Symbiodinium lineages, confirming high promiscuity in broadly dispersing hosts. However, contrary to our initial expectation, symbiont genetic structure was independent of physical barriers to dispersal between islands, unlike genetic structure of their hosts that was nearly perfectly explained by ocean currents. Instead, Symbiodinium consistently demonstrated genetic divergence among local reefs and between the two host species at each island, although not necessarily between distant islands. These observations indicate that Symbiodiniumlineages disperse much more broadly than previously thought and continuously adapt to specific hosts and reef environments across their range, following the classical Baas Becking′s hypothesis: ″Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects″. Overall, our findings confirm that horizontal transmission could be a mechanism for broadly dispersing coral species to enhance their local fitness by associating with locally adapted symbionts. Dramatic differences in factors driving the genetic structures of horizontally-transmitting corals and their Symbiodinium imply that viewing their combined genomes as a single entity (′hologenome′) would not be useful in the context of their evolution and adaptation.

Here, we wish to know the number of executors for each trait, their relationships with the regulators and the role natural selection may play in shaping the regulator-executor-phenotype architecture.  By analyzing ~500 morphological traits of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we found that a trait is often controlled directly by a large number of executors, the expressions of which are affected by regulators.  By recruiting a set of ""coordinating"" regulators, natural selection helps organize the large number of executors into a small number of co-expression modules.  This way, the individual executors can be readily recognized by observational approaches that examine the statistical association between gene activity and trait.  When the trait is subject to little or no selection, however, the executors are controlled only by ""non-coordinating"" regulators that evolve passively and do not build the executors' co-expression.  As a result, none of the executors remain a statistically tractable relationship with the trait.

Lack of standard methods to genotype this region prevents it from being included in association studies and is holding back the growing field of antibody repertoire analysis.

The conditional manifestation of CGV has been claimed to explain the background dependence of causal loci as well as missing heritability. However, despite being proposed over 60 years ago, the genetic architecture and regulation of CGV and its contribution towards regulation of complex traits remains unclear. Using linkage mapping of mean and variance effects, we have identified loci that regulate phenotypic manifestation of standing genetic variation in a previously published dataset of biparental Saccharomyces cerevisiae population grown in 34 diverse environments. Based on our results we propose the existence of a gradient of buffering states for a population determined by the environment. Most environments show a tight buffering with additive, independent causal loci with little epistasis. However, as this buffering is disrupted, the underlying highly interconnected environment-specific genetic interactome is revealed such that each causal locus is a part of this network.

Current models studying the effects of resource competition assume a constant production of ribosomes and these models describe the experimental results well.  However, ribosomes are also autocatalytic since they are partially made of protein and autocatalysis has been shown to have detrimental effects on a system's stability and robustness. Additionally, there are known feedback regulations on ribosome synthesis such as inhibition of rRNA synthesis via ppGpp. Here, we develop two-state models of ribosome and protein synthesis incorporating autocatalysis and feedback to investigate conditions under which these regulatory actions have a significant effect in situations of increased ribosome demand. Our modeling results indicate that for sufficiently low demand, defined by the mRNA level of synthetic genes, autocatalysis has little or no effect. However, beyond a certain demand level, the system goes through a transcritical bifurcation at which the only non-negative steady state is at zero ribosome concentration.  The presence of negative feedback, in turn, can shift this point to higher demand values, thus restoring the qualitative behavior observed in a model with a constant ribosome production at low demand. However, autocatalysis affects the dynamics of the system and can lead to an overshoot in the temporal response of the synthetic genes to changes in induction level. Our results show that ribosome autocatalysis has a significant effect on the system robustness to increases in ribosome demand, however the existing negative feedback on ribosome production compensates for the effects of the necessary autocatalytic loop and restores the behavior seen in the system with constant ribosome production. These findings explain why previous models with constant ribosome production reproduce the steady state behavior well, however incorporating autocatalysis and feedback is needed to capture the transient behavior.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1184.pdf,"[( 04 Mar 2016 , 4)]"

Our results suggest that the size of a gene family is an important predictor of the RT distribution in close proximity to the family members. The distribution differs considerably between the three most common RT classes (LINEs, LTRs and SINEs). LINEs and LTRs tend to be more abundant around genes of multi-copy gene families, whereas SINEs tend to be depleted around such genes. Detailed analysis of the distribution and diversity of LINEs and LTRs with respect to gene family size suggests that each has a distinct involvement in gene family expansion. LTRs are associated with open chromatin sites surrounding the gene families, supporting their involvement in gene regulation, whereas LINEs may play a structural role, promoting gene duplication. This suggests that gene family expansions, especially in the mouse genome, might undergo two phases, the first is characterized by elevated deposition of LTRs and their utilization in reshaping gene regulatory networks. The second phase is characterized by rapid gene family expansion due to continuous accumulation of LINEs and it appears that, in some instances at least, this could become a runaway process. We provide an example in which this has happened and we present a simulation supporting the possibility of the runaway process.

The resulting primary transgenic individuals are typically heterozygous and/or chimeric with respect to any mutations induced. To generate genetically fixed mutants, they are conventionally allowed to self-pollinate, a procedure which segregates individuals into mutant heterozygotes/homozygotes and wild types. The chances of recovering homozygous mutants among the progeny depends not only on meiotic segregation but also on the frequency of mutated germline cells in the chimeric mother plant.

Results: RNA-guided endonuclease-mediated mutagenesis was targeted to the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) harboured by a transgenic tobacco line. Upon retransformation using a gfp-specific endonuclease construct, the T0 plants were allowed to either self-pollinate, or were propagated via regeneration from in vitro cultured embryogenic pollen which give rise to haploid/doubled haploid plants or from leaf explants that form plants vegetatively. Single or multiple mutations were detected in 80% of the T0 plants. The majority of these mutations proved heritable by each of the three propagation systems used. Regeneration from in vitro cultured embryogenic pollen allowed for homozygous mutants to be produced more efficiently than via sexual reproduction. The recovery of mutations that were not found among sexually produced progeny was shown to be achievable through vegetative plant propagation in vitro. In addition, a number of mutations not detected in the primary gRNA/Cas9-expressing plants were uncovered in the progeny, irrespective of the mode of propagation. 

Conclusion: Regeneration from embryogenic pollen culture provides a convenient method to rapidly generate a variety of genetically fixed mutants following site-directed mutagenesis. Induced mutations that are not sexually transmitted can be recovered through vegetative plant regeneration from somatic tissue.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1188.pdf,"[( 04 Mar 2016 , 5)]"

Bacterial culture test is the gold standard because it is inexpensive and does not require extensive sample preparation, and most importantly, provides all the necessary information sought by healthcare professionals, such as bacterial presence, viability and drug effectiveness.

Here, we solve this problem by monitoring the growth of bacteria in thousands of nanowells simultaneously to identify its presence in the sample and its viability, faster. The segmentation of a sample with low bacterial concentration into thousands of nanoliter wells digitizes the samples and increases the effective concentration in those wells that contain bacteria.  We monitor the metabolism of aerobic bacteria by using an oxygen sensitive fluorophore, ruthenium tris (2,2-diprydl) dichloride hexahydrate (RTDP) that allows us to monitor the dissolved oxygen concentration in the nanowells.

In large populations, selection against deleterious mutations has previously been shown to reduce variability at linked neutral loci (background selection). We describe analytical, numerical and simulation studies that shed light on the conditions under which retardation versus acceleration of loss of variability occurs at a neutral locus linked to a locus under selection. We consider a finite, randomly mating population initiated from an infinite population in equilibrium at a locus under selection, with no linkage disequilibrium. With mutation and selection, retardation only occurs when S, the product of twice the effective population size and the selection coefficient, is of order one. With S >> 1, background selection always causes an acceleration of loss of variability.

This genotype-driven perspective has led to significant advances in our understanding and treatment of diseases such as cancer e.g. the discovery of driver mutations and the development of molecularly-targeted therapeutics.  However, this perspective has largely ignored the functional outcome of genetic changes: the cellular phenotype. In part, this is simply because phenotypes are neither easy to define or measure as they critically depend on both genotype and context. Heterogeneity at the gene scale has been known for sometime, and there has been significant effort invested in trying to find patterns within it,  but much less is understood about how this heterogeneity manifests itself in phenotypic change, i.e. the genotype-phenotype map (GP-map). This mapping is not one-to-one but many-to-many and is fundamentally the junction at which both genes and environment meet to produce phenotypes. Many genotypes produce similar phenotypes, and multiple phenotypes can emerge from a single genotype. To further complicate matters, genetically identical cells in uniform environments still exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Therefore a central open question in biology today is how can we connect the abundance of genomic data with cell phenotypic behaviour, this is especially pertinent to the issue of treatment resistance as many therapies act on cellular phenotypes.

Our focus here is to tackle the GP-map question through the use of the simplest functional mapping we can define that also captures phenotypic heterogeneity: a molecular switch.  Molecular switches are ubiquitous in biology, observed in many organisms and naturally map molecular components to decisions (i.e. phenotypes).  Often stochastic in nature, such switches can be the difference between life or death in environments that fluctuate unpredictably, since they will ensure that at least some offspring are adapted to future environments.  For convenience we use Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) to define the map of gene products to phenotypes, allowing us to investigate the impact of distinct mappings (CRNs) and perturbations to them. We observe that key biological properties naturally emerge, including both robustness and persistence.  Robustness may explain why such bet hedging strategies are common in biology, and not readily destroyed through mutation. Whereas persistence may explain the apparent paradox of bet-hedging - why does phenotypic hedging exist in environments beneficial to only one of the phenotypes, when selection necessarily acts against it? The structure of the molecular switch, itself subject to selection, can slow the loss of hedging to ensure a survival mechanism even against environmental catastrophes which are very rare. Critically, these properties when taken together have profound and significant implications for the emergence of treatment resistance, since the timescale of extinction depends heavily on the underlying GP-map.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics63.pdf,"[( 14 Jul 2016 , 4), ( 14 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 22 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 22 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 05 Mar 2016 , 22), ( 07 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 08 Mar 2016 , 9), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

We separately consider cell populations that harbor pre-existing resistance to the drug, and those that acquire resistance during the course of treatment. For each of these independent scenarios, we consider one hypothetical cell line that is responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, and another that with high probability cannot be eradicated by a metronomic protocol. Motivated by experimental work on ovarian cancer xenografts, we consider all possible combinations of a one week treatment protocol, repeated for three weeks, and constrained by the total weekly drug dose. Simulations reveal a small number of fractionated-dose protocols that are at least as effective as metronomic therapy in eradicating micrometastases with acquired resistance (weak or strong), while also being at least as effective on those that harbor weakly pre-existing resistant cells. Given the responsiveness of very different theoretical cell lines to these few fractionated-dose protocols, these may represent more effective ways to schedule chemotherapy with the goal of limiting metastatic tumor progression.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering/Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering1.pdf,"[( 05 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

In most cases the infection is mild and transient, but the virus does appear to be strongly neurotropic and the presumptive cause of both birth defects in foetuses and Guillain-Barr&eacute syndrome in some adults. 

In this paper the techniques and utilities developed in the study of mitochondrial DNA are applied to the Zika virus. As a result it is possible to show in a simple manner how a phylogenetic tree may be constructed and how the mutation rate of the virus can be measured. 

The study shows the mutation rate to vary between 12 and 25 bases a year, in a viral genome of 10,272 bases. This rapid mutation rate will enable the geographic spread of the epidemic to be monitored easily and may also prove useful in assisting the identification of preventative measures that are working, and those which are not.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Zoological Research/Zoological Research1.pdf,"[( 10 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 21 Feb 2016 , 8), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 22 Feb 2016 , 5), ( 08 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 20 Feb 2016 , 9), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 3)]"

Abstract
Objective: Toanalyze the lipid profile in a population of young university students in relation with their BMI.
Methods: This study assessed 96 students with age between 18 and 31 years old who were classified according to their sex and their body mass index (BMI). The fastingserum submitted to lipid profile analysis, including serum level of total cholesterol (TC) , High(HDL-c) , triglycerides (TG)were measured by using enzymatic methodandNon HDLD and a fraction of cholesterol of low (LDL-c) which calculated  mathematically besides of life habits and atherogenic data . 
Results:The mean BMI (Kg/cm2) in male (27.75 5.76) is higher than the mean BMI in female (23.17  2.78), P value (0.0001). The mean total concentration of cholesterol, LDL-c and Non HDL (mg/dl) in males (165.88 32.20, 85.00  39.94, 105.09  34.22) respectively is less than in females (194.27  52.04, 125.32  50.39, 139.14 51.35) correspondingly. The mean total concentration of HDL-c and TG (61.97  13.29, 94.80   35.51) correspondingly. Lipid indices, total cholesterol/HDL, LDL/HDL and Non HDL/HDL in male (2.91  1.02, 1.50  0.86, 1.87 0.99) respectively are less than those in female (3.73  1.24, 2.47  1.24, 2.75  1.25).
Conclusions: The obesity of young males (25.00%) is more prevalence than the obesity of young females (2.28%). The risk concentration of total cholesterol,LDL-c and Non HDLand the lipid indices (Total cholesterol/HDL,LDL/HDL and Non HDL/HDL) are higher in females than males and this indicate that the young females have  more risk to develop cardiac problems in older ages .

Determining the cellular function of each kinesin would be greatly facilitated by specific small molecule inhibitors, but screens have yielded inhibitors that are specific to only a small number of kinesins, likely due to the high conservation of the kinesin motor domain across the superfamily. Here we present a chemical-genetic approach to engineer kinesin motors that retain microtubule-dependent motility in the absence of inhibitor yet can be efficiently inhibited by small, cell-permeable molecules. Using kinesin-1 as a prototype, we tested two independent strategies to design inhibitable motors. First, we inserted the six amino acid tetracysteine tag into surface loops of the motor domain such that binding of biarsenic dyes allosterically inhibits processive motility. Second, we fused DmrB dimerization domains to the motor heads such that addition of B/B homodimerizer cross-links the two motor domains and inhibits motor stepping. We show, using cellular assays that the engineered kinesin-1 motors are able to transport artificial and natural kinesin-1 cargoes, but are efficiently inhibited by the addition of the relevant small molecule. Single-molecule imaging in vitro revealed that inhibitor addition reduces the number of processively moving motors on the microtubule, with minor effects on motor run length and velocity. It is likely that these inhibition strategies can be successfully applied to other members of the kinesin superfamily due to the high conservation of the kinesin motor domain.

Specifically, we prove that, at stationarity, the hazard function of the distribution of waiting times until reversion is strictly decreasing for any such site. Thus, in the presence of epistasis, the longer a particular character has been absent from a site, the less likely the site will revert to its prior state.

Low birth weight and postnatal growth restriction are the most evident symptoms of dwarfism. Accompanying skeletal aberrations may compromise the general condition and locomotion of affected individuals. Several paternal half sibs with low birth weight and size were born in 2013 in the Fleckvieh cattle population.

Results
Affected calves were strikingly underweight at birth despite a normal gestation length and had craniofacial abnormalities such as elongated narrow heads and brachygnathia inferior. Despite a normal general condition, their growth remained restricted during rearing. We genotyped 27 affected and 10,454 unaffected animals at 44,672 SNPs and performed association testing followed by homozygosity mapping to map the growth failure to a 1.85 Mb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data from one affected and 289 unaffected animals revealed a 1bp deletion (g.15079217delC, rs723240647) in the coding region of the GON4L gene that segregated with the dwarfism-associated haplotype. We show that the deletion introduces intron retention and premature termination of translation, putatively resulting in a severely truncated protein that lacks domains that are likely essential to normal protein function. The widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination has resulted in a tenfold increase in the frequency of the deleterious allele in the female population.

Conclusions
A frameshift mutation in GON4L is associated with autosomal recessive proportionate dwarfism in Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation has segregated in the population for more than fifty years without being recognized as a genetic disorder. However, the widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination caused a sudden accumulation of homozygous calves with dwarfism.

Phase or SNP call errors in genomic data can degrade accuracy of IBD detection and lead to false positive calls, false negative calls, and under- or overextension of true IBD segments. Furthermore, the number of comparisons increases quadratically with sample size, requiring high computational efficiency. We developed a new IBD segment detection program, FISHR (Find IBD Shared Haplotypes Rapidly), in an attempt to accurately detect IBD segments and to better estimate their endpoints using an algorithm that is fast enough to be deployed on the very large whole-genome SNP datasets. We compared the performance of FISHR to three leading IBD segment detection programs: GERMLINE, refinedIBD, and HaploScore. Using simulated and real genomic sequence data, we show that FISHR is slightly more accurate than all programs at detecting long (greater than 3 cM) IBD segments but slightly less accurate than refinedIBD at detecting short (1 cM) IBD segments. Moreover, FISHR outperforms all programs in determining the true endpoints of IBD segments, which is important for several reasons. FISHR takes two to four times longer than GERMLINE to run, whereas both GERMLINE and FISHR were orders of magnitude faster than refinedIBD and HaploScore.

In this paper, we characterize ""normal"" and ""diseased"" states of the HPA axis as basins of attraction of a dynamical system describing the inhibition of peptide hormones such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by circulating glucocorticoids such as cortisol (CORT).  In addition to including key physiological features such as ultradian oscillations in cortisol levels and self-upregulation of CRH neuron activity, our model distinguishes the relatively slow process of cortisol-mediated CRH biosynthesis from rapid trans-synaptic effects that regulate the CRH secretion process.  Crucially, we find that the slow regulation mechanism mediates external stress-driven transitions between the stable states in novel, intensity, duration, and timing-dependent ways.  These results indicate that the timing of traumatic events may be an important factor in determining if and how patients will exhibit hallmarks of stress disorders. Our model also suggests a mechanism whereby exposure therapy of stress disorders such as PTSD may act to normalize downstream dysregulation of the HPA axis.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biology Direct/Biology Direct5.pdf,"[( 09 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

In Drosophila melanogaster, transcriptional output from the single male X-chromosome is equalized to that of XX females by recruitment of the Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex to specific sequences along the length of the X-chromosome.  The initial recruitment of MSL complex to the X-chromosome is dependent on a recently discovered zinc finger protein called Chromatin-Linked Adapter for MSL Proteins (CLAMP). However, further studies on the in vivo function of CLAMP remained difficult because the location of the gene in pericentric heterochromatin made it challenging to create null mutations or deficiencies. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system, we generated the first null mutant in the clamp gene that eliminates expression of CLAMP protein. We show that CLAMP is necessary for both male and female viability. While females die at the third instar larval stage, males die earlier, likely due to the essential role of CLAMP in male dosage compensation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CLAMP promotes dosage compensation in males and represses key male-specific transcripts involved in sex-determination in females. Our results reveal that CLAMP is an essential protein with dual roles in males and females, which together assure that dosage compensation is a sex-specific process.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1200.pdf,"[( 08 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 8)]"

Among the insects, most previous analyses of the roles of drift and selection in shaping variation across the genome have focused on the genus Drosophila. A more complete understanding of these forces will come from analysing other taxa that differ in population demography and other aspects of biology. We have analysed diversity and signatures of selection in the neotropical Heliconius butterflies using resequenced genomes from 58 wild-caught individuals of H. melpomene, and another 21 resequenced genomes representing 11 related species. By comparing intra-specific diversity and inter-specific divergence, we estimate that 31% of amino acid substitutions between Heliconius species are adaptive. Diversity at putatively neutral sites is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with recombination rate, indicating widespread linked selection. This process also manifests in significantly reduced diversity on longer chromosomes, consistent with lower recombination rates. Genetic hitchhiking around beneficial non-synonymous mutations has also had a significant impact on genetic variation in this species, but evidence for strong selective sweeps was limited overall. We did however identify two regions where distinct haplotypes have swept in different populations, leading to increased population differentiation. On the whole, our study suggests that positive selection is less pervasive in these butterflies as compared to fruit flies; a fact that curiously results in very similar levels of neutral diversity in these very different insects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics65.pdf,"[( 08 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 30 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 15 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 17), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 7)]"

However, the standard method for estimating variance components in LMMs -- the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method (REML) -- suffers from several important drawbacks: REML is computationally slow, requires individual-level genotypes and phenotypes, and produces biased estimates in case control studies. To remedy these drawbacks, we present an alternative framework for variance component estimation, which we refer to as MQS. MQS is based on the method of moments (MoM) and the minimal norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) criteria, and brings two seemingly unrelated methods -- the renowned Haseman-Elston (HE) regression and the recent LD score regression (LDSC) -- into the same unified framework. With this new framework, we provide an alternative but mathematically equivalent form of HE that allows for the use of summary statistics and is faster to compute. We also provide an exact estimation form of LDSC to yield unbiased and more accurate estimates with calibrated confidence intervals. A key feature of our method is that it can effectively use a small random subset of individuals for computation while still producing estimates that are almost as accurate as if the full data were used. As a result, our method produces unbiased and accurate estimates with calibrated standard errors, while it is computationally efficient for large data sets. Using simulations and applications to 33 phenotypes from 7 real data sets, we illustrate the benefits of our method for estimating and partitioning chip heritability.

We show that gbM correlates with breadth and abundance of transcription and with slow sequence evolution. We also show a strong correlation between gbM and codon bias due to systematic replacement of CpG bearing codons.

Intestinal mucus in particular serves as a physical barrier to pathogens, a medium for the diffusion of nutrients and metabolites, and an environmental home for colonizing microbes. Its rheological properties have therefore been the subject of many investigations, thus far limited, however, to in vitro studies due to the difficulty of measurement in the natural context of the gut.  This limitation especially hinders our understanding of how the gut microbiota interact with the intestinal environment, since examination of this calls not only for in vivo measurement techniques, but for techniques that can be applied to model organisms in which the microbial state of the gut can be controlled. We address this challenge by developing a method that combines magnetic microrheology, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and microgavage of particles, applying this to the larval zebrafish, a model vertebrate.  We present measurements of the viscosity of mucus within the intestinal bulb of both germ-free (devoid of intestinal microbes) and conventionally reared larval zebrafish. At the length scale probed (≈ 10 μ m), we find that mucus behaves as a Newtonian fluid, with no discernable elastic component. Surprisingly, despite known differences in the the number of secretory cells in germ-free zebrafish and their conventional counterparts, the fluid viscosity for these two groups was very similar. Our measurements provide the first in vivo measurements of intestinal mucus rheology at micron length scales in living animals, quantifying of an important biomaterial environment and highlighting the utility of active magnetic microrheology for biophysical studies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1202.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 19 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Basal angiosperm flowers had trait values associated with higher water and carbon costs than monocot and eudicot flowers.  Kflower was coordinated with water supply (vein length per area, VLA) and loss (minimum epidermal conductance, gmin) traits among the magnoliids, but was insensitive to variation in these traits among the monocots and eudicots. Phylogenetic independent contrast (PIC) correlations revealed that few traits had undergone coordinated evolution.  However, VLA and the desiccation time (Tdes), the quotient of water content and gmin, had significant trait and PIC correlations.  The near absence of stomata from monocot and eudicot flowers may have been critical in minimizing water loss rates among these clades.  Early-divergent, basal angiosperm flowers maintain higher Kflower due to traits associated with high rates water loss and water supply, while monocot and eudicot flowers employ a more conservative strategy of limiting water loss and may rely on stored water to maintain turgor and delay desiccation.","/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Plant, Cell and Environment/Plant, Cell and Environment2.pdf","[( 28 Oct 2015 , 5), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

While the range of the virus has been cataloged growing slowly over the last 50 years, the recent explosive expansion in the Americas indicates that the full potential distribution of Zika remains uncertain. Moreover, most current epidemiology relies on its similarities to dengue fever, a phylogenetically closely related disease of unknown similarity in spatial range or ecological niche. Here we compile the first spatially explicit global occurrence dataset from Zika viral surveillance and serological surveys, and construct ecological niche models to test basic hypotheses about its spread and potential establishment. The hypothesis that the outbreak of cases in Mexico and North America are anomalous and outside the ecological niche of the disease, and may be linked to El Nino or similar climatic events, remains plausible at this time. Comparison of the Zika niche against the known distribution of dengue fever suggests that Zika is more constrained by the seasonality of precipitation and diurnal temperature fluctuations, likely confining the disease to the tropics outside of pandemic scenarios. Projecting the range of the diseases in conjunction with vector species (Aedes africanus, Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus) that transmit the pathogens, under climate change, suggests that Zika has potential for northward expansion; but, based on current knowledge, Zika is unlikely to fill the full range its vectors occupy. With recent sexual transmission of the virus known to have occurred in the United States, we caution that our results only apply to the vector-borne aspect of the disease, and while the threat of a mosquito-carried Zika pandemic may be overstated in the media, other transmission modes of the virus may emerge and facilitate naturalization worldwide. ",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases6.pdf,"[( 12 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 21 Feb 2016 , 5), ( 20 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 20 Feb 2016 , 7), ( 23 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to cell cycle progression, origin recognition complex (ORC) binding, pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC) assembly, and activation of replication origins. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S-phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which could be partially attributed to a defect in pre-RC formation and origin activity. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. Using Drosophila Kc167 cells, we employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and governing genome stability. We find that depletion of Drosophila PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 result in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. The cell cycle arrest occurs during the second S phase following loss of PR-Set7 activity, suggesting that accumulation of nascent H4K20 is recalcitrant to the DNA replication program. Deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome; instead, we found that the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated H2A.v (γ-H2A.v), accumulated specifically in late replicating domains in the absence of PR-Set7.

We used the Avida digital evolution research platform to overcome this barrier and study the response of phenotypic diversity to eight different reserve placement configurations. The capacity for mutation,and therefore evolution, substantially altered the dynamics of diversity in the population. When mutations were allowed, reserve configurations involving a greater number of consequently smaller reserves were substantially more effective at maintaining existing diversity and generating new diversity.

Identifying the genetic basis of brain evolution has become a major tool in answering this question. Numerous cases of positive selection, altered gene expression or gene duplication have been identified that may contribute to the evolution of the neocortex, which is widely assumed to play a predominant role in cognitive evolution.  However, the neocortex co-evolves with other, functionally inter-dependent, regions of the brain, most notably the cerebellum. The cerebellum is linked to a range of cognitive tasks and expanded rapidly during hominoid evolution, independently of neocortex size. Here we demonstrate that, across primates, genes with known roles in cerebellum development are just as likely to be targeted by selection as genes linked to cortical development. In fact, cerebellum genes are more likely to have evolved adaptively during hominoid evolution, consistent with phenotypic data suggesting an accelerated rate of cerebellar expansion in apes. Finally, we present evidence that selection targeted genes with specific effects on either the neocortex or cerebellum, not both.

We show theoretically that increasing the landscape resource autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the average speed of species spread. Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is streghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction in the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments with the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats characterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and experimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic stochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended landscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial distributions of resources controlling vital rates.

Whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in pedigreed macaque colonies could provide substantial experimental power, but the collection of WGS data in large cohorts remains a formidable expense.  Here, we describe a cost-effective approach that selects the most informative macaques in a pedigree for whole-genome sequencing, and imputes these dense marker data into all remaining individuals having sparse marker data, obtained using Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS). 
Results:  We developed GBS for the macaque genome using a single digest with PstI, followed by sequencing to 30X coverage.  From GBS sequence data collected on all individuals in a 16-member pedigree, we characterized an optimal 22,455 sparse markers spaced ~125 kb apart.  To characterize dense markers for imputation, we performed WGS at 30X coverage on 9 of the 16 individuals, yielding ~10.2 million high-confidence variants.  Using the approach of Genotype Imputation Given Inheritance (GIGI), we imputed alleles at an optimized dense set of 4,920 variants on chromosome 19, using 490 sparse markers from GBS.  We assessed changes in accuracy of imputed alleles, 1) across 3 different strategies for selecting individuals for WGS, i.e., a) using GIGI-Pick to select informative individuals, b) sequencing the most recent generation, or c) sequencing founders only; and 2) when using from 1-9 WGS individuals for imputation.  We found that accuracy of imputed alleles was highest using the GIGI-Pick selection strategy (median 92%), and improved very little when using >4 individuals with WGS for imputation.  We used this ratio of 4 WGS to 12 GBS individuals to impute an expanded set of ~14.4 million variants across all 20 macaque autosomes, achieving ~85-88% accuracy per chromosome.
Conclusions:  We conclude that an optimal tradeoff exists at the ratio of 1 individual selected for WGS using the GIGI-Pick algorithm, per 3-5 relatives selected for GBS, a cost savings of ~67-83% over WGS of all individuals.

Unlike blood, the CSF does not flow rapidly through a network of dedicated vessels, but rather through peri-vascular channels and brain parenchyma in a slower time-domain, and thus conventional fMRI or other blood-flow sensitive MRI sequences do not provide much useful information about the desired flow patterns. We have accordingly analyzed a series of MRI images, taken at different times, of the brain of a live rat, which was injected with a paramagnetic tracer into the CSF via the lumbar intrathecal space of the spine. Our goal is twofold: (a) find glymphatic (tracer) flow directions in the live rodent brain; and (b) provide a model of a (healthy) brain that will allow the prediction of tracer concentrations given initial conditions. We model the liquid flow through the brain by the diffusion equation.

This may lead, over time, to reduced average fitness in the population. In that sense, selection is more ‘effective’ in larger populations. Many recent studies have considered whether the different demographic histories across human populations have resulted in differences in the number, distribution, and severity of deleterious variants, leading to an animated debate. 
This article seeks to clarify some terms of the debate by identifying differences in definitions and assumptions used in these studies and providing an intuitive explanation for the observed similarity in genetic load among populations.  The intuition is verified through analytical and numerical calculations. First, even though rare variants contribute to load, they contribute little to load differences across populations. Second, the accumulation of non-recessive load after a bottleneck is slow for the weakly deleterious variants that contribute much of the long-term variation among populations. Whereas a bottleneck increases drift instantly, it affects selection only indirectly, so that fitness differences can keep accumulating long after a bottleneck is over. Third, drift and selection tend to have opposite effects on load differentiation under dominance models.  Because of this competition, load differences across populations depend sensitively and intricately on past demographic events and on the distribution of fitness effects. A given bottleneck can lead to increased or decreased load for variants with identical fitness effects, depending on the subsequent population history. Because of this sensitivity, both classical population genetic intuition and detailed simulations are required to understand differences in load across populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1213.pdf,"[( 12 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 01 Nov 2014 , 1), ( 14 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 31 Oct 2014 , 12), ( 01 Dec 2016 , 1), ( 03 Nov 2014 , 1), ( 30 Oct 2014 , 2)]"

As melanopsin occurs in at least two states, a resting and a firing state, a basic model is defined by a non-stationary two state hidden Markov process. Subsequently we add complexities in the form of (1) an hierarchical extension to fit multiple cells; (2) a wavelength dependency, to investigate the response at different color of light stimulation; (3) an additional third state to investigate whether melanopsin is bi- or tri-stable; (4) differences between different sub-types of melanopsin as found in different species. This application of modeling melanopsin dynamics demonstrates several benefits of Bayesian methods. They directly model uncertainty of parameters, are flexible in the distributions and relations of parameters in the modeling, and allow including prior knowledge, for example parameter values based on biochemical data.

Motivated by recent studies identifying a chemically diverse array of lysine acyl modifications in vivo, we examined the acyl chain specificity of the acetyltransferase, human Gcn5 (Gcn5L2). Whereas Gcn5L2 robustly catalyzes lysine acetylation, the acyltransferase activity of Gcn5L2 gets progressively weaker with increasing acyl chain length. To understand how Gcn5 discriminates between different acyl-CoA molecules, we determined structures of the catalytic domain of human Gcn5L2 bound to propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA. Although the active site of Gcn5L2 can accommodate propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA without major structural rearrangements, butyryl-CoA adopts a conformation incompatible with catalysis that obstructs the path of the incoming lysine residue and acts as a competitive inhibitor for Gcn5L2 versus acetyl-CoA. These structures demonstrate how Gcn5L2 discriminates between acyl chain donors and explain why Gcn5L2 has weak activity for acyl moieties that are larger than an acetyl group.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Acta Crystallographica Section D/Acta Crystallographica Section D3.pdf,"[( 12 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

We use DTI data to estimate structural connectivity and subsequently model phase couplings from band-limited oscillatory signals derived from multichannel EEG data. Our results show that about 23.4% of the variance in empirical networks of resting-state fast oscillations is explained by the underlying white matter architecture. By simulating functional connectivity using a simple reference model, the match between simulated and empirical functional connectivity further increases to 45.4%. In a second step, we use our modeling framework to explore several technical alternatives along the modeling path. First, we find that an augmentation of homotopic connections in the structural connectivity matrix improves the link to functional connectivity while a correction for fiber distance slightly decreases the performance of the model. Second, a more complex computational model based on Kuramoto oscillators leads to a slight improvement of the model fit. Third, we show that the comparison of modeled and empirical functional connectivity at source level is much more specific for the underlying structural connectivity. However, different source reconstruction algorithms gave comparable results. Of note, as the fourth finding, the model fit was much better if zero-phase lag components were preserved in the empirical functional connectome, indicating a considerable amount of functionally relevant synchrony taking place with near zero or zero-phase lag. The combination of the best performing alternatives at each stage in the pipeline results in a model that explains 54.4% of the variance in the empirical EEG functional connectivity.

Sometimes this regulation is absent or different, which likely is the result of interactions with other post-transcriptional factors, particularly RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Despite the importance of the interactions between RBPs and miRNAs, little is known about how they affect post-transcriptional regulation in a global scale. In this study, we have analyzed CLIP datasets of 49 RBPs in HEK293 cells with the aim of understanding the interplay between RBPs and miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation. Our results show that RBPs bind preferentially in conserved regulatory hotspots that frequently contain miRNA target sites. This organization facilitates the competition and cooperation among RBPs and the regulation of miRNA target site accessibility. In some cases RBP enrichment on target sites correlates with miRNA expression, suggesting coordination between the regulatory factors. However, in most cases, competition among factors is the most plausible interpretation of our data. Upon AGO2 knockdown, transcripts that contain such hotspots that overlap target sites of expressed miRNAs in 3′UTRs are significantly less up-regulated than transcripts without them, suggesting that RBP binding limits miRNA accessibility. In conclusion, we show that RBP binding is concentrated in regulatory hotspots in 3′UTRs. The presence of these hotspots facilitates the interaction among post-transcriptional regulators, that interact or compete with each other under different conditions. These hotspots are enriched in genes with regulatory functions such as DNA binding and RNA binding.

A key challenge in the emerging field of single-cell RNA-Seq is to characterize phenotypic diversity between cells and visualize this information in an informative manner. A common technique when dealing with high-dimensional data is to project the data to 2 or 3 dimensions for visualization.  However, there are a variety of methods to achieve this result and once projected, it can be difficult to ascribe biological significance to the observed features.  Additionally, when analyzing single-cell data, the relationship between cells can be obscured by technical confounders such as variable gene capture rates.

Results:
To aid in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell RNA-Seq data, we have developed FastProject, a software tool which analyzes a gene expression matrix and produces a dynamic output report in which two-dimensional projections of the data can be explored.  Annotated gene sets (referred to as gene 'signatures') are incorporated so that features in the projections can be understood in relation to the biological processes they might represent.  FastProject provides a novel method of scoring each cell against a gene signature so as to minimize the effect of missed transcripts as well as a method to rank signature-projection pairings so that meaningful associations can be quickly identified. Additionally, FastProject is written with a modular architecture and designed to serve as a platform for incorporating and comparing new projection methods and gene selection algorithms.

Conclusions:
Here we present FastProject, a software package for two-dimensional visualization of single cell data, which utilizes a plethora of projection methods and provides a way to systematically investigate the biological relevance of these low dimensional representations by incorporating domain knowledge.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics26.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 25 May 2016 , 1), ( 07 Aug 2017 , 1), ( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 19 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 13 Mar 2016 , 7), ( 22 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 15 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

We use coalescent simulations to investigate if molecular data provide enough information to distinguish between secondary contact following range expansion and an alternative evolutionary scenario consisting of a barrier to gene flow in an isolation-by-distance model. Although evidence for secondary contact is usually conveyed by statistics related to admixture coefficients, we find that they have no power to make the distinction. By contrast, the directionality index ψ that was proposed to study range expansion is informative.

One of the primary drivers of STR genotyping errors are “stutter” artifacts arising during the PCR amplification step of library preparation that add or delete copies of the repeat unit in observed sequencing reads. Recently, Illumina developed the TruSeq PCR-free library preparation protocol which eliminates the PCR step and theoretically should reduce stutter error. Here, I compare two high coverage whole genome sequencing datasets prepared with and without the PCR-free protocol. I find that this protocol reduces the percent of reads due to stutter by more than four-fold and results in higher confidence STR genotypes. Notably, stutter at homopolymers was decreased by more than 6-fold, making these previously inaccessible loci amenable to STR calling.

Several factors have been invoked to explain the 'missing heritability', including epistasis. Accounting for all possible epistatic interactions is computationally complex and requires very large samples. Here, we propose a simple two-state epistasis model, in which individuals show either high or low variant penetrance with respect to a certain trait.

Using polymer simulations, we show that this model can produce TADs as determined by our analyses of Hi-C data. Contrary to typical illustrations, each TAD consists of multiple dynamically formed loops, rather than a single static loop. Our model explains diverse experimental observations, including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments, and makes specific predictions for depletion of CTCF versus cohesin.

Many transcription factors initiate transcription only in specific sequence contexts, providing the means for sequence specificity of transcriptional control. A four-letter DNA alphabet only partially describes the possible diversity of nucleobases a transcription factor might encounter. For instance, cytosine is often present in a covalently modified form: 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5mC can be successively oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Just as transcription factors distinguish one unmodified nucleobase from another, some have been shown to distinguish unmodified bases from these covalently modified bases. Modification-sensitive transcription factors provide a mechanism by which widespread changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation can dramatically shift active gene expression programs.

Methods. To understand the effect of modified nucleobases on gene regulation, we developed methods to discover motifs and identify transcription factor binding sites in DNA with covalent modifications. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T alphabet, adding m (5mC) h (5hmC), f (5fC), and c (5caC). We additionally add symbols to encode guanine complementary to these modified cytosine nucleobases, as well as symbols to represent states of ambiguous modification. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix model of transcription factor binding affinity to an expanded alphabet. We developed a program, Cytomod, to create a modified sequence. We also enhanced the MEME Suite to be able to handle custom alphabets. These versions permit users to specify new alphabets, anticipating future alphabet expansions.

Results. We created an expanded-alphabet sequence using whole-genome maps of 5mC and 5hmC in naive ex vivo mouse T cells. Using this sequence and ChIP-seq data from Mouse ENCODE and others, we identified modification-sensitive cis-regulatory modules. We elucidated various known methylation binding preferences, including the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBPβ for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. We demonstrated that our method is robust to parameter perturbations, with transcription factors' sensitivities for methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA broadly conserved across a range of modified base calling thresholds. Hypothesis testing across different threshold values was used to determine cutoffs most suitable for further analyses. Using these known binding preferences to tune model parameters enables discovery of novel modified motifs.

Discussion. Hypothesis testing of motif central enrichment provides a natural means of differentially assessing modified versus unmodified binding affinity, without most of the limitations of a de novo analysis. This approach can be readily extended to other DNA modifications, provided genome-wide single-base resolution data is available. As more high-resolution epigenomic data becomes available, we expect this method to continue to yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across a variety of modifications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1223.pdf,"[( 17 May 2016 , 2), ( 13 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 03 Nov 2017 , 5), ( 24 Feb 2017 , 4), ( 23 Sep 2017 , 4), ( 21 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 13 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 17 Aug 2017 , 1), ( 07 Nov 2017 , 1), ( 17 Mar 2016 , 8), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 37), ( 24 Sep 2017 , 6), ( 18 May 2016 , 1), ( 05 May 2017 , 1), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 09 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 14 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 04 Feb 2017 , 4), ( 15 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 21 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 08 May 2017 , 1), ( 19 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 19 Aug 2017 , 1), ( 30 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 27 Oct 2016 , 6), ( 14 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 12 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 08 Mar 2017 , 2)]"

Functionally, immune priming is comparable to immune memory in vertebrates. Individuals that have survived exposure to a given parasite are better protected against subsequent exposures. Protection may be cross-reactive (e.g. [12]), but demonstrations of persistent and specific protection in invertebrates are increasing [3, 5]. This immune priming can cross generations (""trans-generational"" immune priming) [4, 8], preparing offspring for the prevailing parasite environment. While these phenomena gain increasing support, the mechanistic foundations underlying such immune priming, both within and across generations, remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptomic approach, we show a bacterial challenge to bumblebee queens, known to induce trans-generational immune priming, alters daughter (worker) gene expression. Daughters, even when unchallenged themselves, constitutively express a core set of the genes induced upon direct bacterial exposure, including high expression of antimicrobial peptides, a beta-glucan receptor protein implicated in bacterial recognition and the induction of the toll signaling pathway[13], and slit-3 which is important in honeybee immunity[14].  Maternal challenge results in a distinct upregulation of their daughters' immune system, with a signature overlapping with the induced individual response to a direct immune challenge. This will mediate mother-offspring protection, but also associated costs related to reconfiguration of constitutive immune expression. Identification of conserved immune pathways in memory-like responses has important implications for our understanding of the innate immune system, including the innate components in vertebrates, which share many of these pathways[15].",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1224.pdf,"[( 17 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 15 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 22 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

Currently, prognosis and outcome predictions are made based on clinical factors and/or by incorporating molecular profiling data. However, inaccurate prognosis and prediction may result by using only clinical or molecular information directly. One of the main shortcomings of past studies is the failure to incorporate prior biological information into the predictive model, given strong evidence of pathway-based genetic nature of cancer, i.e. the potential for oncogenes to be grouped into pathways based on biological functions such as cell survival, proliferation and metastatic dissemination.
To address this problem, we propose a two-stage procedure to incorporate pathway information into the prognostic modeling using large-scale gene expression data. In the first stage, we fit all predictors within each pathway using penalized Cox model (Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net) and Bayesian hierarchical Cox model. In the second stage, we combine the cross-validated prognostic scores of all pathways obtained in the first stage as new predictors to build an integrated prognostic model for prediction. We apply the proposed method to analyze breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), predicting overall survival using clinical data and gene expression profiling. The data includes ~20000 genes mapped into 109 pathways for 505 patients.

To that end we will focus on how the schizophrenia brain processes language and, particularly, on its distinctive oscillatory profile during language processing: We will argue that brain rhythms constitute the best route to interpret language deficits in this condition and map them to neural dysfunction and risk alleles of the genes. Additionally, we will show that candidate genes for schizophrenia are overrepresented among the set of genes that are believed are important for the evolution of human language. These genes crucially include (and are related to) genes involved in brain rhythmicity.

By analyzing numerical results, comparing to analytically derived EEG forward potentials and estimating computational complexity in spherical shell models, AA turns out to be essentially identical to PI. It is then proven that AA and PI are also algebraically identical even for general head models. This relation offers a direct link between the EEG forward problem and tCS. We then demonstrate how the quasi-analytical EEG forward solutions in sphere models can be used to validate the numerical accuracies of FEM-based tCS simulation approaches. These approaches differ with respect to the ease with which they can be employed for realistic head modeling based on MRI-derived segmentations. We show that while the accuracy of the most easy to realize approach based on regular hexahedral elements is already quite high, it can be significantly improved if a geometry-adaptation of the elements is employed in conjunction with an isoparametric FEM approach. While the latter approach does not involve any additional difficulties for the user, it reaches the high accuracies of surface-segmentation based tetrahedral FEM, which is considerably more difficult to implement and topologically less flexible in practice.

Here we study the fixation of underdominant alleles at loci that also influence mate choice, such as loci encoding coloration patterns visible to mates and predators alike. We analyze a mechanistic model of positive assortative mating in which individuals have n chances to sample compatible mates. This one-parameter model naturally spans the two classical extremes of random mating (n=1) and complete assortment (n → ∞), and yet it produces a complex form of sexual selection that depends non-monotonically on the number of mating opportunities, n. The resulting interaction between viability selection and sexual selection can either inhibit or facilitate fixation of underdominant alleles, compared to random mating.  As the number of mating opportunities increases, underdominant alleles can fix at rates that even approach the neutral substitution rate. This result is counterintuitive because sexual selection and underdominance each suppress rare alleles in this model, and yet in combination they can promote the fixation of rare alleles.  This phenomenon constitutes a new mechanism for the fixation of underdominant alleles in large populations, and it illustrates how incorporating life history characteristics can alter the predictions of population-genetic models for evolutionary change.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Theoretical Population Biology/Theoretical Population Biology9.pdf,"[( 08 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 04 Mar 2016 , 10), ( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 03 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

The ascending reticular activating system (RAS) represents a powerful set of endogenous neuromodulatory circuits that gate and tune global brain responses to internal and external cues, thereby regulating consciousness, alertness, and attention. The activity of two major RAS nuclei, the locus coeruleus (LC) and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), can be altered by trigeminal nerve modulation. Monosynaptic afferent inputs from the sensory components of trigeminal nerve branches project to the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TSNC), which has direct and polysynaptic connections to the LC and PPN. We previously found high-frequency (7 - 11 kHz) transdermal electrical neuromodulation (TEN) of the trigeminal nerve rapidly induces physiological relaxation, dampens sympathetic nervous system responses to acute stress, and suppresses levels of noradrenergic biomarkers. Given the established roles of LC and PPN neuronal activity in sleep regulation, psychophysiological arousal, and stress, we conducted three studies designed to test hypotheses that modulation of the TSNC can improve sleep quality and mood in healthy individuals (n = 99). Across a total of 1,386 days monitored, we observed TEN modulation of trigeminal and cervical nerves prior to sleep onset produced significant improvements in sleep quality and affective states, quantified using clinically validated surveys, overnight actigraph and heart rate recordings, and biochemical analyses compared to baseline or sham controls. Moreover, we observed some frequency dependence in that TEN delivered at lower frequencies (TENLF; 0.50 - 0.75 kHz) was significantly more effective at improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety than higher frequency TEN waveforms.

While many factors that regulate RhoA during cytokinesis have been characterized, the spatiotemporal regulatory logic remains undefined. It is not known whether a local zone of RhoA activity is sufficient to induce furrow formation or whether the spindle modulates furrow assembly through other pathways. Similarly, it is not known whether the entire cortex is responsive to RhoA, nor whether contractile ring assembly is cell cycle regulated. Here, we have developed an optogenetic probe to gain tight spatial and temporal control of RhoA activity in mammalian cells and demonstrate that cytokinetic furrowing is primarily regulated at the level of RhoA activation. Light-mediated recruitment of a RhoGEF domain to the plasma membrane leads to rapid activation of RhoA, leading to assembly of cytokinetic furrows that partially ingress. Furthermore, furrow formation in response to RhoA activation is not spatially or temporally restricted. RhoA activation is sufficient to generate furrows at both the cell equator and at cell poles, in both metaphase and anaphase. Remarkably, furrow formation can be initiated in rounded interphase cells, but not adherent cells.

The brain could solve this problem simply by always firing according to direction on the local (sloping) surface instead; however, if the animal moves between surfaces having different compass orientations then errors would accumulate in the subsequent azimuth signal. These errors could be avoided if the HD system instead combines two updating rules: yaw rotations around the D-V axis and rotations of the D-V axis around the gravity-defined vertical axis. We show here that when rats move between vertical walls of different orientations then HD cells indeed rotate their activity by an amount corresponding to the amount of vertical-axis rotation. With modelling, we then show how this reference-frame rotation, which may be driven by inputs from the vestibular nuclei or vestibulocerebellum, allows animals to maintain a simple yaw-based updating rule while on a given plane, but also to avoid accumulation of heading errors when moving between planes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1228.pdf,"[( 17 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 19)]"

This could potentially be overcome by using tissue culture techniques. However, plants regenerated from tissue culture may show aberrant phenotypes and “somaclonal” variation. Here we examined the effects of tissue culturing by clonal growth on the response to cold treatment in the photosynthetic efficiency (chlorophyll fluorescence measurements for Fv/Fm, Fv′/Fm′ and ФPSII, representing maximum efficiency of photosynthesis for dark- and light-adapted leaves, and the actual electron transport operating efficiency, respectively), compared to half-sibling seedlings from three different families of Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea. Somaclonal variation was limited and we could successfully detect within-family variation in change in chlorophyll fluorescence by cold shock with the help of tissue-culture derived replicates. Icelandic and Norwegian families exhibited higher chlorophyll fluorescence, suggesting higher cold tolerance, than a Swedish family. Although the main effect of tissue culture on Fv/Fm, Fv′/Fm′ and ФPSII was small, there were significant interactions between tissue culture and family, suggesting that the effect of tissue culture is genotype-specific. Tissue-cultured plantlets were less affected by cold treatment than seedlings, but to a different extent in each family. These interactive effects, however, were comparable to, or much smaller than the single effect of family. These results suggest that tissue culture is a useful method for obtaining genetically homogenous replicates for studying genotype‐environment interaction related to adaptively relevant phenotypes, such as cold tolerance, in non-model outcrossing plants.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1229.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 4)]"

The mercury biomagnificates through the trophic chain and reaches high concentrations in top predators. The present study summarized the information about mercury levels in billfishes available in the literature, with emphasis on swordfish and blue marlin and made an analysis of data from several studies using the multivariate technique Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster (AHC).

However, there is neuronal evidence for robust and rapid differentiation of objects based on their reward history in primates (Hikosaka et al., 2014). We hypothesized that such robust coding should support efficient search for high-value objects, similar to a pop-out mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we let subjects (n=4, macaque monkeys) view a large number of complex objects with consistently biased rewards with variable training durations (1, 5 or >30days). Following training, subjects searched for a high-value object (Good) among a variable number of low-value objects (Bad). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that Good objects were accurately and quickly targeted, often by a single and direct saccade with a very short latency (<200ms). The dependence of search times on display size reduced significantly with longer reward training, giving rise to a more efficient search (40ms/item to 16ms/item). This object-finding skill showed a large capacity for value-biased objects and was maintained in the long-term memory with no interference from reward learning with other objects. Such object-finding skill, particularly its large capacity and its long term retention, would be crucial for maximizing rewards and biological fitness throughout life where many objects are experienced continuously and/or intermittently.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Vision/Journal of Vision1.pdf,"[( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

In allopolyploids, genes derived from one progenitor species are often expressed at higher levels than those from the other progenitor. It has been suggested that this could be due to differences in transposable element (TE) content among progenitors, as silencing of TEs can affect expression of nearby genes. Here, we examine the role of TEs for expression biases in the widespread allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris and in diploid F1 hybrids generated by crossing Capsella orientalis and Capsella rubella, two close relatives of the progenitors of C. bursa-pastoris. As C. rubella harbors more TEs than C. orientalis, we expect C. orientalis alleles to be expressed at higher levels if TE content is key for expression biases. To test this hypothesis, we quantified expression biases at approximately 5800 genes in flower buds and leaves, while correcting for read mapping biases using genomic data. While three of four C. bursa-pastoris accessions exhibited a shift toward higher relative expression of C. orientalis alleles, the fourth C. bursa-pastoris accession had the opposite direction of expression bias, as did diploid F1 hybrids. Associations between TE polymorphism and expression bias were weak, and the effect of TEs on expression bias was small. These results suggest that differences in TE content alone cannot fully explain expression biases in these species. Future studies should investigate the role of differences in TE silencing efficacy, as well as a broader set of other factors.

Ovarian cancer exemplifies limitations of current systems and potential benefits of increased gene testing. Approximately 15% of ovarian cancer patients have a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (″BRCA″) and this has substantial implications for their personal management and that of their relatives. However, in most countries implementation of BRCA testing in ovarian cancer has been inconsistent and largely unsuccessful.

Methods: We developed a mainstream pathway in which BRCA testing was undertaken by cancer team members after 30 minutes online training. Patients with a mutation were sent a genetic appointment with their results. Cascade testing to relatives was performed via standard clinical genetic procedures.

Findings: 207 women with ovarian cancer were offered gene testing through the mainstream pathway and all accepted. 33 (16%) had a BRCA mutation. The result informed management of 79% (121/154) women with active disease including 97% (32/33) women with a mutation. All mutation-positive women and ~3.5 relatives per family have been seen in genetics. Patient and clinician feedback was very positive. >95% found the pathway to be simple and effective. The pathway offers considerable reduction in time (~4-fold) and resource requirements (~13-fold) compared to the traditional genetic pathway. We estimate it would deliver GBP 2.6M NHS cost savings per year, and would allow implementation of national testing recommendations with existing infrastructure.

Currently, two packaging systems based on the DH(26S)5'SIN and the DH-BB(tRNA;TE12) Defective Helper (DH) RNAs are available for making recombinant Sindbis virus that is neurotropic (able to infect neurons and potentially other cells). Both systems produce a fraction of viral particles that can propagate beyond the primary infected neuron. When injected into mouse brains, viruses produced using these DH RNAs label neurons at the injection site, but also elsewhere in the brain. Such ectopic labeling caused recombinant Sindbis viruses to be classified as anterograde viruses with limited retrograde spread, and can complicate the interpretation of neuroanatomical and other experiments.
Here we describe a new DH RNA, DH-BB(5'SIN;TE12ORF), that can be used to produce virus that is both neurotropic and propagation-incompetent. We show in mice that DH-BB(5'SIN;TE12ORF)-packaged virus eliminates infection of cells outside the injection site. We also provide evidence that ectopically labeled cells observed in previous experiments with recombinant Sindbis virus resulted from secondary infection by propagation-competent virus, rather than from inefficient retrograde spread.

Recent studies found that heteroplasmies are highly tissue-specific, site-specific, and allele-specific, however the functional implications have not been explored. This study investigates variation in mtDNA copy numbers (mtCN) in 12 different tissues obtained at autopsy from 152 individuals (ranging in age from 3 days to 96 years). Three different methods to estimate mtCN were compared: shotgun sequencing (in 4 tissues), capture-enriched sequencing (in 12 tissues) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, in 2 tissues). The highest precision in mtCN estimation was achieved using shotgun sequencing data. However, capture-enrichment data provide reliable estimates of relative (albeit not absolute) mtCNs. Comparisons of mtCN from different tissues of the same individual revealed that mtCNs in different tissues are, with few exceptions, uncorrelated. Hence, each tissue of an individual seems to regulate mtCN in a tissue-related rather than an individual-dependent manner. Skeletal muscle (SM) samples showed an age-related decrease in mtCN that was especially pronounced in males, while there was an age-related increase in mtCN for liver (LIV) samples. MtCN in SM samples was significantly negatively correlated with both the total number of heteroplasmic sites and with minor allele frequency (MAF) at two heteroplasmic sites, 408 and 16327. Heteroplasmies at both sites are highly specific for SM, accumulate with aging and are part of functional elements that regulate mtDNA replication. These data support the hypothesis that selection acting on these heteroplasmic sites is reducing mtCN in SM of older individuals.

We present a fast, novel method for identifying and omitting such redundant operations in phylogenetic likelihood calculations, and assess the performance improvement and memory saving attained by our method. Using empirical and simulated data sets, we show that a prototype implementation of our method yields up to 10-fold speedups and uses up to 78% less memory than one of the fastest and most highly tuned implementations of the phylogenetic likelihood function currently available.

Still, there are recurrent patterns in nature, suggesting broad generalizations and understanding of phenomena. The problem is that many generalizations in biology, especially in the form of correlations, might be decoupled from causality, weakening their power of explanation. Here, I bring an example on the Species-Area Relationship (SAR). The SAR is a well-known generalization in biology. The recurrent pattern states a positive relationship between area size and species richness. Understanding the mechanisms why there is a correlation between area and diversity remains a major challenge. I suggest an explicitly focus on mechanistic explanations for the SAR. I propose to use the integration, comparison and interpretation of other (associated or secondary) natural patterns in the searching for causal explanations. Area per se might not account for causality in species diversification or absolute species richness in larger regions. Biotic and abiotic factors of a given area might be studied in order to discover the causal underpinnings of the SAR.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1234.pdf,"[( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 16 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

How a population of genetically identical cells maintains size homeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing fundamental problem. We model size using a stochastic hybrid system, where a cell grows exponentially over time and probabilistic division events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever these events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We first consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures the time since the last division event regulates cellular growth and the rate of cell division. Analysis reveals that such a timer-driven system cannot achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for controlling size we consider three different classes of models: i) a size-dependent growth rate and timer-dependent division rate; ii) a constant growth rate and size-dependent division rate and iii) a constant growth rate and division rate that depends both on the cell size and timer. We show that each of these strategies can potentially achieve bounded intercellular size variation, and derive closed-form expressions for this variation in terms of underlying model parameters. Finally, we discuss how different organisms have adopted the above strategies for maintaining cell size homeostasis.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1235.pdf,"[( 16 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

UNAIDS has set forth an ambitious 90-90-90 strategy for 2020. Separately, it has been shown theoretically and empirically that HIV virulence can evolve over time. Observed virulence levels may reflect an adaptive balance between infected lifespan and per-contact transmission rate. Critically, the potential effects of widespread ART usage on HIV virulence are unknown. To predict these effects, we used an agent-based stochastic model to simulate changes in HIV virulence, using set point viral load as a virulence proxy. We calibrated our epidemic model to the prevalence and incidence trends of South Africa. We also repeated our analysis using a separate model calibration, as a sensitivity analysis, and found that predicted impact of ART on virulence was relatively insensitive to calibration. We explored two distinct ART scenarios, at increasing coverage levels: ART initiation based on patients reaching a CD4+ T cell count threshold, or based on time elapsed since infection (a scenario that mimics the ""universal testing and treatment"" aspirations in the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets). We found that HIV virulence is generally unchanged in scenarios of CD4-based initiation. However, with ART initiation based on time since infection (universal test and treat), virulence can increase moderately within several years of ART rollout, under high coverage levels and early treatment initiation albeit within the context of epidemics that are rapidly decreasing in size. We also show that, compared to non-evolutionary HIV epidemic models, allowing for evolving virulence predicts greater declines in HIV incidence after ART rollout. Our modeling study suggests that increasing virulence driven by universal test and treat is likely not a major public health concern, but could be monitored in sentinel surveillance, in a manner similar to transmitted drug resistance.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Virus Evolution/Virus Evolution3.pdf,"[( 02 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 03 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 21 Feb 2016 , 9), ( 04 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 22 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

difference led us to propose analyses by paired parametric and non-parametric methods to the same data could be used as a diagnostic for epistatic genetic architectures in typical plant breeding populations. The suggested computational diagnostic was based on evaluation of 14 genomic prediction methods applied to eight sets of simulated conditions consisting of three factors, each with two levels. Because the potential set of factors that might affect accuracies of genomic predictions is unknown, there is a need for a systematic approach to identify combinations of factors that impact estimates of accuracy. Herein we propose the application of response surface methods to systematically identify conditions that maximize the difference
between estimated accuracies of genomic prediction methods. The results indicate that genetic architecture and repeatability at their upper boundaries for complete epistasis and repeatability have the greatest influence

Structure analyses and simulations show that interspecific gene flow in each population pair is very low. A single locus, annotated as E3 ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme involved in plant innate immunity, shows a pattern of non-random segregation across populations of both species. A metagenomic analysis revealed information about contaminant exogenous DNA present in RAD sequencing libraries obtained from leaf material. Results of this analysis show clearly divergent bacterial and fungal phyllosphere communities between the species, but consistent communities across populations within each species. A similar set of biotic interactions is involved, together with abiotic factors, in shaping common selective regimes at different growing sites of each species.

They can be produced at biosafety level 2 in the lab using protocols that have evolved considerably over the last 15 to 20 years. Applied by an intracameral bolus, vectors follow conventional as well as uveoscleral outflow pathways. They may affect other structures in the anterior chamber depending on their transduction kinetics which can vary among species when using the same vector.

Nonviral methods of gene transfer are termed transfection with few restrictions of transgene size and type but often a much less efficient gene transfer that is also short-lived. Traditional gene transfer delivers exons while some vectors (lentiviral, herpes and adenoviral) allow transfer of entire genes that include introns. Recent insights have highlighted the role of non-coding RNA, most prominently, siRNA, miRNA and lncRNA. SiRNA is highly specific, miRNA is less specific, while lncRNA uses highly complex mechanisms that involve secondary structures and intergenic, intronic, overlapping, antisense, and bidirectional location. Several promising preclinical studies have targeted the RhoA or the prostaglandin pathway or modified the extracellular matrix. TGF-β and glaucoma myocilin mutants have been transduced to elevate the intraocular pressure in glaucoma models. Cell based therapies have started to show first promise. Past approaches have focused on the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm′s canal while new strategies are concerned with modification of outflow tract elements that are downstream of the trabecular meshwork.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1243.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 12)]"

Methods: Gonioscopic, plasma-mediated ab interno trabeculectomy (AIT; Trabectome, Neomedix, Tustin, CA) was established in enucleated pig eyes. We developed a program to automatically quantify outflow changes (R, package eye-canalogram, github.com) using a fluorescent tracer reperfusion technique. Trabecular meshwork (TM) ablation was demonstrated with fluorescent spheres in 6 eyes before formal outflow quantification with two dye reperfusion canalograms in 6 further eyes. Eyes were perfused with a central, intracameral needle at 15 mmHg. Canalograms and histology were correlated for each eye. 
Results: The pig eye provided a model with high similarity to AIT in human patients. Histology indicated ablation of TM and unroofing of most Schlemms canal segments. Spheres highlighted additional circumferential and radial outflow beyond the immediate area of ablation. Differential canalograms showed that AIT caused an increase of outflow of 17+/-5 fold inferonasally (IN), 14+/-3 fold superonasally (SN) and also an increase in the opposite quadrants with a 2+/-1 fold increase superotemporally (ST) and 3+/-3 inferotemporally (IT). Perilimbal specific flow image analysis showed an accelerated nasal filling with an additional perilimbal flow direction into adjacent quadrants.

Four low- and four high-elevation populations were repeatedly exposed to high temperature (45oC) in a growth chamber at bolting stage. High temperature induced 23% more inflorescence branches, 25% longer total reproductive branch length, and 12% less root dry mass, compared with control. However summed fruit length, hence fitness, decreased by 15%, populations did not differ significantly in fitness reduction. High elevation populations showed more avoidance, i.e. lower rosette temperature at 45oC. Low elevation populations showed more tolerance, maintaining relatively higher photosynthetic rate at 45oC. Avoidance was associated with high transpiration rate and flat rosette leaf angle. Tolerance was negatively associated with heat shock protein 101 (Hsp101) and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation.

Neutral theory, built around the hypothesis that individual performance is independent of group membership, has found utility across the disciplines of ecology, population genetics, and economics, both because of the success of the neutral hypothesis in predicting system properties and because deviations from these predictions provide information about the underlying dynamics. However, most tests of neutrality are weak, based on static system properties such as species-abundance distributions or the number of singletons in a sample. Time-series data provide a window onto a system's dynamics, and should furnish tests of the neutral hypothesis that are more powerful to detect deviations from neutrality and more informative about to the type of competitive asymmetry that drives the deviation. 

Here, we present a neutrality test for time-series data. We apply this test to several microbial time-series and financial time-series and find that most of these systems are not neutral. Our test isolates the covariance structure of neutral competition, thus facilitating further exploration of the nature of asymmetry in the covariance structure of competitive systems. Much like neutrality tests from population genetics that use relative abundance distributions have enabled researchers to scan entire genomes for genes under selection, we anticipate our time-series test will be useful for quick significance tests of neutrality across a range of ecological, economic, and sociological systems for which time-series data are available.

This variation is an adaptive response to local climates and is controlled by gene sequence variation and especially by variation in expression at the transcriptome level. Plants from contrasting climates are thus expected to have different patterns in gene expression. Acclimation, a pre-exposure to sub-lethal temperature before exposing to extreme high temperature, is an important adaptive mechanism of plant survival. We are interested to evaluate the gene expression difference to heat stress for plants from contrasting climates and the role of acclimation in altering their gene expression pattern. Natural Arabidopsis thaliana plants from low elevation mediterranean and high elevation montane climates were exposed to two heat treatments at the bolting stage: a) 45 oC: a direct exposure to 45oC heat; b) 38/45 oC: an exposure to 45oC heat after a 38oC acclimation treatment. Variation in overall gene expression patterns was investigated. We also explored gene expression patterns for Hsp/Hsf pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. In both heat treatments, high elevation plants had more differentially expressed (DE) genes than low elevation plants. In 45 oC, only Hsp/Hsf pathway was activated in low elevation plants; both Hsp/Hsf and ROS pathways were activated in high elevation plants. Small Hsps had the highest magnitude of change in low elevation plants while Hsp70 and Hsp90 showed the largest magnitude of fold in high elevation plants. In 38/45 oC, Hsp/Hsf and ROS pathways were activated in both low and high elevation plants. Low elevation plants showed up-regulation in all Hsps, especially small Hsps; high elevation plants showed down-regulation in all Hsps.  Low elevation and high elevation also adopted different genes in the ROS pathway. We also observed genes that shifted expression in both low and high elevation plants but with opposite directions of change. This study indicates that low and high elevation plants have evolved adaptive divergence in heat stress response. The contrasting patterns of temperature variation in low and high elevation sites appears to have played a strong role in the evolution of divergent patterns to high temperature stress, both pre-acclimation and direct exposure gene expression responses.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1245.pdf,"[( 18 Mar 2016 , 5)]"

Tetrahymena null mutants with an insertion of a neo gene cassette into the IFT52 gene undergo frequent suppressions that lead to conditional assembly of cilia only under hypoxic conditions (Brown et al. 2003). Here we show that these conditional suppressions are intragenic and occur by a novel mechanism. First, the non-native (bacterial) portion of the DNA sequence of the neo cassette is deleted during the process of genome rearrangement that occurs in the developing macronucleus of conjugating Tetrahymena. Next, the residual sequences of the neo cassette  (of Tetrahymena origin) within the IFT52 mRNA are recognized as multiple introns and undergo splicing, leading to a restoration of the translational frame of IFT52. The resulting hypoxia-dependent IFT52 protein contains an insertion of 43 new amino acids that replace 7 original amino acids. Taken together with a study in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showing a hypoxia-dependence of another IFT subunit mutant, IFT46, (Hou et al. 2007), our observations generalize that defective IFT complex subunits can regain functionality under hypoxia.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1246.pdf,"[( 18 Mar 2016 , 4)]"

Furthermore, the paucity of information on growth, mortality, and fishing effort for devil rays make quantifying population growth rates and extinction risk challenging. Here, we use a published size-at-age dataset for a large-bodied devil ray species, the Spinetail Devil Ray (Mobula japanica), to estimate somatic growth rates, age at maturity, maximum age and natural and fishing mortality. From these estimates, we go on to calculate a plausible distribution of the maximum intrinsic population growth rate (rmax) and place the productivity of this large devil ray in context by comparing it to 95 other chondrichthyan species. We find evidence that larger devil rays have low somatic growth rate, low annual reproductive output, and low maximum population growth rates, suggesting they have low productivity. Devil ray maximum intrinsic population growth rate rmax is very similar to that of manta rays, indicating devil rays can potentially be driven to local extinction at low levels of fishing mortality. We show that fishing rates of a small-scale artisanal Mexican fishery were up to three times greater than the natural mortality rate, and twice as high as our estimate of rmax, and therefore unsustainable.

We manipulated line drawings of real-world environments such that statistics of contour orientations or junctions were disrupted. Manipulated and intact line drawings were presented to participants in an fMRI experiment. Scene categories were decoded from neural activity patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA) and other visual brain regions. Disruption of junctions but not orientations led to a drastic decrease in decoding accuracy in the PPA and OPA, indicating the reliance of these areas on intact junction statistics. Accuracy of decoding from early visual cortex, on the other hand, was unaffected by either image manipulation. We further show that the correlation of error patterns between decoding from the scene-selective brain areas and behavioral experiments is contingent on intact contour junctions.

Multitude of theoretical and computational models have addressed this issue, especially focusing on the nature of the transitions governing tumor clearance as some relevant model parameters are tuned. In this contribution, we analyze a mathematical model of unstable tumor progression using the quasispecies framework. Our aim is to define a minimal model incorporating the dynamics of competition between healthy cells and a heterogeneous population of cancer cell phenotypes involving changes in replication-related genes (i.e., proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes), in genes responsible for genomic stability, and in house-keeping genes. Such mutations or loss of genes result into different phenotypes with increased proliferation rates and/or increased genomic instabilities. Also, lethal phenotypes with mutations or loss of house-keeping genes are present in our model.

Results: Despite bifurcations in the classical deterministic quasispecies model are typically given by smooth, continuous shifts (i.e., transcritical bifurcations), we here identify an novel type of abrupt transition causing tumor extinction. Such a bifurcation, named as trans-heteroclinic, is characterized by the exchange of stability between two distant fixed points (that do not collide) involving, respectively, tumor persistence and tumor clearance. The increase of mutation and/or the decrease of the replication rate of tumor cells involves this catastrophic shift of tumor cell populations. The transient times near bifurcation thresholds are also characterized, showing a power law dependence of exponent −1 of the transients as mutation is changed near the bifurcation value.

Conclusions: An abrupt transition involving tumor clearance has been identified with a phenotypic quasispecies cancer model. This result is discussed in the context of targeted cancer therapy as a possible therapeutic strategy to force a catastrophic shift by delivering mutagenic and cytotoxic drugs inside tumor cells. Our model also reveals a novel mechanism causing a discontinuous transition given by the stability exchange of two distant fixed points, which we name as a trans-heteroclinic bifurcation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Mathematical Biology/Journal of Mathematical Biology4.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 21 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 19 Mar 2016 , 10), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 5)]"

Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random fields, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artificial data sets and compare it to state-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.We show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the underlying model when they are known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both biological and artificial data.

The underlying strategies used by influenza A viruses (IAVs) to adapt to new hosts while crossing the species barrier are complex and yet to be understood completely. Several studies have been published identifying singular genomic signatures that indicate such a host switch. The complexity of the problem suggested that in addition to the singular signatures, there might be a combinatorial use of such genomic features, in nature, defining adaptation to hosts.. 
Results
We used computational rule-based modeling to identify combinatorial sets of interacting amino acid (aa) residues in 12 proteins of IAVs of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. We built highly accurate rule-based models for each protein that could differentiate between viral aa sequences coming from avian and human hosts, . We found 68 combinations of aa residues associated to host adaptation (HAd) on HA, M1, M2, NP, NS1, NEP, PA, PA-X, PB1 and PB2 proteins of the H1N1 subtype and 24 on M1, M2, NEP, PB1 and PB2 proteins of the H3N2 subtypes. In addition to these combinations, we found 132 novel singular aa signatures distributed among all proteins, including the newly discovered PA-X protein, of both subtypes. We showed that HA, NA, NP, NS1, NEP, PA-X and PA proteins of the H1N1 subtype carry H1N1-specific and HA, NA, PA-X, PA, PB1-F2 and PB1 of the H3N2 subtype carry H3N2-specific HAd signatures. M1, M2, PB1-F2, PB1 and PB2 of H1N1 subtype, in addition to H1N1 signatures, also carry H3N2 signatures. Similarly M1, M2, NP, NS1, NEP and PB2 of H3N2 subtype were shown to carry both H3N2 and H1N1 HAd signatures.
Conclusions
To sum it up, we computationally constructed simple IF-THEN rule-based models that could distinguish between aa sequences of virus particles originating from avian and human hosts. From the rules we identified combinations of aa residues as signatures facilitating the adaptation to specific hosts. The identification of combinatorial aa signatures suggests that the process of adaptation of IAVs to a new host is more complex than previously suggested. The present study provides a basis for further detailed studies with the aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms providing the foundation for the adaptation process.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1253.pdf,"[( 20 Mar 2016 , 4), ( 21 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

We detected amino acid motifs predicted to be B cell epitopes in Zika virus proteins which are also present in human proteins, including pro-neuropeptide Y (proNPY), NAV2 and other proteins with interacting neurophysiologic function. We examine the predicted MHC binding of peptides likely to provide T cell help to the potential mimic epitopes. Some potential mimic epitopes in Zika virus envelope have apparently strong T cell help, likely facilitating immunoglobulin class switch. We also identify epitope mimic commonalities with dengue serotypes 1 and 3.

It is estimated that it infects 40% of insect species, so epidemiologically it may be considered a pandemic species. However, the mechanisms by which it is acquired from other species (horizontal transmission) or by which it coevolves with its hosts as a result of vertical transmission across generations are not known in detail. In fact, there are few systems in which the codivergence between host and bacterium has been described.
This study goes in deep in the Wolbachia infection in the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus. This well-known system allows us to investigate the mechanism of acquisition of various Wolbachia strains in a new host, and the bacterial genomic changes during bacterial-host codivergence: We describe the genetic diversity of Wolbachia strains infecting both subspecies of C. parallelus and analyse their phylogenetic relationship. We also show the emergence of new bacterial alleles resulting from recombination events in Wolbachia infecting hybrid hosts. Our data suggest that F strains detected in this grasshopper have co-diverged with its host, versus a more recent horizontal transmission of B strains. According with this, we discuss the potential role of Wolbachia in the dynamics of the grasshopper hybrid zone and in the divergence of the two grasshopper subspecies since the origin of their hybrid zone.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1255.pdf,"[( 20 Mar 2016 , 11), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

Complete EMT, however, is not required for metastasis: circulating tumor cells exhibit hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal states, and genetic perturbations promoting partial EMT induce metastasis in vivo. An open question is whether and to what extent intermediate stages of EMT promote invasiveness. Here, we investigate this question, building on recent observation of a new invasive property. Migrating cancer cell lines and cells transduced with prometastatic genes slide around other cells on spatially-confined, fiber-like micropatterns. We show here that low-dosage/short-duration exposure to TGFβ induces partial EMT and enables sliding on narrower (26 μm) micropatterns than untreated counterparts (41 μm). High-dosage/long-duration exposure induces more complete EMT, including disrupted cell-cell contacts and reduced E-cadherin expression, and promotes sliding on the narrowest (15 μm) micropatterns. These results demonstrate that EMT is a potent inducer of cell sliding, even under significant spatial constraints, and EMT-mediated invasive sliding is progressive, with partial EMT promoting intermediate sliding behavior. Our findings suggest a model in which fiber maturation and partial EMT work synergistically to promote invasiveness during cancer progression.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biophysical Journal/Biophysical Journal8.pdf,"[( 20 Mar 2016 , 4), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 2)]"
