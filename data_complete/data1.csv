"November 14, 2013",The evolution of sex differences in disease genetics,Trends in Genetics,"[(Gilks, William P,  University of Sussex), (Abbott, Jessica K,  Lund University), (Morrow, Edward H,  University of Sussex)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/000414 ,"There are significant differences in the biology of males and females, ranging from biochemical pathways to behavioural responses, which are relevant to modern medicine. Broad-sense heritability estimates differ between the sexes for many common medical disorders, indicating that genetic architecture can be sex-dependent. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified sex-specific and sex-biased effects, where in addition to sex-specific effects on gene expression, twenty-two medical traits have sex-specific or sex-biased loci. Sex-specific genetic architecture of complex traits is also extensively documented in model organisms using genome-wide linkage or association mapping, and in gene disruption studies. The evolutionary origins of sex-specific genetic architecture and sexual dimorphism lie in the fact that males and females share most of their genetic variation yet experience different selection pressures. At the extreme is sexual antagonism, where selection on an allele acts in opposite directions between the sexes. Sexual antagonism has been repeatedly identified via a number of experimental methods in a range of different taxa. Although the molecular basis remains to be identified, mathematical models predict the maintenance of deleterious variants that experience selection in a sex-dependent manner. There are multiple mechanisms by which sexual antagonism and alleles under sex-differential selection could contribute toward the genetics of common, complex disorders. The evidence we review clearly indicates that further research into sex-dependent selection and the sex-specific genetic architecture of diseases would be rewarding. This would be aided by studies of laboratory and wild animal populations, and by modelling sex-specific effects in genome-wide association data with joint, gene-by-sex interaction tests. We predict that even sexually monomorphic diseases may harbour cryptic sex-specific genetic architecture. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that investigating sex-dependent epistasis may be especially rewarding. Finally, the prevalent nature of sex-specific genetic architecture in disease offers scope for the development of more effective, sex-specific therapies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Trends in Genetics/Trends in Genetics1.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2013 , 2)]"

However, basic principles of biodiversity sampling have been overlooked for many years. In this paper, I proposed and explored five principles of sampling for a specific area and biodiversity study. The first principle of sampling, species increasing with area, is that the number of species increases with the area. The second principle of sampling, individuals increasing with area, is that the number of individuals increases with the area. The third principle of sampling, sum of species number, is that the sum of species number in one area and species number in another area is no less than the total species number in the two areas. The fourth principle of sampling, individual complement, is that the sum of the mathematical expectation of individual number of one or several species in the area a and that of the same one or several species in the area A-a is the total individual number N of the same one or several species in the total area A. The fifth principle of sampling, species-area theory, is that the sum of the mathematical expectation of number of species in the area a and that of number of species lost if area A-a is cleared is the total species number M in the total area A.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2013 , 3)]"

Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on colour pattern. The co-mimetic species H. erato and H. melpomene have parallel hybrid zones where both species undergo a change from one colour pattern form to another. We use restriction associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome wide sequence markers and use these to analyse patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data; alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly, and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ~15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the colour pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to colour pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped colour pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus.

Public genomic data allow comparative analyses, testing of new tools and genotype-phenotype association studies. Personal genomics data of unrelated individuals are available in the public domain, notably the Personal Genome Project; however, to date genomics family data and metadata are severely lacking, mainly due to cost, privacy concerns or restricted access to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Family data have a lot to offer as they allow the study of heritability, something which is impossible to do just by using unrelated individuals. 
FINDINGS: A whole family from Southern Spain decided to genotype, sequence and analyse their personal genomes making them publicly available under a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0; commonly denominated as public domain). These data include a) five 23andMe SNP chip genotype bed files, b) four raw exomes with their assorted bam files and VCF files, c) a metagenomic raw sequencing data file and d) derived data of likely phenotypes using SNPedia-derived tools. 
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first CC0 released set of genomic, phenotypic and metagenomic data for a whole family. This dataset is also unique in that it was obtained through direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Hence any ordinary citizen with enough budget and samples should be able to reproduce this experiment. We envisage this dataset to be a useful resource for a variety of applications in the personal genomics field as a) negative control data for trait association discovery, b) testing data for development of new software and c) sample data for heritability studies.

density and low density microdomains. Hydrophobic molecules, including proteins,
accumulate selectively into stable populations, enriched in high density water, at
charged sites on biopolymers. In enriched high density water, proteins are probably
partially unfolded and may precipitate out when released. All extracellular matrices
contain such charged polymers. Prions, which have been shown to accumulate in soils
and clays containing silicates and aluminates also probably accumulate in extracellular matrices.

Release of proteins follows hydrolysis of the charged groups by highly reactive high
density water. This is normally a slow process but is greatly accelerated by urea.
Plaques may form with age and disease because of accumulation of urea and, perhaps,
glucose in the blood. This favours precipitation of proteins emerging from matrices,rather than refolding and solution.

Notably, very little is known about the genetic and physiological features underlying the female response to sexual selection pressures. By combining an experimental evolution approach with genomic techniques, we investigated the effects of single and multiple matings on female fecundity and gene expression. We experimentally manipulated the mating system in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster by removing sexual selection, with the aim of testing differences in short term post-mating effects of females evolved under different mating strategies. We show that monogamous females suffer decreased fecundity, a decrease that was partially recovered by experimentally reversing the selection pressure back to the ancestral promiscuous state. The post-mating gene expression profiles of monogamous females differ significantly from promiscuous females, involving 9% of the genes tested. These transcripts are active in several tissues, mainly ovaries, neural tissues and midgut, and are involved in metabolic processes, reproduction and signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate how the female post-mating response can evolve under different mating systems, and provide novel insights into the genes targeted by sexual selection in females, by identifying a list of candidate genes responsible for the decrease in female fecundity in the absence of promiscuity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print4.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2013 , 2), ( 14 Nov 2013 , 1)]"

To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5°C and 32.5°C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes 33 hours at 17.5°C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5°C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5°C and have drastically slowed development by 30°C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30°C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5°C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all of the species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection in response to the thermal environment in which each species lives.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics1.pdf,[]

The set of functional predictors we examined includes measures that have been demonstrated to correlate with the association status of SNPs in the GC and some whose utility in this regard is speculative: summaries of the UCSC Human Genome

Endocannabinoids are present in lipoproteins of both flies and humans, and repress the pathway in both mammalian signaling assays and Drosophila wing imaginal discs. In Drosophila, endocannabinoids are required in vivo to keep the levels of Smoothened and full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci155) low in the absence of Hedgehog. Furthermore, elevating their endogenous levels inhibits Hedgehog-dependent accumulation of Smoothened and Ci155.

Previous methods for finding these parameters rely on the dynamic behaviour of the system.
This means that the methods are time-sensitive and often rely on non-linear curve fitting.

In the same manner as previous techniques, we consider the concentrations of chemicals in a reaction.
However, we investigate the static behaviour of the reaction at dynamic equilibrium, or steady state.
Here too, the chemical concentrations depend on the kinetic parameters of the reaction.
In an open reaction, the static concentrations also depends on the rate of input of the source of reacting chemical.
Controlling this input rate slides the steady state along a curve in concentration space.
This curve is determined by the kinetic parameters.
The plane of this curve is sufficient to find the kinetic parameters.

The new method we propose uses only the steady state concentration values to determine the kinetic parameters of the reaction.
These values are constant once dynamic equilibrium is achieved, and so can be read accurately.
Readings can be repeated readily to reduce error.

A promising assay depends on RNASeq approaches, which builds on next generation sequencing pipelines capable of interrogating cDNAs extracted from a cell. The underlying pipeline starts with base-calling, collect the sequence reads and interpret the raw-read in terms of transcripts that are grouped with respect to different splice-variant isoforms of a messenger RNA. We address a very basic problem involved in all of these pipeline, namely accurate Bayesian base-calling, which could combine the analog intensity data with suitable underlying priors on base-composition in the transcripts. In the context of sequencing genomic DNA, a powerful approach for base-calling has been developed in the TotalReCaller pipeline. For these purposes, it uses a suitable reference whole-genome sequence in a compressed self-indexed format to derive its priors. However, TotalReCaller faces many new challenges in the transcriptomic domain, especially since we still lack a fully annotated library of all possible transcripts, and hence a sufficiently good prior. There are many possible solutions, similar to the ones developed for TotalReCaller, in applications addressing de novo sequencing and assembly, where partial contigs or string-graphs could be used to boot-strap the Bayesian priors on base-composition. A similar approach would be applicable here too, partial assembly of transcripts can be used to characterize the splicing junctions or organize them in incom- patibility graphs and then used as priors for TotalReCaller. The key algorithmic techniques for this purpose have been addressed in a forthcoming paper on Stringomics. Here, we address a related but fundamental problem, by assuming that we only have a reference genome, with certain intervals marked as candidate regions for ORF (Open Reading Frames), but not necessarily complete annotations regarding the 5 or 3 termini of a gene or its exon-intron structure.

Such traits measure molecular functions and, from an evolutionary point of view, are important as targets of natural selection.

We focus on universal evolutionary characteristics: these are largely independent of a trait's genetic basis, which is often at least partially unknown. We show that universal measurements can be used to infer selection on a quantitative trait, which determines its evolutionary mode of conservation or adaptation. Furthermore, universality is closely linked to predictability of trait evolution across lineages. We argue that universal trait statistics extends over a range of cellular scales and opens new avenues of quantitative evolutionary systems biology.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Current Opinion in Genetics & Development/Current Opinion in Genetics & Development1.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2013 , 2)]"

As we know, this is the first reported case of human infection by the H6N1 virus, because this subtype virus usually circulates in birds and poultry. Therefore it is crucial to know how this virus attained the ability to infect humans. Using phylogenetic analysis, we found that this virus was derived from reassortments of multiple lineages of H6N1 viruses and H5N2 viruses. The results deepen our understanding of how the new human-infecting virus originated and based on these we discussed possible explanations for the H6N1 infection of humans. Our results, together with recent studies of H7N9 viruses which result in severe disorders, suggest that reassortments among avian-type viruses are quite often, which may sometimes result in fatal infections in humans. Thus a close watch on the circulation of avian influenza viruses is pretty necessary.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print10.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2013 , 2)]"

In contrast, statin based drugs, which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this pathway, target a single enzyme. Here, we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of the pathway. We employ a modest set of assumptions: that the pathway operates away from saturation, that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus infection or treated with IFNγ, we show that, under these assumptions, coordinate down regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In contrast, modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol production, we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of specificity, altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the pathway, than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. Finally, the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target effects, suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biochimie/Biochimie1.pdf,[]

Using confocal microscopy, we show that endogenous PTP1B actually exhibits a higher local concentration at the mitochondria in all mammalian cell lines that we tested. Fluorescently labeled chimeras containing full-length PTP1B or only its 35 amino acid tail anchor localized identically, demonstrating the complete dependence of PTP1Bs subcellular partitioning on its tail anchor. Correlative light and electron microscopy using GFP- driven photo-oxidation of DAB revealed that PTP1Bs tail anchor localizes it to the mitochondrial interior and to mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) sites along the ER. Heterologous expression of the tail anchor of PTP1B in the yeast S. cerevisiae surprisingly led to its exclusive localization to the ER/vacuole with no presence at the mitochondria. Studies with various yeast mutants of conserved membrane insertion pathways revealed a role for the GET/TRC40 pathway in ER insertion, but also emphasized the likely dominant role of spontaneous insertion. Further studies of modified tail isoforms in both yeast and mammalian cells revealed a remarkable sensitivity of subcellular partitioning to slight changes in transmembrane domain (TMD) length, C-terminal charge, and hydropathy. For example, addition of a single positive charge to the tail anchor was sufficient to completely shift the tail anchor to the mitochondria in mammalian cells and to largely shift it there in yeast cells, and a point mutation that increased TMD hydropathy was sufficient to localize the tail anchor exclusively to the ER in mammalian cells. Striking differences in the subcellular partitioning of a given tail anchor isoform in mammalian versus yeast cells most likely point to fundamental differences in the lipid composition of specific organelles (e.g. affecting membrane charge or thickness) in higher versus lower eukaryotes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) detection of the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based interaction of the catalytic domain of PTP1B with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) at the mitochondria revealed a strong interaction on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), suggesting the presence of a significant pool of PTP1B there and a novel role for PTP1B in the regulation of mitochondrial ErbB1 activity. In summary, in addition to its well-established general localization along the ER, our results reveal that PTP1B specifically accumulates at MAM sites along the ER and localizes as well to the OMM and mitochondrial matrix. Further elucidation of PTP1Bs roles in these different locations (including the identification of its targets) will likely be critical for understanding its complex regulation of general cellular responses, cell proliferation, and diseased states.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print14.pdf,[]

The challenges and scope of theoretical biology. J. Theoret. Biol. 276: 269-276). The simplest kinds of complex biological matter are bacterial cells; they appear complexfrom a physicochemical standpointbecause they are multicomponent, multiphase, biomacromolecularly crowded, and re emergent; the property of re-emergence differentiates biological matter from complex chemical and physical matter.
Bacterial cells cannot self-reassemble spontaneously from their biomolecules and biomacromolecules (via non-covalent molecular forces) without the action of external drivers; on Earth, such drivers have been diurnal (cycling) physicochemical gradients, i.e. temperature, water activity, etc. brought about by solar radiation striking the Earths rotating surface. About 3.5 billion years ago, these cycling gradients drove complex chemical prebiotic soups toward progenotic living states from which extant bacteria evolved (Spitzer and Poolman, 2009; The role of biomacromolecular crowding, ionic strength and physicochemical gradients in the complexities of lifes emergence. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Revs. 73:371-388). Thus there is historical non-equilibrium continuity between complex dead chemical matter and complex living states of bacterial cells.  This historical continuity becomes accessible to present-day experimentation, when cycling physicochemical gradients act on dead biomacromolecules obtained from (suitably) killed bacterial populations  on a biotic soup of chemicals (Harold, 2005, Molecules into cells: specifying spatial architecture. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 69:544-564). The making of biotic soups and recovering living states from them is briefly discussed in terms of novel concepts and experimental possibilities.  
In principle, emergent living states contingently arise and evolve when cycling physicochemical gradients continuously act on complex chemical mass; once living states become dynamically stabilized, the inevitable process errors of primitive cell cycles become the roots of Darwinian evolution.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print16.pdf,"[( 25 Nov 2016 , 1)]"

We used the heat ratio method to measure sap flow rates through leaf petioles and leaflet petiolules of saplings of the tropical tree Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) to determine how leaf and leaflet sap flow responds to variation in light and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).  We found that in the morning sap flow rates to east-facing leaves increased 26 minutes before adjacent west-facing leaves.  Although leaves had higher integrated sap flow than their largest leaflet, this difference was not proportional to the difference in leaf area, which could be due to lower conduit area in petiolules than in petioles.  In contrast to measurements on main stems, integrated daily sap flow was negatively correlated with daily mean VPD.  Furthermore, leaves exhibited previously undescribed patterns of hysteresis in the sap flow-VPD and sap flow-PAR relationships.  When hysteresis in the sap flow-PAR relationship was clockwise, the sap flow-VPD relationship was also clockwise; however, when hysteresis in the sap flow-PAR relationship was counterclockwise, the sap flow-VPD relationship displayed an intersected loop.

In this study we assessed telomerase activity and telomeric lncRNA expression in a mouse model of skeletal myogenesis. Using the C2C12 cell line we demonstrated decreased telomerase activity during differentiation into terminally-differentiated skeletal myotubes.

Telomeric transcripts were detected in both myoblasts and myotubes, with reduced expression during differentiation correlating with reduced telomerase expression. Our data indicate that in a mouse model of skeletal myogenesis TERRA expression does not reduce telomerase activity, suggesting that their relationship is more complex than originally perceived; the role of telomeric derived lncRNAs in relation to telomerase activity may be cell-type specific.

However, strong conclusions on the admissible dynamic behaviors of a model can often be achieved without detailed knowledge of its specific parameters. In particular, starting with Thomas' conjectures, loop-based criteria have been largely used to characterize oscillatory and multistationary dynamic outcomes in systems with a sign definite Jacobian.

We build on the rich literature focused on the identification of potential oscillatory and multistationary behaviors based on parameter-free criteria.
We propose a classification for sign-definite non autocatalytic biological networks which summarize several existing results in the literature, adding new results when necessary.  We define candidate oscillators and multistationary systems based on their admissible  transitions to instability.
We introduce four categories: strong/weak candidate oscillatory/multistationary systems, which correspond to networks in which all/some of the existing feedback loops are negative/positive. We provide  necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing strong and  weak candidate oscillators and multistationary systems based on the exclusive or  simultaneous presence of positive and negative loops in their linearized dynamics. We also consider the case in which the overall system is the connection of several stable aggregate monotone components, providing conditions in terms of positive/negative loops in a suitable network with aggregate monotone systems as nodes.

 Most realistic examples of biological networks fall in the gray area of systems in which both positive and negative cycles are present: therefore, both oscillatory and bistable behavior are in principle possible. Native systems with a large number of components are often interconnections of monotone modules, where negative/positive loops among modules characterize oscillatory and bistable behaviors, in agreement with our results.
 Finally, we note that many canonical example circuits exhibiting oscillations or bistability fall in the categories of strong candidate oscillators/multistationary systems.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print19.pdf,[]

According to this hypothesis, the jDNA functions as a defense mechanism against insertion mutagenesis by endogenous and exogenous inserting elements such as retroviruses, thereby protecting informational DNA sequences from inactivation or alteration of their expression. Notably, this model couples the mechanisms and the selective forces responsible for the origin of jDNA with its putative protective biological function, which represents a classic case of fighting fire with fire. One of the key tenets of this theory is that in humans and many other species, jDNAs serves as a protective mechanism against insertional oncogenic transformation.

However, BABA-induced plant resistance to insects is less well-studied, especially its underlying mechanism. In this research, we applied BABA to wheat seedlings and tested its effects on Sitobion avenae. When applied as a soil drench, BABA significantly reduced weight of S. avenae, whereas foliar spray and seed treatment had no such effects. BABA-mediated suppression of S. avenae growth is dose dependent and could last at least for 7 days. The aminobutyric acid concentration in phloem sap of BABA-treated plants accumulated to high levels and increased with BABA concentrations applied. Moreover, after 10 days of treatment, the aminobutyric acid content in BABA-treated plants was still higher than that in control treatment. S. avenae could not discriminate artificial diet containing BABA from standard diet, indicating that BABA itself is not a deterrent to this aphid. Also S. avenae did not show preference for control plants or BABA-treated plants. Consistent with choice test results, S. avenae had similar feeding activities on control and BABA-treated plants, suggesting that BABA did not induce antifeedants in wheat seedlings. In addition, aminobutyric acid concentration in S. avenae feeding on BABA-treated plants was significantly higher than those feeding on control palnts. S. avenae growth rate was reduced on artificial diet containing BABA, indicating direct toxic effects of BABA to this aphid.

The Pacific Biosciences sequencer uses optics to view a polymerase and its interaction with a single DNA molecule in real-time, offering a unique way to detect potential alternative DNA structures.  We have developed a new way to examine polymerase kinetics and relate it to the DNA sequence by using a wavelet transform of read information from the sequencer.  We use this method to examine how  polymerase kinetics are related to nucleotide base composition.  We then examine tandem repeat sequences known for their ability to form different DNA structures: (CGG)n and (CG)n repeats which can, respectively, form G-quadruplex DNA and Z-DNA.  We find pausing around the (CGG)n repeat that may indicate the presence of G-quadruplexes in some of the sequencer reads.  The (CG)n repeat does not appear to cause polymerase pausing, but its kinetics signature nevertheless suggests the possibility that alternative nucleotide conformations may sometimes be present.

Even though some of the essential phenomena that characterize crypt structure and dynamics have been effectively described in the past, the relation between the differentiation process and the overall crypt homeostasis is still partially understood.
We here investigate this relation and other important biological phenomena by introducing a novel multiscale model that combines a morphological description of the crypt with a gene regulation model: the emergent dynamical behavior of the underlying gene regulatory network drives cell growth and differentiation processes, linking the two distinct spatio-temporal levels. 
The model relies on a few a priori assumptions, yet accounting for several key processes related to crypt functioning, such as: dynamic gene activation patterns, stochastic differentiation, signaling pathways ruling cell adhesion properties, cell displacement, cell growth, mitosis, apoptosis and the presence of biological noise. 
We show that this modeling approach captures the major dynamical phenomena that characterize the regular physiology of crypts, such as cell sorting, coordinate migration, dynamic turnover, stem cell niche maintenance and clonal expansion.  All in all, the model suggests that the process of stochastic differentiation might be sufficient to drive the crypt to homeostasis, under certain crypt configurations. Besides, our approach allows to make precise quantitative inferences that, when possible, were matched to the current biological knowledge and it permits to investigate the role of gene-level perturbations, with reference to cancer development. 
We also remark the theoretical framework is general and may applied to different tissues, organs or organisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE4.pdf,"[( 05 Dec 2013 , 1), ( 29 Nov 2013 , 1)]"

In this paper the hypothesis is suggested that a LHON mutation decreases the function of the mitochondrial enzyme, Complex I, by 50% and this alone critically endangers the survival of cells - especially the fragile cells of the optic nerves.

The NFPP was implemented in 17 provinces starting in the year 2000 in response to deforestation-caused flooding. We used MODIS data (MOD13Q1) to estimate forest cover and forest loss across mainland China, and we report that 1.765 million km2 or 18.7% of mainland China was covered in forest (12.3%, canopy cover > 70%) and woodland (6.4%, 40% ≤ canopy cover < 70%) in 2000. By 2010, a total of 480,203 km2 of forest+woodland was lost, amounting to an annual deforestation rate of 2.7%. The forest-only loss was 127,473 km2, or 1.05% annually. The three most rapidly deforested provinces were outside NFPP jurisdiction, in the southeast. Within the NFPP provinces, the annual forest+woodland loss rate was 2.26%, and the forest-only rate was 0.62%. Because these loss rates are likely overestimates, China appears to have achieved, and even exceeded, its NFPP target of reducing deforestation to 1.1% annually in the target provinces. We also assemble the first-ever polygon dataset for Chinas forested NNRs (n=237), which covered 74,030 km2 in 2000.

A main class of intracellular effectors are the CRNs. They are translocated into the host cell and specifically localise to the nucleus where they are thought to perturb many different cellular processes. Although CRN proteins have been implicated as effectors, direct evidence of CRN mediated perturbation of host processes has been lacking. Here we show that a conserved CRN effector from P. capsici directly binds to tomato transcription factor SlTCP14-2. Previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that transcription factor TCP14 may be key immune signalling protein, targeted by effectors from divergent species. We extend on our understanding of TCP targeting by pathogen effectors by showing that the P. capsici effector CRN12_997 binds to SlTCP14-2 in plants. SlTCP14-2 over-expression enhances immunity to P. capsici, a phenotypic outcome that can be abolished by co-expression of CRN12_997. 
We show that in the presence of CRN12_997, SlTCP14-2 association with nuclear chromatin is diminished, resulting in altered SlTCP14 subnuclear localisation. These results suggest that CRN12_997 prevents SlTCP14 from positively regulating defence against P. capsici.  Our work demonstrates a direct interaction between an oomycete CRN and a host target required for suppression of immunity.

This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another player in one-shot interactions has no direct benefit to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The ""norm psychology"" hypothesis holds that a player's choice of strategy is heavily influenced by socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms of their particular society. The ""evolutionary mismatch"" hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter-gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these evolved ""protocols"" for cooperation are misapplied in modern, laboratory, conditions. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well known model of the mismatch hypothesis. I show that the cooperation generated by the model is based on a flawed assumption - that the best thing to do is cooperate in a repeated game. I show that repeated games generate a great diversity of behavioral equilibria, in support of the norm psychology hypothesis's premise. When interaction is repeated, adopting local norms is a more evolutionarily successful strategy than automatically cooperating. If various groups are at different behavioral equilibria, then cultural selection between groups tends to select for cooperative behavior.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print29.pdf,[]

We provide evidence that the evolution of a highly folded neocortex, as observed in humans, requires the traversal of a threshold of ∼109 neurons, and that species above and below the threshold exhibit a bimodal distribution of physiological and life-history traits, establishing two phenotypic groups. We identify, using discrete mathematical models, proliferative divisions of progenitors in the basal compartment of the developing neocortex as evolutionarily necessary and sufficient for generating a fourteen-fold increase in daily prenatal neuron production and thus traversal of the neuronal threshold. Finally, using RNA-seq data from fetal human neocortical germinal zones, we show a genomic correlate to the neuron threshold in the differential conservation of long intergenic non-coding RNA.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Biology/PLOS Biology1.pdf,"[( 16 Dec 2013 , 7), ( 26 Dec 2013 , 2), ( 25 Dec 2013 , 3), ( 19 Nov 2014 , 1), ( 15 Dec 2013 , 5)]"

Progress is hindered by common misunderstandings of how selection works in age-structured populations. I review two important results of life history theory related to demography. First, different life history strategies evolve under density-independent and density-dependent population growth. Second, and more poorly appreciated, different kinds of density-dependence also select for different life history strategies; assuming zero population growth alone is insufficient to determine the optimal strategy. I show that these facts are more than methodological niceties by reanalyzing the model by Kaplan et al.

When exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest computes a representation R of that signal which is then observed through a noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish to infer the ""filter"" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori knowledge of the ""noise function"" mapping R to M. In practice such noise functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show that, in the large data limit, this need for a pre-characterized noise function can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual information I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations. Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the Data Processing Inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained. We term these directions ""diffeomorphic modes"" and present an equation that allows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic modes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter space, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Neural Computation/Neural Computation1.pdf,"[( 18 Dec 2013 , 4)]"

The approach leverages careful variant site filtering and a novel iterative reweighting procedure to generate high-accuracy trees while considering variants in regions of chrY that had previously been excluded from analyses based on short-read sequencing data. It is argued that the proposed approach is also superior to previous region-based filtering approaches in that it adapts to the quality of the underlying data and will automatically allow the scope of sites considered to expand as the underlying data quality improves (e.g. through longer read lengths). Key related issues, including calling of genotypes for the hemizygous chrY, reliability of variant results, read mismappings and ""heterozygous"" genotype calls, and the mutational stability of different variants are discussed and taken into account. The methodology is demonstrated through application to a dataset consisting of 1292 male samples from diverse populations and haplogroups, with the majority coming from low-coverage sequencing by the 1000 Genomes Project. Application of the tree-generation approach to these data produces a tree involving over 120,000 chrY variant sites (about 45,000 sites if singletons are excluded). The utility of this approach in refining the Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree is demonstrated by examining results for several haplogroups.

Most historians, as well as geneticists, situate them as the descendants of Israelite tribes whose presence in Europe is owed to deportations during the Roman conquest of Palestine, as well as migration from Babylonia, and eventual settlement along the Rhine.  By contrast, a few historians and other writers, most famously Arthur Koestler, have looked to migrations following the decline of the little-understood Medieval Jewish kingdom of Khazaria as the main source for Ashkenazi Jewry.  A recent study of genetic variation in southeastern European populations (Elhaik 2012) also proposed a Khazarian origin for Ashkenazi Jews, eliciting considerable criticism from other scholars investigating Jewish ancestry who favor a Near Eastern origin of Ashkenazi populations.  This paper re-examines the genetic data and analytical approaches used in these studies of Jewish ancestry, and situates them in the context of historical, linguistic, and archaeological evidence from the Caucasus, Europe and the Near East.

The term effect indicates that it represents causal information, which is different from standard statistical concepts as regression coefficient and association. The process of inferring causal information is also different from standard statistical learning, as the former requires causal (i.e. non-statistical) assumptions and involves extra complexities. Remarkably, the task of inferring genetic effects is largely seen as a standard regression/prediction problem, contradicting its label. This widely accepted analysis approach is by itself insufficient for causal learning, suggesting that causality is not the point for selection. Given this incongruence, it is important to verify if genomic predictors need to represent causal effects to be relevant for selection decisions, especially because applying regression studies to answer causal questions may lead to wrong conclusions. The answer to this question defines if genomic selection models should be constructed aiming maximum genomic predictive ability or aiming identifiability of genetic causal effects. Here, we demonstrate that selection relies on a causal effect from genotype to phenotype, and that genomic predictors are only useful for selection if they distinguish such effect from other sources of association. Conversely, genomic predictors capturing non-causal signals provide information that is less relevant for selection regardless of the resulting predictive ability. Focusing on covariate choice decision, simulated examples are used to show that predictive ability, which is the criterion normally used to compare models, may not indicate the quality of genomic predictors for selection.

The ubiquity and importance of short duplex RNAs, termed microRNA (miRNA), for
normal development in higher eukaryotes are becoming increasingly clear. We had
previously shown that reduction-of-function mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana DCL1
(DICER-LIKE1) gene, affecting the nucleus-localized protein that produces 19-25
nucleotides long miRNA species from longer double stranded RNA precursors, cause a
delay in flowering by prolonging the period of juvenile organ development. Here we
show that DCL1 transcription is increased at the critical phase of juvenile to reproductive
developmental transition, and that DCL1 protein is localized in meristematic cells of the
shoot, inflorescence and flowering meristem. DCL1 protein is also expressed in the
ovule funiculus, ovule integuments, and in early but not late embryo. Genetic analysis
revealed that DCL1 exerts its effect along the same pathway that involves the floral
pathway integrator gene LEAFY. Results are most consistent with the idea that DCL1
protein is required in the shoot apical meristem to prevent uncontrolled proliferation of
meristematic cells. The expression of DCL1 protein in the early embryo may be either
via the transmission of DCL1 mRNA through the female gametophyte, as suggested from
the sporophytic maternal effect of dcl1-8 on early embryo development, or from DCL1
mRNA synthesized in early embryo cells off the maternally transmitted allele. The
requirement of an active maternally transmitted allele of DCL1 for normal early embryo
development, and the presence of DCL1 protein in the early embryo, together suggest
that the synthesis of miRNA in early embryo cells is critical for development, but does
not rule out potential maternal contribution of miRNA or its precursor molecules into the
embryo. (Manuscript was prepared on February 2, 2007, and has been unaltered since)",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print34.pdf,[]

Cultural group selection and parochial altruism are popular but controversial evolutionary explanations for large-scale cooperation. Proponents of the cultural group selection hypothesis argue that the human tendency to conform - a consequence of our reliance on social learning - maintained sufficient between-group variation to allow group selection (which favors altruism) to overpower individual selection (which favors selfishness), whereupon large-scale altruism could emerge. Proponents of the parochial altruism hypothesis argue that altruism could emerge in tandem with hostility toward other groups if the combination of the two traits increased success in inter-group contests. Proponents of both hypotheses assume that cooperation is altruistic and that within-group conflict is antithetical to cooperation, implying that group selection for cooperation reduces within-group conflict. Yet within-group conflict need not be antithetical to cooperation. This essay uses a mathematical model to show that selection between groups can lead to greater within-group aggression if within-group aggression enhances the value of individually costly public goods contributions. This model may help to explain cross-cultural associations between warfare, socialization for aggression, aggressive sports, and interpersonal violence among humans. It may also apply to other forms of inter-group conflict among humans.

Two critical components of NMA methods are coarse-graining in the level of simplification used to represent protein structures and the choice of potential energy functional form.

In one extreme one finds accurate but slow molecular-dynamics based methods with all-atom representations and detailed atom potentials.

Here we introduce a new application for NMA methods with the use of ENCoM in the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability. While existing methods are based on machine learning or enthalpic considerations, the use of ENCoM, based on vibrational normal modes, is based on entropic considerations. This represents a novel area of application for NMA methods and a novel approach for the prediction of the effect of mutations. We compare ENCoM to a large number of methods in terms of accuracy and self-consistency. We show that the accuracy of ENCoM is comparable to that of the best existing methods.

Rates of protein movement between cellular compartments can be measured by FRAP. However, no standard and reliable methods to calculate transport rates exist. Here we introduce a method to extract import and export rates, suitable for noisy single cell data. This method consists of microscope procedures, routines for data processing, an ODE model to fit to the data, and algorithms for parameter optimization and error estimation.
Using this method, we successfully measured import and export rates in individual yeast. For YFP, average transport rates were 0.15 sec-1. We estimated confidence intervals for these parameters through likelihood proﬁle analysis. We found large cell-to-cell variation (CV = 0.79) in these rates, suggesting a hitherto unknown source of cellular heterogeneity. Given the passive nature of YFP diffusion, we attribute this variation to large differences among cells in the number or quality of nuclear pores.

These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology of, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers en route to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1 and kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for SNX-coated early endosomes.

Here we combine a recently introduced dynamic programming algorithm for estimating species trees that bypasses MCMC integration over gene trees with sophisticated methods for estimating marginal likelihoods, needed for Bayesian model selection, to provide a rigorous and computationally tractable technique for genome-wide species delimitation. We provide a critical yet simple correction that brings the likelihoods of different species trees, and more importantly their corresponding marginal likelihoods, to the same common denominator, which enables direct and accurate comparisons of competing species delimitation models using Bayes factors. We test this approach, which we call Bayes factor delimitation (*with genomic data; BFD*), using common species delimitation scenarios with computer simulations. Varying the numbers of loci and the number of samples suggest that the approach can distinguish the true model even with few loci and limited samples per species. Misspecification of the prior for population size θ has little impact on support for the true model.

Second, as animals traverse through place fields, neurons sustain elevated firing rates for long periods, however this has received little attention. Third the theta-phase of spikes within this sustained activity varies with animal's location, termed phase-precession or a temporal code. The precise relationship between these properties and the mechanisms governing them are not understood, although distal visual cues (DVC) are thought to be sufficient to reliably elicit them. Hence, we measured rat CA1 neurons' activity during random foraging in two-dimensional VRwhere only DVC provide consistent allocentric location information and compared it with their activity in real world (RW).  Surprisingly, we found little spatial selectivity in VR. This is in sharp contrast to robust spatial selectivity commonly seen in one-dimensional RW and VR, or two-dimensional RW. Despite this, neurons in VR generated approximately two-second long phase precessing spike sequences, termed hippocampal motifs. Motifs, and Motif-fields, an aggregation of all motifs of a neuron, had qualitatively similar properties including theta-scale temporal coding in RW and VR, but the motifs were far less spatially localized in VR.

Does population size remain important when populations are subdivided and networks are realistically small? I use a mathematical model to show that population size has little effect on equilibrium levels of mean skill under a wide range of conditions. The effects of network size and transmission error rate usually overshadow that of population size. Population size can, however, affect the rate at which a population approaches equilibrium, by increasing the rate at which innovations arise. This effect is small unless innovation is very rare. Whether population size predicts technological complexity in the real world, then, depends on whether technological evolution is innovation-limited and short of equilibrium.

Quantifying the turnover of these cellular subclasses can provide important insights into the viral life cycle and the generation and maintenance of latently infected cells. 

Results: We used previously published data from five patients chronically infected with HIV-1 that initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Patient-matched PCR for unspliced and multiply spliced viral RNAs combined with limiting dilution analysis provided measurements of transcriptional profiles at the single cell level. Furthermore, measurement of intracellular transcripts and extracellular virion-enclosed HIV-1 RNA allowed us to distinguish productive from non-productive cells. We developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of plasma virus and the transcriptional subclasses of HIV-1-infected cells. Fitting the model to the data allowed us to better understand the phenotype of different transcriptional subclasses and their contribution to the overall turnover of HIV-1 before and during cART. The average number of virus-producing cells in peripheral blood is small during chronic infection (25.7 cells per ml). We find that 14.0%, 0.3% and 21.2% of infected cells become defectively, latently and persistently infected cells, respectively. Assuming that the infection is homogenous throughout the body, we estimate an average in vivo viral burst size of 2.1 x 10^4 virions per cell.

Conclusions: Our study provides novel quantitative insights into the turnover and development of different subclasses of HIV-1-infected cells. The model predicts that the pool of latently infected cells becomes rapidly established during the first months of acute infection and continues to increase slowly during the first years of chronic infection. Having a detailed understanding of this process will be useful for the evaluation of viral eradication strategies that aim to deplete the latent reservoir of HIV-1.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology2.pdf,"[( 20 Nov 2013 , 3), ( 21 Nov 2013 , 1)]"

Both stability and the function of appendages in generating maneuvering forces and torques changed as the glide angle or angle of attack were changed. These are significant because they represent an aerial environment that may have shifted during the evolution of directed aerial descent and other aerial behaviors. Certain movements were particularly effective (symmetric movements of the wings and tail in pitch, asymmetric wing movements, some tail movements). Other appendages altered their function from creating yaws at high angle of attack to

They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition and latitude; specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species. Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus. Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed atmaximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community.

Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a one-off catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.
Results
Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate.
Conclusions
Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of chromothripsis-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined chromthripsis phenomenon.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics2.pdf,"[( 13 Jan 2014 , 2), ( 15 Jan 2014 , 1), ( 30 Jan 2014 , 3), ( 14 Jan 2014 , 2), ( 29 Jan 2014 , 2)]"

We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1/NFE2L1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells.  We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP.  Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded promptly by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate.  However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER membrane.  Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol.

Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing or duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T or D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the tRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this issue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of finding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the ARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce complementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of erroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent criteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of these. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to inconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are apparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to have support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not rRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs lacking both the D and T arms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print46.pdf,"[( 18 Jan 2014 , 1)]"

Signatures of natural selection were detected by identifying seven outlier loci using two independent approaches: one based on outlier detection and another based on environmental correlations. Evidence of divergent selection at two candidate SNP loci, Oke_RFC2-168 and Oke_MARCKS-362, indicates significant environmental correlations, particularly with the number of frost-free days (NFFD). Important associations found between environmental variables and outlier loci indicate that those environmental variables could be the major driving forces of allele frequency divergence at the candidate loci. NFFD, in particular, may play an important adaptive role in shaping genetic variation in O. keta.

To address this problem, we propose a novel two-tiered screening system comprising an initial ""pooling"" screen that identifies miRNAs whose tissue-specific over-expression causes a phenotype of interest followed by a more focused secondary screen that uses gene-specific RNAi. As miRNAs inhibit translation or direct the destruction of their target mRNAs, any phenotype observed with miRNA over-expression can be attributed to the loss-of-function of one or more target mRNAs. Since miRNA-target pairing is sequence-specific, a list of predicted targets for miRNAs identified in the initial screen serves as a list of candidates for the secondary RNAi-based screen. These predicted miRNA targets can be prioritized by expression pattern, and if multiple miRNAs produce the same phenotype, overlapping target predictions can be given higher priority in the follow-up screen.

Since miRNAs are short, miRNA misexpression will likely uncover artifactual miRNA-target relationships. Thus, we are using miRNAs as a tool to accelerate genetic screening rather than focus on the biology of miRNAs themselves. This two-tiered system allows us to rapidly identify individual target genes involved in a phenomenon of interest, often in less than 200 crosses. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by identifying miRNAs that alter Drosophila odorant receptor expression. With subsequent miRNA target prediction and follow-up RNAi screening we identify and validate a novel role for the transcription factor Atf3 in the expression of the socially relevant receptor Or47b.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports1.pdf,"[( 27 Jan 2014 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2014 , 3)]"

Identifying SNPs under natural selection and underpinning species adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the Kingmans coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However, these theoretical models rely on biological and life-history assumptions which may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent theoretical developments of the so called multiple merger coalescent models are reviewed here (Λ-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Snitzman, Ξ-coalescent). We explicit how these new models take into account various pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as 1) the skew in offspring production typical of marine species, 2) fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in population sizes during epidemics, 3) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles, and 4) the high rates of extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations.

The flagellum on this species rotates counterclockwise to propel the bacterium, periodically ceasing rotation to enable reorientation. When rotation restarts the cell body usually points in a new direction. It has been assumed that the new direction is simply the result of Brownian rotation. We consider three variants of a self-propelled particle model of bacterial motility. The first considers rotational diffusion only, corresponding to a non-chemotactic mutant strain. A further two models also include stochastic reorientations, describing 'run-and-tumble' motility. We derive expressions for key summary statistics and simulate each model using a stochastic computational algorithm. We also discuss the effect of cell geometry on rotational diffusion. Working with a previously published tracking dataset, we compare predictions of the models with data on individual stopping events in R. sphaeroides.

Detecting aquatic macroorganisms with environmental DNA (eDNA) is a new survey method with broad applicability. However, the origin, state, and fate of aqueous macrobial eDNA - which collectively determine how well eDNA can serve as a proxy for directly observing organisms and how eDNA should be captured, purified, and assayed - are poorly understood. 
2. The size of aquatic particles provides clues about their origin, state, and fate. We used sequential filtration size fractionation to measure, for the first time, the particle size distribution (PSD) of macrobial eDNA, specifically Common Carp (hereafter referred to as Carp) eDNA. We compared it to the PSDs of total eDNA (from all organisms) and suspended particle matter (SPM). We quantified Carp mitochondrial eDNA using a custom qPCR assay, total eDNA with fluorometry, and SPM with gravimetric analysis.   
3. In a lake and a pond, we found Carp eDNA in particles from >180 to <0.2 µm, but it was most abundant from 1-10 µm. Total eDNA was most abundant below 0.2 µm and SPM was most abundant above 100 µm. SPM was ≤0.1% total eDNA, and total eDNA was ≤0.0004% Carp eDNA. 0.2 µm filtration maximized Carp eDNA capture (85%±6%) while minimizing total (i.e., non-target) eDNA capture (48%±3%), but filter clogging limited this pore size to a volume <250 mL. To mitigate this limitation we estimated a continuous PSD model for Carp eDNA and derived an equation for calculating isoclines of pore size and water volume that yield equivalent amounts of Carp eDNA. 
4. Our results suggest that aqueous macrobial eDNA predominantly exists inside mitochondria or cells, and that settling plays an important role in its fate. For optimal eDNA capture, we recommend 0.2 µm filtration or a combination of larger pore size and water volume that exceeds the 0.2 µm isocline. In situ filtration of large volumes could maximize detection probability when surveying large habitats for rare organisms. Our method for eDNA particle size analysis enables future research to compare the PSDs of eDNA from other organisms and environments, and to easily apply them for ecological monitoring.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Methods in Ecology and Evolution/Methods in Ecology and Evolution1.pdf,"[( 19 Mar 2014 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2014 , 2)]"

Prediction accuracy was lower for specialists than for generalists. 
Although climate variables represent the strongest drivers affecting butterfly species richness and composition for generalists, plant richness and habitat diversity are at least as important for specialist butterfly species.

However, little is known about the role of FMRP in regulating miRNA expression. Here, we found a development-dependant dynamic expression of Fmr1 mRNA (encoding FMRP) in mouse hippocampus with a small peak at postnatal day 7 (P7). MiRNA microarray analysis showed that the levels of 38 miRNAs showed a significant increase with about 15~250 folds and the levels of 26 miRNAs showed a significant decrease with only about 2~4 folds in the hippocampus of P7 Fmr1 KO mice. Q-PCR assay showed that 9 of the most increased miRNAs (>100 folds in microarrays) were increased about 40~70 folds and their pre-miRNAs were increased about 5~10 folds, but no significant difference in their pri-miRNA levels was observed, suggesting a role of FMRP in regulating miRNA processing from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. We further demonstrated that a set of protein-coding mRNAs, potentially targeted by the 9 miRNAs were down-regulated in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice.

A large carrying capacity coupled with appropriate parasitism effectiveness frequently drives long-term apparent oscillatory dynamics in population size. We name these oscillations due to the structure of the constitutive interaction among species as ecological. 

On the other hand, there are also exceptional cases when the evolving quantitative traits of the hosts and parasites induce oscillating population size, which we call as evolutionary. This oscillatory behavior is dependent on the speed of evolutionary adaptation and degree of evolutionary trade-off. A moderate level of negative trade-off is essential for the existence of oscillations.

Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computa- tional model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian Energy Landscape Tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and 3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptides α, β, and PPII conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accu- rate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELTs principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biophysical Journal/Biophysical Journal1.pdf,[]

The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis.  Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N=113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by ~445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring in utero.

There are currently to precise methods to estimate incremental selection occurring over limited periods.

Here, we conducted the first genome-wide association study on motion sickness in 80,494 individuals from the 23andMe database who were surveyed about car sickness.  Thirty-five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with motion sickness at a genome-wide-significant level (p< 5e-8).  Many of these SNPs are near genes involved in balance, and eye, ear, and cranial development (e.g., PVRL3, TSHZ1, MUTED, HOXB3, HOXD3). Other SNPs may affect motion sickness through nearby genes with roles in the nervous system, glucose homeostasis, or hypoxia.  We show that several of these SNPs display sex-specific effects, with as much as three times stronger effects in women.  We searched for comorbid phenotypes with motion sickness, confirming associations with known comorbidities including migraines, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), vertigo, and morning sickness, and observing new associations with altitude sickness and many gastrointestinal conditions.

These results point to the importance of the nervous system in motion sickness and suggest a role for glucose levels in motion-induced nausea and vomiting, a finding that may provide insight into other nausea-related phenotypes such as PONV.

Dysregulation of monoallelic gene expression has already been linked to several non-Mendelian inherited genetic disorders. In humans, DNA-methylation is deemed to be an important regulator of monoallelic gene expression, but only few examples are known. One important reason is that current, cost-affordable truly genome-wide methods to assess DNA-methylation are based on sequencing post enrichment. Here, we present a new methodology that combines methylomic data from MethylCap-seq with associated SNP profiles to identify monoallelically methylated loci. Using the Hardy-Weinberg theorem for each SNP locus, it could be established whether the observed frequency of samples featured by biallelic methylation was lower than randomly expected. Applied on 334 MethylCap-seq samples of very diverse origin, this resulted in the identification of 80 genomic regions featured by monoallelic DNA-methylation. Of these 80 loci, 49 are located in genic regions of which 25 have already been linked to imprinting. Further analysis revealed statistically significant enrichment of these loci in promoter regions, further establishing the relevance and usefulness of the method. Additional validation of the found loci was done using 14 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data sets. Importantly, the developed approach can be easily applied to other enrichment-based sequencing technologies, such as the ChIP-seq-based identification of monoallelic histone modifications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research3.pdf,"[( 04 Feb 2014 , 2), ( 05 Feb 2014 , 1)]"

At first sight, this makes it seem inadequate for bioinformatics applications that rely mostly on statistical parameters and optimisation. The prediction of protein interactions, or protein docking, is one such application. And this apparent problem with CP is particularly evident when constraints are provided by noisy data, as it is the case when using the statistical analysis of Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) to extract coevolution information. The goal of this paper is to show that this first impression is misleading and that CP is a useful technique for improving protein docking even with data as vague and noisy as the coevolution indicators that can be inferred from MSA. 
Results: Here we focus on the study of two protein complexes. In one case we used a simplified estimator of interaction propensity to infer a set of five candidate residues for the interface and used that set to constrain the docking models. Even with this simplified approach and considering only the interface of one of the partners, there is a visible focusing of the models around the correct configuration. Considering a set of 400 models with the best geometric contacts, this constraint increases the number of models close to the target (RMSD ¡5Å) from 2 to 5 and decreases the RMSD of all retained models from 26Å to 17.5Å. For the other example we used a more standard estimate of coevolving residues, from the Co-Evolution Analysis using Protein Sequences (CAPS) software. Using a group of three residues identified from the sequence alignment as potentially co-evolving to constrain the search, the number of complexes similar to the target among the 50 highest scoring docking models increased from 3 in the unconstrained docking to 30 in the constrained docking. 
Conclusions: Although only a proof-of-concept application, our results show that, with suitably designed constraints, CP allows us to integrate coevolution data, which can be inferred from databases of protein sequences, even though the data is noisy and often fuzzy, with no well-defined discontinuities. This also shows, more generally, that CP in bioinformatics needs not be limited to the more crisp cases of finite domains and explicit rules but can also be applied to a broader range of problems that depend on statistical measurements and continuous data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print55.pdf,[]

This adaptive process is modulated by reward, suggesting that ventral corticostriatal circuits may contribute to the process of conflict adaptation.  To evaluate this possibility, a group of healthy adults (N=30) were tested using functional MRI (fMRI) while they performed a color-word Stroop task.  In a conflict-related region of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), stronger BOLD responses predicted faster response times (RTs) on the next trial. More importantly, the degree of behavioral conflict adaptation on RTs was correlated with the magnitude of mOFC-RT associations on the previous trial, but only after accounting for network-level interactions with prefrontal and striatal regions. This suggests that conflict adaptation may rely on interactions between distributed corticostriatal circuits.  The convergence of white matter projections from frontal areas into the striatum was measured using diffusion weighted imaging.  In these pathways, greater convergence of coticostriatal projections correlated with stronger functional mOFC-RT associations that, in turn, provided an indirect pathway that linked anatomical structure to behavior.  Thus distributed corticostriatal processing may mediate the orbitofrontal cortexs influence on behavioral updating, even in the absence of explicit rewards.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print56.pdf,[]

Yet, low quality samples are at times the sole means of addressing specific questions  e.g., samples collected in the course of fieldwork. We sought to quantify the impact of variation in RNA quality on estimates of gene expression levels based on RNA-seq data. To do so, we collected expression data from tissue samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time prior to RNA extraction. The RNA samples we collected spanned the entire range of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (a quality metric commonly used to assess RNA quality). We observed widespread effects of RNA quality on measurements of gene expression levels, as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples.

In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) may trigger increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be <400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy. This study utilizes transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. These junctions are prominent features in these cells and we estimate that the membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. We also develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data. Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients show that the magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated L-SR junctional Ca2+ transients, we estimate that ""trigger zones"" with a 60-100 junctions are required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the 130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50 nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3.

From this point of view, they are similar to anaerobic digesters, however with methanogenesis replaced by anaerobic respiration with the anode as terminal electron acceptor. Bio-electrochemically they are similar to classical fuel cells where however the electrogenic redox reaction is part of the microbial metabolism rather than mediated by an inorganic catalyst.
In this paper, we analyse how electric power production in MFCs depends on the composition of the anodic biofilm in terms of metabolic capabilities of identified sets of species. MFCs were started with a natural inoculum and continuously fed with sucrose, a fermentable carbohydrate. The composition of the community, power and other environmental data were sampled over a period of a few weeks during the maturation of the anodic biofilm.
Our results support the hypothesis that an MFC with natural inoculum and fermentable feedstock is essentially a two stage system with fermentation followed by anode-respiration. Our results also show that under identical starting and operating 
conditions, MFCs with comparable power output can develop different anodic communities with no particular species dominant across all replicas. It is only important for good power production that all cells contain a sufficient fraction of low-potential anaerobic respirators, that is respirators that can use terminal electron acceptors with a low redox potential. We conclude with a number of hypotheses and recommendations for the operation of MFCs to ensure good electric yield.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Microbial Evolution/Microbial Evolution1.pdf,"[( 12 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 09 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 14 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 08 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 18 Feb 2014 , 1)]"

We used the open-ended digital evolution software Avida to examine how historic exposure to predation pressures, different levels of genetic variation, and combinations of the two, impact anti-predator strategies and competitive abilities evolved in the face of threats from new, invasive, predator populations. We show that while standing genetic variation plays some role in determining evolutionary responses, evolutionary history has the greater influence on a populations capacity to evolve effective anti-predator traits.

As individual research labs, rather than centralized centers, begin to sequence the majority of new genomes, it is important to establish best practices for genome assembly. However, recent evaluations such as GAGE and the Assemblathon have concluded that there is no single best approach to genome assembly. Instead, it is preferable to generate multiple assemblies and validate them to determine which is most useful for the desired analysis; this is a labor-intensive process that is often impossible or unfeasible.
Results: To encourage best practices supported by the community, we present iMetAMOS, an automated ensemble assembly pipeline; iMetAMOS encapsulates the process of running, validating, and selecting a single assembly from multiple assemblies. iMetAMOS packages several leading open-source tools into a single binary that automates parameter selection and execution of multiple assemblers, scores the resulting assemblies based on multiple validation metrics, and annotates the assemblies for genes and contaminants. We demonstrate the utility of the ensemble process on 225 previously unassembled Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as well as a Rhodobacter sphaeroides benchmark dataset. On these real data, iMetAMOS reliably produces validated assemblies and identifies potential contamination without user intervention. In addition, intelligent parameter selection produces assemblies of R. sphaeroides that exceed the quality of those from the GAGE-B evaluation, affecting the relative ranking of some assemblers.
Conclusions: Ensemble assembly with iMetAMOS provides users with multiple, validated assemblies for each genome. Although computationally limited to small or mid-sized genomes, this approach is the most effective and reproducible means for generating high-quality assemblies and enables users to select an assembly best tailored to their specific needs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics2.pdf,"[( 24 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 20 Mar 2014 , 3), ( 08 Feb 2014 , 7), ( 12 Feb 2014 , 2), ( 09 Feb 2014 , 9), ( 14 Feb 2014 , 6), ( 11 Feb 2014 , 4), ( 15 Feb 2014 , 3), ( 07 Feb 2014 , 11), ( 13 Mar 2014 , 3), ( 09 May 2014 , 1), ( 10 Feb 2014 , 17)]"

Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. Here we develop three biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. The first index is based on the geometric mean abundance of species. A second uses a more general power mean. A third integrates both the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants, and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggests that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1% from 1970 to 2009.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Conservation Biology/Conservation Biology2.pdf,"[( 25 Nov 2013 , 1), ( 22 Nov 2013 , 3), ( 10 Feb 2014 , 5), ( 21 Nov 2013 , 4)]"

We find that expression of protease-dead separase is dominant-negative in C. elegans embryos. The C. elegans embryo is an ideal system to study developmental processes in a genetically tractable system. However, a major limitation is the lack of an inducible gene expression system for the embryo. The most common method for embryonic expression involves generation of integrated transgenes under the control of the pie-1 promoter, using unc-119 as a selection marker. However expression of dominant-negative proteins kills the strain preventing analysis of mutants. We have developed two methods that allow for the propagation of lines carrying dominant-negative transgenes in order to study protease-dead separase in embryos. The first involves feeding gfp RNAi to eliminate transgene expression and allows propagation of transgenic lines indefinitely. Animals removed from gfp RNAi for several generations recover transgene expression and associated phenotypes. The second involves propagation of the transgene with the female specific pie-1 promoter via the male germline and analysis of phenotypes in embryos from F1 heterozygous hermaphrodites that express the protein. Using these methods, we show that protease-dead separase causes chromosome nondisjunction and cytokinesis failures. These methods are immediately applicable for studies of dominant-negative transgenes and should open new lines of investigation in the C. elegans embryo.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print61.pdf,"[( 13 May 2014 , 1), ( 07 Feb 2014 , 2)]"

These coevolved via a `Cambrian explosion' until, very early on, the ancestor of the present narrow spectrum of protein machineries became evolutionarily locked in at a modest level of fitness reflecting a modest embedding metabolic free energy ecology. Similar biochemical `Cambrian singularities' must have occurred at different scales and levels of organization on Earth, with competition or chance-selected outcomes frozen at a far earlier period than the physical bauplan Cambrian explosion. Other examples might include explosive variations in mechanisms of photosynthesis and subsequent oxygen metabolisms. Intermediate between Cambrian bauplan and genetic code, variants of both remain today, even after evolutionary pruning, often protected in specialized ecological niches.

ensemble activity by facilitating lateral inhibition among MTs, and/or they may enforce
temporally-precise activity locked to breathing. Yet, the selectivity and temporal structure
of GC activity during wakefulness are unknown. We recorded GCs in the MOB of
anesthetized and awake mice and reveal pronounced state-dependent features of odor
coding and temporal patterning. Under anesthesia, GCs exhibit sparse activity and are
strongly and synchronously coupled to the respiratory cycle. Upon waking, GCs
desynchronize, broaden their odor responses, and typically fire without regard for the
respiratory rhythm. Thus during wakefulness, GCs exhibit stronger odor responses with
less temporal structure. Based on these observations, we propose that during wakefulness

We have investigated how the specificity of this behaviour affects evolutionary dynamics  using a set of coupled logistic equations, where the carrying capacity of each genotype consists of two components: an intrinsic part and a contribution from all genotypes present in the population. The relative contribution of the two components is controlled by a specificity parameter γ, and we show that the ability of a mutant to invade a resident population depends strongly on this parameter. When the carrying capacity is intrinsic, selection is almost exclusively for mutants with higher carrying capacity, while a shared carrying capacity yields selection purely on growth rate.

However, gene family curation is often only inferred from DNA sequence homology and lacks insights into evolutionary processes contributing to gene family dynamics. In a comparative genomics framework, we integrated multiple lines of evidence provided by gene synteny, sequence homology and protein-based Hidden Markov Modelling to extract homologous super-clusters composed of multi-domain resistance (R)-proteins of the NB-LRR type (for NUCLEOTIDE BINDING/LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS), that are involved in plant innate immunity. To assess the diversity of R-proteins within and between species, we screened twelve eudicot plant genomes including six major crops and found a total of 2,363 NB-LRR genes. Our curated R-proteins set shows a 50% average for tandem duplicates and a 22% fraction of gene copies retained from ancient polyploidy events (ohnologs). We provide evidence for strong positive selection acting on all identified genes and show significant differences in molecular evolution rates (Ka/Ks-ratio) among tandem- (mean=1.59), ohnolog (mean=1.36) and singleton (mean=1.22) R-gene duplicates.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature which suggested a statistically significant difference. However, the studies included were heavily underpowered: on average only 20% power to detect differences of 0.3 standard deviations, which makes it difficult to establish the reality of such a difference. We therefore studied the size of the corpus callosum among 694 subjects (328 patients, 366 controls) from the Abide cohort. Despite having achieved 99% power to detect statistically significant differences of 0.3 standard deviations, we did not observe any. To better understand the neuroanatomical diversity of the corpus callosum, and the possible reasons for the previous findings, we analysed the relationship between its size, the size of the brain, intracranial volume and intelligence scores. The corpus callosum appeared to scale non-linearly with brain size, with large brains having a proportionally smaller corpus callosum. Additionally, intelligence scores correlated with brain volume among controls but the correlation was significantly weaker among patients. We used simulations to determine to which extent these two effects could lead to artefactual differences in corpus callosum size within populations. We observed that, were there a difference in brain volume between cases and controls, normalising corpus callosum size by brain volume would not eliminate the brain volume effect, but adding brain volume as a covariate in a linear model would. Finally, we observed that because of the weaker correlation of intelligence scores and brain volume among patients, matching populations by intelligence scores could result in a bias towards including more patients with large brain volumes, inducing an artificial difference. Overall, our results highlight the necessity for open data sharing efforts such as Abide to provide a more solid ground for the discovery of neuroimaging biomarkers, within the context of the wide human neuroanatomical diversity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biological Psychiatry/Biological Psychiatry1.pdf,"[( 25 Mar 2017 , 3), ( 10 May 2014 , 1), ( 15 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 14 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 16 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 27 Oct 2014 , 3), ( 18 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 26 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 17 Feb 2014 , 1)]"

Fundamental questions concerning the origin of polyploid lineages (e.g., auto- vs. allopolyploidy) and the extent to which polyploid genomes display different modes of inheritance are poorly resolved for most polyploids, not least because they have hitherto required detailed karyotypic analysis or the analysis of allele segregation at multiple loci in pedigrees or artificial crosses, which are often not practical for non-model species. However, the increasing availability of sequence data for non-model species now presents an opportunity to apply established approaches for the evolutionary analysis of genomic data to polyploid species complexes. Here, we ask whether approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), applied to sequence data produced by next-generation sequencing technologies from polyploid taxa,  allows correct inference of the evolutionary and demographic history of polyploid lineages and their close relatives. We use simulations to investigate how the number of sampled individuals, the number of surveyed loci and their length affect the accuracy and precision of evolutionary and demographic inferences by ABC, including the mode of polyploidisation, mode of inheritance of polyploid taxa, the relative timing of genome duplication and speciation, and effective populations sizes of contributing lineages. We also apply the ABC framework we develop to sequence data from diploid and polyploidy species of the plant genus Capsella, for which we infer an allopolyploid origin for tetra C. bursa-pastoris ≈ 90,000 years ago.

CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. Here we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be 'restarted&' in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.

Some passengers can be deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression that is described by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers meltdown. We find support for the model in cancer age-incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to rationalize successes and failures of different treatment strategies. We find that a tumors load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies.

We found that spatial structure suppresses conjugation in surface-associated growth because strong genetic drift leads to spatial isolation of donor and recipient cells, restricting conjugation to rare boundaries between donor and recipient strains.

Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimising the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation.

Recent findings indicate that the genomic repeat elements (such as LINES, SINES and LTRs) could play an important role in the transcription control. Hence, it is important to further explore the role of genomic repeat elements in the gene expression regulation, and perhaps in other molecular processes. Although many computational tools exists for repeat element analysis, almost all of them simply identify and/or classifying the genomic repeat elements within query sequence(s); none of them facilitate identification of repeat elements that are likely to have a functional significance, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation.
Result: We developed the 'Genomic Repeat Element Analyzer for Mammals' (GREAM) to allow gene-centric analysis of genomic repeat elements in 17 mammalian species, and validated it by comparing with some of the existing experimental data. The output provides a categorized list of the specific type of transposons, retro-transposons and other genome-wide repeat elements that are statistically over-represented across specific neighborhood regions of query genes. The position and frequency of these elements, within the specified regions, are displayed as well. The tool also offers queries for position-specific distribution of repeat elements within chromosomes. In addition, GREAM facilitates the analysis of repeat element distribution across the neighborhood of orthologous genes.

Subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from which genomic DNA was isolated. The V3-V5 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified, allowing quantification of bacterial load and identification of communities by 16S rRNA qPCR and pyrosequencing.
 
Results: Our 65 IPF patients had 3.9x109 copies of the 16S rRNA gene per ml of BAL, two-fold more than the 1.8x109 copies in 44 sex- and smoking-matched controls (P<0.0001).

As this fact violates the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle we have reformulated the principle.

We investigate the causes of the above problems through mathematical analysis and computer simulations of sound mixtures, and find that surprisingly, the culprit appears to be non-biological in origin, but primarily due to the envelope-based signal processing algorithms currently used. This distortion is generated before the signal even enters the cochlea. Hence, the long-held belief that inter-electrode interference or current spreading is the cause, appears incorrect.

In total 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by ten teams using 12 different alignment pipelines.
Conclusions: We found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments, indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable difference in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions, and found few tools aligned the duplications analysed. We found many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances. We provide all datasets, submissions and assessment programs for further study, and provide, as a resource for future benchmarking, a convenient repository of code and data for reproducing the simulation assessments.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research2.pdf,"[( 18 Mar 2014 , 5), ( 15 Mar 2014 , 11), ( 25 Mar 2014 , 1), ( 28 Mar 2014 , 1), ( 20 Mar 2014 , 1), ( 10 Mar 2014 , 10), ( 13 Mar 2014 , 1), ( 11 Mar 2014 , 12)]"

In particular, histone modification data generated by the ENCODE project and other large-scale projects show specific patterns associated with regulatory elements in the human genome.It is important to build a unified statistical model to decipher the patterns of multiple histone modifications in a cell type to annotate chromatin states such as transcription start sites, enhancers and transcribed regions rather than to map histone modifications individually to regulatory elements.
Several genome-wide statistical models have been developed based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). These methods typically use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the model.Here we used spectral learning, a state-of-the-art parameter estimation algorithm in machine learning.We found that spectral learning plus a few (up to five) iterations of local optimization of the likelihood outperforms the standard EM algorithm.We also evaluated our software implementation called Spectacle on independent biological datasets and found that Spectacle annotated experimentally defined functional elements such as enhancers significantly better than a previous state-of-the-art method.

A high immediate mortality rate of released animals is an important cause of translocation failure (release cost). Post-release dispersal (i.e. the movements from the release site to the first breeding site) has recently been identified as another source of local translocation failure. In spite of their potential effects on conservation program outcomes, little is known about the quantitative effects of these two sources of translocation failure and their interactions with environmental factors and management designs. 
2.	Based on long-term monitoring data of captive-bred North African houbara bustards (hereafter, houbaras) over large spatial scales, we investigated the relative effects of release (e.g., release group size, period of release), individual (e.g., sex and body condition) and meteorological (e.g., temperature and rainfall) conditions on post-release survival (N = 957 houbaras) and dispersal (N = 436 houbaras). 
3.	We found that (i) rainfall and ambient air temperature had respectively a negative and a positive effect on houbara post-release dispersal distance, (ii) in interaction with the release period, harsh meteorological conditions had negative impact on the survival of houbaras, (iii) density dependent processes influenced the pattern of departure from the release site and (iv) post-release dispersal distance was male-biased, as natal dispersal of wild birds (although the dispersal patterns and movements may be influenced by different processes in captive-bred and in wild birds). 
4.	Synthesis and applications. Overall, our results demonstrate that post-release dispersal and mortality costs in translocated species may be mediated by meteorological factors, which in turn can be buffered by the release method. As the consequences of translocation programs on population dynamics depend primarily upon release costs and colonisation process, we suggest that their potential interactions with meteorological conditions be carefully addressed in future programs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print88.pdf,[]

Particularly, the phenomenon of aneuploidy - gains and losses of large genomic regions, i.e. whole chromosomes or chromosome arms - and why most cancer cells are aneuploid remains enigmatic. Another frequent observation in many different types of cancer is the deregulation of the homeostasis of the trace elements copper, zinc and iron. Concentrations of copper are markedly increased in cancer tissue and the blood plasma of cancer patients, while zinc levels are typically decreased. Here we discuss the hypothesis that the disruption of trace element homeostasis and the phenomenon of aneuploidy might be linked. Our tentative analysis of genomic data from diverse tumor types mainly from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project suggests that gains and losses of metal transporter genes occur frequently and correlate well with transporter gene expression levels. Hereby they may confer a cancer-driving selective growth advantage at early and possibly also later stages during cancer development. This idea is consistent with recent observations in yeast, which suggest that through chromosomal gains and losses cells can adapt quickly to new carbon sources, nutrient starvation as well as to copper toxicity. In human cancer development, candidate driving events may include, among others, the gains of zinc transporter genes SLC39A1 and SLC39A4 on chromosome arms 1q and 8q, respectively, and the losses of zinc transporter genes SLC30A5, SLC39A14 and SLC39A6 on 5q, 8p and 18q. The recurrent gain of 3q might be associated with the iron transporter gene TFRC and the loss of 13q with the copper transporter gene ATP7B. By altering cellular trace element homeostasis such events might contribute to the initiation of the malignant transformation. Intriguingly, attenuation or overexpression of several of these metal transporter genes has been shown to lead to malignant cellular behavior in vitro. Consistently, it has been shown that zinc affects a number of the observed ""hallmarks of cancer"" characteristics including DNA repair, inflammation and apoptosis, e.g. through its effects on NF-kappa B signaling. We term this model the ""aneuploidy metal transporter cancer"" (AMTC) hypothesis and find it compatible with the cancer-promoting role of point mutations and focal copy number alterations in established tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes (e.g. MYC, MYCN, TP53, PIK3CA, BRCA1, ERBB2). We suggest a number of approaches for how this hypothesis could be tested experimentally and briefly touch on possible implications for cancer etiology, metastasis, drug resistance and therapy.
-----------------------ABSTRACT_FOR_KIDS-----------------------  We humans are made up of many very small building blocks, which are called cells. These cells can be seen with a microscope and they know how to grow and what to do from the information on the DNA of their chromosomes. Sometimes, if this information is messed up, a cell can go crazy and start to grow without control, even in places of the body where it should not. This process is called cancer, a terrible disease that makes people very sick. Scientists do not understand exactly what causes cells to go crazy, so it would be good to find out. Many years ago, scientists observed that chromosomes in these cancer cells are missing or doubled but could not find an explanation for it. More recently, scientists have detected that precious metals to our bodies, which are not gold and silver, but zinc, iron and copper, are not found in the right amounts in these crazy cancer cells. There seems to be not enough zinc and iron but too much copper, and again, scientists do not really understand why. So there are many unanswered questions about these crazy cancer cells and in this article, we describe a pretty simple idea on how chromosome numbers and the metals might be connected: we think that the missing or doubled chromosomes produce less or more transporters of zinc, iron and copper. As a result, cancer cells end up with little zinc and too much copper and these changes contribute to their out-of-control growth. If this idea were true, many people would be excited about it. But first this idea needs to be investigated more deeply in the laboratory, on the computer and in the hospitals. Therefore, we put it out on the internet so that other people can also think about and work on our idea. Now there are plenty of ways to do exciting experiments and with the results, we will hopefully understand much better why cancer cells go crazy and how doctors could improve their therapies to help patients in the future.
-----------------------ABSTRACT_FOR_ADULTS----------------------- One hundred years ago, it was suggested that cancer is a disease of the chromosomes, based on the observations that whole chromosomes or chromosome arms are missing or duplicated in the genomes of cells in a tumor. This phenomenon is called ""aneuploidy"" and is observed in most types of cancer, including breast, lung, prostate, brain and other cancers. However, it is not clear which genes could be responsible for this observation or if this phenomenon is only a side effect of cancer without importance, so it is important to find out. A second observation from basic research is that concentrations of several micronutrients, especially of the trace elements zinc, copper and iron are changed in tumor cells. In this article, we speculate that aneuploidy is the reason for these changes and that together, these two phenomena are responsible for some of the famous hallmarks or characteristics that are known from cancer cells: fast growth, escape from destruction by the immune system and poor DNA repair. This idea is new and has not been tested yet. We name it the ""aneuploidy metal transporter cancer"" (AMTC) hypothesis. To test our idea we used a wealth of information that was shared by international projects such as the Human Genome Project or the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Indeed, we find that many zinc, iron and copper transporter genes in the genome are affected by aneuploidy. While a healthy cell has two copies of each gene, some tumor cells have only one or three copies of these genes. Furthermore, the amounts of protein and the activities of these metal transporters seem to correlate with these gene copy numbers, at least we see that the intermediate molecules and protein precursors called messenger RNA correlate well. Hence, we found that the public data is compatible with our suggested link between metal transporters and cancer. Furthermore, we identified hundreds of studies on zinc biology, evolutionary biology, genome and cancer research that also seem compatible. For example, cancer risk increases in the elderly population as well as in obese people, it also increases after certain bacterial or viral infections and through alcohol consumption.

Using ChIP-Seq, Hi-C and 3D modelling techniques, we found that the borders of the ~2,000 TADs in these cells are largely maintained after hormone treatment but that some TADs operate as discrete regulatory units in which the majority of the genes are either transcriptionally activated or repressed upon hormone stimulus. The epigenetic signatures of the TADs are coordinately modified by hormone in correlation with the transcriptional changes. Hormone-induced changes in gene activity and chromatin remodeling are accompanied by differential structural changes for activated and repressed TADs. In response to hormone activated TADs exhibit higher density of internal contacts, while repressed TADs show less intra-TAD contacts. Integrative 3D modelling revealed that TADs structurally expanded if activated and compacted when repressed, and that this is accompanied by differential changes in their global accessibility.

It calculates ""consensus rate"" between any two samples as how frequently they are grouped together in repeated clustering runs under a certain degree of random perturbation. The pairwise consensus rates form a between-sample similarity matrix, which has been used (1) as a visual proof that clusters exist, (2) for comparing stability among clusters, and (3) for estimating the optimal number (K) of clusters. However, the sensitivity and specificity of CC have not been systemically studied.  To assess its performance, we investigated the most common implementations of CC; and compared CC with other popular methods that also focus on cluster stability and estimation of K. We evaluated these methods using simulated datasets with either known structure or known absence of structure. Our results showed that (1) CC was able to divide randomly generated unimodal data into pre-specified numbers of clusters, and was able to show apparent stability of these chance partitions of known cluster-less data; (2) for data with known structure, the proportion of ambiguously clustered (PAC) pairs infers the known number of clusters more reliably than several commonly used K estimating methods; and (3) validation of the optimal K by choosing the most discriminant genes from the discovery cohort and applying them in an independent cohort often exaggerates the confidence in K due to inherent gene-gene correlations among the selected genes. While these results do not yet prove that any of the published studies using CC has generated false positive findings, they show that datasets with subtle or no structure are fully capable of producing strong evidence of consensus clustering.

The five patterns explained approximately 80% of the whole NP pattern on the genome in mouse C2C12 cells. We further performed ChIP-Seq using the input obtained from the fixed MNase-Seq.

Here we use a population genetic model to explore the interaction of temporal and spatial variation in the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic switching. We find that spatial variation in selection is important; when selection pressures are similar across space, migration can decrease the rate of switching, but when selection pressures differ spatially, increasing migration between demes can facilitate the evolution of higher rates of switching.

One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after some major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its lower-level units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is unknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a recent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique platform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an evolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast lineages evolved a multicellular snowflake-like cluster form in response to gravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved higher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart and form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity selection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create a mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast clusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry of the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find that the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the available space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in clusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher numbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the increased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total numbers of collectives.

Sustained activity of the oxidase requires that charge movements across the membrane are balanced. A role for the proton channel, HVCN1, has been proposed but not proven. Using the ratiometric pH indicator SNARF, introduced into the cytosol and separately into the vacuole coupled to Candida, we used confocal microscopy to measure changes in pH in these two compartments in human and mouse neutrophils. Shortly after phagocytosis by human cells, the vacuolar pH rose to 9, at which it was maintained for ~20 minutes, while the cytosol showed a small acidification of ~0.25 pH unit. Alkalinisation has important consequences for the microbicidal and digestive functions of vacuolar enzymes. In HVCN1 knock out mouse neutrophils, the phagocytosis induced respiratory burst was halved to ~3 fmols per Candida, the vacuolar pH rose to >11 and the cytosol acidified excessively to pH ~6.75. These changes were prevented by the protonophore CCCP. The rate of extrusion of protons into the extracellular medium following phagocytosis was not significantly different from wild type neutrophils suggesting that cytoplasmic acidification resulted from the loss of the proton sink into the vacuole. HVCN1 phagocytic vacuoles showed considerable swelling, and this was blocked by CCCP and decreased by valinomycin. Stoichiometric considerations indicated that the HVCN1 channel compensates 90-95% of the oxidase-induced charge in normal cells, and in its absence, charge is carried by ions other than protons, including K+.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE18.pdf,"[( 28 Mar 2014 , 1)]"

Not only is disease present for all colonies but long-term dynamics over 20 months revealed disease is a permanent feature.

Natural biological systems, such as biofilms, shells, and skeletal tissues, implement dynamic regulatory programs to assemble complex multiscale materials comprised of living and non-living components. Such systems can provide inspiration for the design of heterogeneous functional systems which integrate biotic and abiotic materials via hierarchical self-assembly. Here, we present a synthetic-biology platform for synthesizing and patterning self-assembled functional amyloid materials across multiple length scales with bacterial biofilms. We engineered Escherichia coli curli amyloid production under the tight control of synthetic regulatory circuits and interfaced amyloids with inorganic materials to create a biofilm-based electrical switch whose conductance can be selectively toggled by specific environmental signals. Furthermore, we externally tuned synthetic biofilms to build nanoscale amyloid biomaterials with different structure and composition through the controlled expression of their constituent subunits with artificial gene circuits. By using synthetic cell-cell communication, our engineered biofilms can also autonomously manufacture dynamic materials whose structure and composition change with time. In addition, we show that by combining subunit-level protein engineering, controlled genetic expression of self-assembling subunit proteins, and macroscale spatial gradients, synthetic biofilms can pattern protein biomaterials across multiple length scales. This work lays a foundation for synthesizing, patterning, and controlling composite materials with engineered biological systems. We envision that this approach can be expanded to other cellular and biomaterials contexts for the construction of self-organizing, environmentally responsive, and tunable multiscale composite materials with heterogeneous functionalities.

Systematic evaluation reveals Cas9 lines with ubiquitous or germline restricted patterns of activity. We also demonstrate differential activity of the same gRNA expressed from different U6 snRNA promoters, with the previously untested U6:3 promoter giving the most potent effect. Choosing an appropriate combination of Cas9 and gRNA allows targeting of essential and non-essential genes with transmission rates ranging from 25% - 100%. We also provide evidence that our optimized CRISPR/Cas tools can be used for offset nicking-based mutagenesis and, in combination with oligonucleotide donors, to precisely edit the genome by homologous recombination with efficiencies that do not require the use of visible markers. Lastly, we demonstrate a novel application of CRISPR/Cas-mediated technology in revealing loss-of-function phenotypes in somatic cells following efficient biallelic targeting by Cas9 expressed in a ubiquitous or tissue-restricted manner.

Histograms of k-mer frequencies can give valuable insight into the underlying distribution and indicate the error rate and genome size sampled in the sequencing experiment.

Results: We present KmerStream, a streaming algorithm for computing statistics for high throughput sequencing data based on the frequency of k-mers. The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the input and the space requirement are logarithmic in the size of the input. This very low space requirement allows us to deal with much larger datasets than previously presented algorithms. We derive a simple model that allows us to estimate the error rate of the sequencing experiment, as well as the genome size, using only the aggregate statistics reported by KmerStream and validate the accuracy on sequences from a PhiX control.
As an application we show how KmerStream can be used to compute the error rate of a DNA sequencing experiment. We run KmerStream on a set of 2656 whole genome sequenced individuals and compare the error rate to quality values reported by the sequencing equipment. We discover that while the quality values alone are largely reliable as a predictor of error rate, there is considerable variability in the error rates between sequencing runs, even when accounting for reported quality values.

One of the most sophisticated data structures for representing an entire population of genomes is a compressed de Bruijn graph. The graph structure can robustly represent simple SNPs to complex structural variations far beyond what can be done from linear sequences alone. As such there is a strong need to develop algorithms that can efficiently construct and analyze these graphs.

Results: In this paper we explore the deep topological relationships between the suffix tree and the compressed de Bruijn graph. We introduce a novel O(n log n) time and space algorithm called splitMEM, that directly constructs the compressed de Bruijn graph for a pan-genome of total length n. To achieve this time complexity, we augment the suffix tree with suffix skips, a new construct that allows us to traverse several suffix links in constant time, and use them to efficiently decompose maximal exact matches (MEMs) into the graph nodes. We demonstrate the utility of splitMEM by analyzing the pan- genomes of 9 strains of Bacillus anthracis and 9 strains of Escherichia coli to reveal the properties of their core genomes.

However, how population structure and gene flow (i.e., migration) affect adaptive evolution is not well understood. Here, we studied the impact of migration on asexually reproducing evolving computer programs (digital organisms). We found that digital organisms evolve the highest fitness values at intermediate migration rates, and we tested three hypotheses that could potentially explain this observation: (i) migration promotes passage through fitness valleys, (ii) migration increases genetic variation, and (iii) migration reduces clonal interference through a process called leapfrogging. We found that migration had no appreciable effect on the number of fitness valleys crossed and that genetic variation declined monotonously with increasing migration rates, instead of peaking at the optimal migration rate. However, the number of leapfrogging events, in which a superior beneficial mutation emerges on a genetic background that predates the previously best genotype in the population, did peak at the optimal migration rate. We thus conclude that in structured, asexual populations intermediate migration rates allow for optimal exploration of multiple, distinct fitness peaks, and thus yield the highest long-term adaptive success.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print97.pdf,"[( 04 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 06 Apr 2014 , 1)]"

This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes,

present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated
mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for
the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability,
gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we
develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the

Tests on simulated genomic data suggest that this approach effectively targets atypically distributed genes that are highly likely to be HGT-derived, and exhibits robust performance compared to conventional BLAST-based approaches. This method was further tested on real genomic datasets, including Rickettsia genomes, and was compared to previous studies.

We use a dataset of 22 mitochondrial and nuclear markers from 92% of species in the tribe to re-examine the phylogeny of Heliconiini with both supermatrix and multi-species coalescent approaches, characterise the patterns of conflicting signal and compare the performance of various methodological approaches to reflect the heterogeneity across the data. Despite the large extent of reticulate signal and strong conflict between markers, nearly identical topologies are consistently recovered by most of the analyses, although the supermatrix approach fails to reflect the underlying variation in the history of individual loci. The first comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny of this group is used to test the hypotheses of a diversification rate increase driven by the dramatic environmental changes in the Amazonia over the past 23 million years, or changes caused by diversity-dependent effects on the rate of diversification. We find that the tribe Heliconiini had doubled its rate of speciation around 11 Ma and that the presently most speciose genus Heliconius started diversifying rapidly at 10 Ma, likely in response to the recent drastic changes in topography of the region.

However, manipulation may conflict with the fitness interests of the manipulated individuals. Manipulated individuals can then be favored to resist manipulation, possibly reducing or eliminating the manipulated behavior in the long run. I use a mathematical model to show that conflicts where manipulation and resistance coevolve can disappear as a result of the coevolutionary process. I find that while manipulated individuals are selected to resist, they can simultaneously be favored to express the manipulated behavior at higher efficiency (i.e., providing increasing fitness effects to recipients of the manipulated behavior). Efficiency can increase to a point at which selection for resistance disappears. This process yields an efficient social behavior that is induced by social partners, and over which the inducing and induced individuals are no longer in conflict. A necessary factor is costly inefficiency. I develop the model to address the evolution of advanced eusociality via maternal manipulation (AEMM). The model predicts AEMM to be particularly likely in taxa with ancestrally imperfect resistance to maternal manipulation. Costly inefficiency occurs if the cost of delayed dispersal is larger than the benefit of exploiting the maternal patch. I discuss broader implications of the process.

During training, the birds learned quickly to avoid air puffs by escaping the aversive song within 2 sec. They escaped significantly more aversive songs than socially reinforced ones, and this effect grew stronger with the number of training sessions.

This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another in one-shot interactions gives no direct or indirect benefits to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The ""norm psychology"" hypothesis holds that a player's choice of strategy
reflects socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms that are successful in their particular society. The ""mismatch"" hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter-gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these preferences are misapplied in modern laboratory settings. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well-known model of the mismatch hypothesis and show that selection for one-shot cooperation in the model is an artifact of agents being constrained to only two strategies: Tit-for-Tat and Always Defect. Allowing for repentant and forgiving strategies reverses selection away from one-shot cooperation under
all environmental parameters. Direct reciprocity does not necessarily lead
to cooperation, but instead generates many different normative equilibria depending on a group's idiosyncratic evolutionary history. Therefore, an agent whose behavior is evoked solely from non-cultural environmental cues
will be disadvantaged relative to an agent who learns the locally successful norms. Cooperation in one-shot laboratory experiments is thus more easily explained as the result of a psychology evolved for learning social norms than as a genetic mismatch.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolution and Human Behavior/Evolution and Human Behavior1.pdf,"[( 12 Apr 2014 , 1)]"

Using tethered chromatin conformation capture (TCC) sequencing we determined global three-dimensional chromatin structures in mouse embryonic stem (ES) and neural stem (NS) cell derivatives.

Mapping of promoter-enhancer interactions in pluripotent and differentiated cells revealed that spatial proximity without enhancer element activity is a common architectural feature in cells undergoing early developmental changes.

Circulating cell free fetal DNA has enabled non-invasive prenatal fetal aneuploidy testing without direct discrimination of the genetically distinct maternal and fetal DNA. Current testing may be improved by specifically enriching the sample material for fetal DNA.  DNA methylation may allow for such a separation of DNA and thus support additional clinical opportunities; however, this depends on knowledge of the methylomes of ccf DNA and its cellular contributors. 
Results
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed on a set of unmatched samples including ccf DNA from 8 non-pregnant (NP) and 7 pregnant female donors and genomic DNA from 7 maternal buffy coat and 5 placenta samples.  We found CpG cytosines within longer fragments were more likely to be methylated, linking DNA methylation and fragment size in ccf DNA.  Comparison of the methylomes of placenta and NP ccf DNA revealed many of the 51,259 identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were located in domains exhibiting consistent placenta hypomethylation across millions of consecutive bases, regions we termed placenta hypomethylated domains (PHDs). We found PHDs were consistently located within regions exhibiting low CpG and gene density.  DMRs identified when comparing placenta to NP ccf DNA were recapitulated in pregnant ccf DNA, confirming the ability to detect differential methylation in ccf DNA mixtures.
Conclusions
We generated methylome maps for four sample types at single base resolution, identified a link between DNA methylation and fragment length in ccf DNA, identified DMRs between sample groups, and uncovered the presence of megabase-size placenta hypomethylated domains.  Furthermore, we anticipate these results to provide a foundation to which future studies using discriminatory DNA methylation may be compared.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Biology/Genome Biology3.pdf,"[( 11 Apr 2014 , 1)]"

Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzymatic inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation.

"April 9, 2014",Building realistic assemblages with a Joint Species Distribution Model,Pre print,"[(Harris, David J.,  UC Davis)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/003947 ,"1. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict how individual species---and whole assemblages of species---will respond to a changing environment. Until now, these models have either assumed (1) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated, or (2) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modeling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties.

2. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network,  called mistnet, which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike recently proposed Joint SDMs, mistnet can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors.

3. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were nearly 50,000 times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species models.

4. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analyzing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured---and perhaps unanticipated---environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, mistnet identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of incomplete data sets to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print102.pdf,"[( 11 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 01 May 2014 , 6), ( 23 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 25 Mar 2015 , 1), ( 27 Mar 2015 , 2), ( 21 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 10 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 21 Sep 2014 , 4), ( 19 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 01 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 24 Apr 2014 , 5), ( 23 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 08 May 2014 , 1), ( 13 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 22 Jul 2014 , 15), ( 05 Jan 2015 , 4), ( 20 May 2014 , 3), ( 15 Aug 2014 , 6), ( 15 Apr 2014 , 3), ( 16 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 07 May 2014 , 4), ( 09 Apr 2014 , 12), ( 09 May 2014 , 1)]"

We find that young mammalian duplicates are often functionally conserved, and that functional divergence gradually increases with evolutionary distance between species. Examination of expression patterns in genes with conserved and new functions supports the ?out-of-testes? hypothesis, in which new genes arise with testis-specific functions and acquire functions in other tissues over time.

Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic relatedness, and synergy interact in non-trivial ways that cannot be easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment.  We demonstrate the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within and between species.

One way of introducing such non-linearities into evolutionary games is by the inclusion of multiple players. An example is of social dilemmas, where group benefits could e.g. increase less than linear with the number of cooperators. Such multiplayer games can be introduced in all the fields where evolutionary game theory is already well established. 
However, the inclusion of non-linearities can help to advance the analysis of systems which are known to be complex, e.g. in the case of non-Mendelian inheritance. We review the diachronic theory and applications of multiplayer evolutionary games and present the current state of the field.
Our aim is a summary of the theoretical results from well-mixed populations in infinite as well as finite populations. We also discuss examples from three fields where the theory has been successfully applied, ecology, social sciences and population genetics. In closing, we probe certain future directions which can be explored using the complexity of multiplayer games while preserving the promise of simplicity of evolutionary games.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Dynamic Games and Applications/Dynamic Games and Applications1.pdf,"[( 12 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 07 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 15 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 09 Dec 2014 , 1), ( 16 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 13 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 25 Nov 2014 , 7)]"

In proteins, the average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formula. To investigate oxidation-reduction (redox) patterns, groups of proteins from different subcellular locations and phylogenetic divisions were selected for comparison. Extracellular proteins of yeast have a relatively high oxidation state of carbon, corresponding with oxidizing conditions outside of the cell. However, an inverse relationship between ZC and redox potential occurs between the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm; this trend is interpreted as resulting from overall coupling of protein turnover to the formation of a lower glutathione redox potential in the cytoplasm. In Rubisco homologues, lower ZC tends to occur in organisms with higher optimal growth temperature, and there are broad changes in ZC in whole-genome protein compositions in microbes from different environments. Energetic costs calculated from thermodynamic models suggest that thermophilic organisms exhibit molecular adaptation to not only high temperature but also the reducing nature of many hydrothermal fluids.

What is the relevance of considering this generative process in the study of evolution? How can we study its evolutionary consequences? Despite an historical systematic bias towards linear causation schemes in biology; in the post-genomic era, a systems-view to biology based on nonlinear (network) thinking is increasingly being adopted. Within this view, evolutionary dynamics can be studied using simple dynamical models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Through the study of GRN dynamics, genotypes and phenotypes can be unambiguously defined. The orchestrating role of GRNs constitutes an operational {\em non-linear} genotype-phenotype map. Further extension of these GRN models in order to explore and characterize an associated Epigenetic Landscape enables the study of the evolutionary consequences of both genetic and non-genetic sources of phenotypic variation within the same coherent theoretical framework.

In this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for DNase-seq data analysis (F-seq, Hotspot, MACS and ZINBA) are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published DNase-seq datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from ENCODE in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this ENCODE-derived reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms.
Our study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the ChIP-seq oriented method, MACS, both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder ZINBA appears to be less sensitive than the other three.

Here we develop a reversible-jump Bayesian method of fitting multi-optima OU models to phylogenetic comparative data that estimates the placement and magnitude of adaptive shifts directly from the data. We show how biologically informed hypotheses can be tested against this inferred posterior of shift locations using Bayes Factors to establish whether our a priori models adequately describe the dynamics of adaptive peak shifts. Furthermore, we show how the inclusion of informative priors can be used to restrict models to biologically realistic parameter space and test particular biological interpretations of evolutionary models.

Since it is possible to associate a broad class of cognitive processes with 'dual' information sources, many pathologies can be addressed using statistical models based on the Shannon Coding, the Shannon-McMillan Source Coding, the Rate Distortion, and the Data Rate Theorems, as these impose powerful necessary condition constraints on information generation and exchange, and on system control. Deterministic-but-for-error biological codes do not directly invoke cognition, although they may be essential subcomponents within larger cognitive processes. A formal argument, however, places such codes within a similar framework, with metabolic free energy serving as a 'control signal' stabilizing biochemical code-and-translator dynamics in the presence of noise. Demand beyond available energy supply then expresses itself in punctuated destabilization of the coding channel, affecting a spectrum of essential biological functions. Aging, normal or prematurely driven by psychosocial or environmental stressors, must eventually interfere with the routine operation of such mechanisms, triggering chronic diseases associated with senescence. Amyloid fibril formation, intrinsically disordered protein logic gates, and cell surface glycan/lectin 'kelp bed' logic gates are reviewed from this perspective.

Both type III effector proteins and non-ribosomal peptide toxins play important roles for Pseudomonas syringae pathogenicity in host plants, but whether and how these virulence pathways interact to promote infection remains unclear. Genomic evidence from one clade of P. syringae suggests a tradeoff between the total number of type III effector proteins and presence of syringomycin, syringopeptin, and syringolin A toxins.  Here we report the complete genome sequence from P. syringae CC1557, which contains the lowest number of known type III effectors to date and has also acquired genes similar to sequences encoding syringomycin pathways from other strains. We demonstrate that this strain is pathogenic on Nicotiana benthamiana and that both the type III secretion system and a new type III effector family, hopBJ1, contribute to virulence. We further demonstrate that virulence activity of HopBJ1 is dependent on similar catalytic sites as the E. coli CNF1 toxin. Taken together, our results provide additional support for a negative correlation between type III effector repertoires and the potential to produce syringomycin-like toxins while also highlighting how genomic synteny and bioinformatics can be used to identify and characterize novel virulence proteins.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print108.pdf,"[( 24 Nov 2013 , 6), ( 06 May 2014 , 3), ( 11 Dec 2013 , 2), ( 22 Apr 2014 , 3), ( 05 May 2014 , 2), ( 23 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 02 Dec 2013 , 1), ( 17 Feb 2014 , 3), ( 25 Nov 2013 , 1), ( 12 Dec 2013 , 1), ( 23 Nov 2013 , 1)]"

We develop a method for network reconstruction based on compressive sensing, which takes advantage of the network's sparseness.

Results: For the case in which all genes are accessible for measurement, and there is no measurement noise, we show that our method can be used to exactly reconstruct the network. For the more general problem, in which hidden genes exist and all measurements are contaminated by noise, we show that our method leads to reliable reconstruction.

For this potential to be realized, we need a suitable representation to turn data into insight. 
Since a wide range of experiments and the (unknown) complexity of underlying system make biological data more heterogeneous than those in other fields, we propose the method based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which is well suited for extracting principal components where we have corrupted observations. The proposed method provides us a new representation of these data sets which consists of its common and aberrant response. This representation might help users to acquire a new insight from data. %For example, identifying common event-related neural features across many experimental trials can be used as a signature to detect discrete events or state transitions. Also, the proposed method can be useful to biologists in clustering and analyzing gene expression time series data with a new perspective, for example, it can not only extract canonical cell signaling response but also inform them to get insight into the heterogeneity of different responses across different cell lines.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE21.pdf,"[( 24 Apr 2014 , 2)]"

Population genetic theory predicts that soft sweeps should be likely if the product of the population size and the mutation rate towards the adaptive allele is sufficiently large, such that multiple adaptive mutations can establish before one has reached fixation; however, it remains unclear how demographic processes affect the probability of observing soft sweeps. Here we extend the theory of soft selective sweeps to realistic demographic scenarios that allow for changes in population size over time. We first show that population bottlenecks can lead to the removal of all but one adaptive lineage from an initially soft selective sweep. The parameter regime under which such 'hardening' of soft selective sweeps is likely is determined by a simple heuristic condition. We further develop a generalized analytical framework, based on an extension of the coalescent process, for calculating the probability of soft sweeps under arbitrary demographic scenarios. Two important limits emerge within this analytical framework: In the limit where population size fluctuations are fast compared to the duration of the sweep, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the harmonic mean of the variance effective population size estimated over the duration of the sweep; in the opposing slow fluctuation limit, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the instantaneous variance effective population size at the onset of the sweep. We show that as a consequence of this finding the probability of observing soft sweeps becomes a function of the strength of selection. Specifically, in species with sharply fluctuating population size, strong selection is more likely to produce soft sweeps than weak selection. Our results highlight the importance of accurate demographic estimates over short evolutionary timescales for understanding the population genetics of adaptation from de novo mutation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics4.pdf,"[( 25 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 24 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 23 Apr 2014 , 2)]"

By tuning the rates at which variability is produced, such as the rates of recombination, mutation or migration, populations may increase their long-term adaptability. Here we use theoretical models to gain insight into how the rates of these three evolutionary forces are shaped by fluctuating selection.

Despite being empirically challenging to estimate, there are enough published estimates of G and β to allow for synthesis of general patterns across species. We use published estimates to test the hypotheses that there are systematic differences in the rate of evolution among trait types, and that these differences are in part due to genetic architecture. We find evidence that sexually selected traits exhibit faster rates of evolution compared to life-history or morphological traits. This difference does not appear to be related to stronger selection on sexually selected traits.

The D-statistic (a.k.a. the ABBA/BABA test) was proposed to infer introgression in the presence of ILS for a four-taxon clade.  However, the original D-statistic cannot be directly applied to a symmetric five-taxon phylogeny, and the direction of introgression cannot be inferred for any tree topology.

The DFOIL statistics are shown to overcome this deficiency and to correctly determine the direction of introgressions. The DFOIL tests are relatively simple and computationally inexpensive to calculate, and can be easily applied to various phylogenomic datasets.

We parameterized CTA learning in difopein- YFP transgenic mice, which have widespread by expression of the artificial peptide difopein in the forebrain, including the basolateral amygdala and insular cortex, resulting in functional knock-out (FKO) of all 14-3-3 isoforms . We found that a single pairing of saccharin or NaCl (CS) and LiCl injection (US) was not sufficient to induce CTA in FKO mice. Multiples pairings of CS and US did lead to CTA acquisition in the FKO mice; however, the CTA rapidly extinguished within 30 minutes to 24 hours after acquisition. Additionally, we found that 14-3-3 FKO mice have an attenuated visceral neuraxis response to LiCl as measured by c-Fos induction. The deficit in FKO was not due to an inability to discriminate or avoid tastants, because they showed normal unconditioned taste preferences for both palatable (saccharin, maltodextrin , low concentration NaCl) and unpalatable tastants (quinine, HCl, and high concentration NaCl) and they were able to reduce intake of a maltodextrin solution adulterated with quinine. The FKO did not have a global deficit in ingestive learning, because they were able to form a conditioned flavor-nutrient preference. Thus, FKO of forebrain 14-3-3 appears to disrupt CTA learning leading to forgetting, rapid extinction, or failure to reconsolidate.

Our method builds correlation graphs for publicly available DNase-seq and exon array datasets with matching samples and uses graph-based methods to filter findings supported by multiple datasets and remove indirect interactions.  The resulting set of interactions was validated with both anecdotal information of known long-range interactions and unbiased experimental data deduced from Hi-C and CAGE experiments. Our results provide a novel set of high-confidence candidate open chromatin regions involved in gene regulation, often located several Mb away from the TSS of their target gene.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print121.pdf,"[( 03 May 2014 , 1), ( 29 Apr 2014 , 4)]"

Similar co-enrichment observed in yeast so far has been treated as artifactual, and has not been fully characterized. Here we reanalyze ChIP data from both array-based and sequencing-based experiments to show that in the yeast S. cerevisiae, the collective enrichment phenomenon is strongly associated with proximity to noncoding RNA genes and with nucleosome depletion. DNA sequence motifs that confer binding affinity for the proteins are largely absent from these hotspots, suggesting that protein-protein interactions play a prominent role. The hotspots are condition-specific, suggesting that they reflect a chromatin state or protein state, and are not a static feature of underlying sequence. Additionally, only a subset of all assayed factors is associated with these loci, suggesting that the co-enrichment cannot be simply explained by a chromatin state that is universally more prone to immunoprecipitation. Together our results suggest that the co-enrichment patterns observed in yeast represent transcription factor co-occupancy. More generally, they make clear that great caution must be used when interpreting ChIP enrichment profiles for individual factors in isolation, as they will include factor-specific as well as collective contributions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics6.pdf,"[( 29 Apr 2014 , 4)]"

Much of the recent research in landscape genetics has focused on quantifying the influence of fragmentation on genetic variation among populations, but questions remain as to how habitat loss and configuration influences within-population genetic diversity. Habitat loss and fragmentation might lead to decreases in genetic diversity within populations, which might have implications for population persistence over multiple generations. We used genetic data collected from populations of three species occupying forested landscapes across a broad geographic region: Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli; 22 populations), White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis; 13 populations) and Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea; 19 populations) to quantify patterns of haplotype and nucleotide diversity across a range of forest fragmentation. We predicted that fragmentation effects on genetic diversity would vary depending on dispersal capabilities and habitat specificity of the species. Forest aggregation and the variability in forest patch area were the two strongest landscape predictors of genetic diversity. We found higher haplotype diversity in populations of P. gambeli and S. carolinensis inhabiting landscapes characterized by lower levels of forest fragmentation. Conversely, S. pygmaea demonstrated the opposite pattern of higher genetic diversity in fragmented landscapes. For two of the three species, we found support for the prediction that highly fragmented landscapes sustain genetically less diverse populations. We suggest, however, that future studies should focus on species of varying life-history traits inhabiting independent landscapes to better understand how habitat fragmentation influences within-population genetic diversity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print122.pdf,"[( 08 May 2014 , 1), ( 09 May 2014 , 1)]"

Game theoretic models that seek to predict the most competitive strategy plants use for competition in soil are clear; they generally predict that over-proliferation of roots is the only evolutionarily stable strategy. However, empirical studies are equally clear that not all plants employ this strategy of over-proliferation of roots. Here, our goal was to develop and test an alternative non-game theoretic model that can be used to develop alternative hypotheses for plants that do not appear to play games. 
2.	The model is similar to previous models, but does not use a game theoretic optimization criterion. Instead, plants use only nutrient availability to select a root allocation strategy, ignoring neighbours. To test the model we compare root allocation and seed yield of plants grown either alone or with neighbours. 
3.	The model predicted plants that do not sense neighbours (or ignore neighbours) should allocate roots relative to resource availability following an ideal free distribution. This means that if a soil volume of quality R contains x roots, then a soil volume of quality R/n will contain x/n roots. The experimental data were consistent with this prediction. That is, plants grown with 1.2g of slow release fertilizer resources produced 0.043 g of roots, while plants grown with neighbours, or plants grown with half as much fertilizer produced half as much root mass (0.026g, and 0.24g respectively). Seed yield followed a similar pattern.
4.	This model presents an alternative predictive framework for those plant species that do not seem to play a tragedy of the commons game for belowground competition. 
5.	Synthesis: It remains unclear why some plants do not engage in belowground games for competition. Models suggest over-proliferation is an unbeatable evolutionary stable strategy, yet plants that do not play the game apparently coexist with plants that do. We suggest that a greater understanding of trade-offs among traits that are important for other biotic interactions (above-ground competition, enemy defence, mutualisms) will lead to a greater understanding of why some species over-proliferate roots when in competition but other species do not.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Ecology/Journal of Ecology1.pdf,"[( 08 May 2014 , 3), ( 06 May 2014 , 1)]"

We studied the behavior of the anterior-posterior segmentation network in Drosophila melanogaster embryos depleted of a key maternal input, bicoid (bcd), by building a cellular- resolution gene expression atlas containing measurements of 12 core patterning genes over 6 time points in early development. With this atlas, we determine the precise perturbation each cell experiences, relative to wild type, and observe how these cells assume cell fates in the perturbed embryo. The first zygotic layer of the network, consisting of the gap and terminal genes, is highly robust to perturbation: all combinations of transcription factor expression found in bcd depleted embryos were also found in wild type embryos, suggesting that no new cell fates were created even at this very early stage. All of the gap gene expression patterns in the trunk expand by different amounts, a feature that we were unable to explain using two simple models of the effect of bcd depletion. In the second layer of the network, depletion of bcd led to an excess of cells expressing both even skipped and fushi tarazu early in the blastoderm stage, but by gastrulation this overlap resolved into mutually exclusive stripes. Thus, following depletion of bcd, individual cells rapidly canalize towards normal cell fates in both layers of this gene regulatory network. Our gene expression atlas provides a high resolution picture of a classic perturbation and will enable further modeling of canalization in this transcriptional network.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Development/Development1.pdf,"[( 06 May 2014 , 4), ( 07 May 2014 , 2)]"

Advanced maternal age (AMA) is associated with an increased risk of having a child with ASD for reasons that are not understood.  To explore whether AMA involves covert aneuploidy or epigenetic dysregulation leading to ASD in the offspring, we tested an homogeneous ectodermal cell type from 47 individuals with ASD compared with 48 typically developing (TD) controls born to mothers of ≥35 years, using a quantitative genome-wide DNA methylation assay.  We show that DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in ectodermal cells in these individuals, having accounted for confounding effects due to subject age, sex and ancestral haplotype.  We did not find mosaic aneuploidy or copy number variability to occur at differentially-methylated regions in these subjects.  Of note, the loci with distinctive DNA methylation were found at genes expressed in the brain and encoding protein products significantly enriched for interactions with those produced by known ASD-causing genes, representing a perturbation by epigenomic dysregulation of the same networks compromised by DNA mutational mechanisms.  The results indicate the presence of a mosaic subpopulation of epigenetically-dysregulated, ectodermally-derived cells in subjects with ASD.  The epigenetic dysregulation observed in these ASD subjects born to older mothers may be associated with aging parental gametes, environmental influences during embryogenesis or could be the consequence of mutations of the chromatin regulatory genes increasingly implicated in ASD.

Many studies have demonstrated effects of feedback influences on feedforward driven responses and on behaviour. Also, anatomical projections in both directions have been identified. However, although these studies have revealed the anatomical paths and the neurophysiological consequences of influences in both directions, the neurophysiological mechanisms through which these influences are exerted remain largely elusive. Here we show that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (~4 Hz) and gamma-band (~60-80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band (~14-18 Hz) synchronization. These frequency-specific asymmetries in directed influences were revealed by simultaneous local field potential recordings from eight visual areas and an analysis of Granger-causal influences across all 28 pairs of areas. The asymmetries in directed influences correlated directly with asymmetries in anatomy and enabled us to build a visual cortical hierarchy from the influence asymmetries alone. Across different task periods, most areas stayed at their hierarchical position, whereas particularly frontal areas moved dynamically. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signalling use different frequency channels, which might subserve their differential communication requirements and lead to differential local consequences.

Hybrid dysgenic syndromes represent a form of genomic incompatibility that can arise when transposable element (TE) abundance differs between two parents. When TEs lacking in the female parent are transmitted paternally, a lack of corresponding silencing small RNAs (piRNAs) transmitted through the female germline can lead to TE mobilization in progeny. The epigenetic nature of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the fact that genetically identical females of the reciprocal cross are normal. Here we show that in the hybrid dysgenic syndrome of Drosophila virilis, an excess of paternally inherited TE families leads not only to increased expression of these TEs, but also coincides with derepression of TEs in equal abundance within parents. Moreover, TE derepression is stable as flies age and associated with piRNA biogenesis defects for only some TEs. At the same time, TE activation is associated with a genome wide shift in the distribution of endogenous gene expression and an increase in abundance of off-target genic piRNAs. To identify regions of the maternal genome that most protect against dysgenesis, we performed an F3 backcross analysis. We find that pericentric regions play a dominant role in maternal protection. This F3 backcross approach additionally allowed us to clarify the properties of genic paramutation in D. virilis. Overall, results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of mis-expression that is maintained through adulthood. Such early events in the germline that are mediated by parent-of-origin effects may be important in determining patterns of gene expression in natural populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print126.pdf,"[( 13 May 2014 , 4), ( 14 May 2014 , 3)]"

However, rules for Cas9 targeting specificity are incompletely known.  With increasing numbers of Cas9 systems being developed and deployed in more and more organisms, there is now strong need for a flexible and rational method for finding Cas9 sites with low off-targeting potential.  We address this through the CasFinder system, which we demonstrate by generating human and mouse exome-wide catalogs of specific sites for three varieties of Cas9 - S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus (ST1), and N. meningitidis - that each target 56-74% of all exons.  We also generate reduced sets of up to 3 targets per gene for use in high-throughput Cas9-based gene knockout screens that target 75-80% of all genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print127.pdf,"[( 12 May 2014 , 7), ( 13 May 2014 , 12), ( 28 May 2014 , 3), ( 27 May 2014 , 11), ( 14 May 2014 , 1)]"

We show that CA1 population activity can be described as an evolving traveling wave that exhibits phase coding, rate coding, spike sequences and that generates an emergent population theta rhythm. We identify measures of global remapping and intracellular theta dynamics as critical for distinguishing mechanisms for pacemaking and coordination of sequential population activity.

We first validate the existence of long tan- dem arrays of repeats in maize and other taxa in the genus Zea. Although we find considerable sequence diversity among CentC copies genome-wide, genetic similar- ity among repeats is highest within these arrays, suggesting that tandem duplica- tions are the primary mechanism for the generation of new copies. Genetic clustering analyses identify similar sequences among distant repeats, and simulations suggest that this pattern may be due to homoplasious mutation. Although the two ancestral subgenomes of maize have contributed nearly equal numbers of centromeres, our analysis shows that the vast majority of all CentC repeats derive from one of the parental genomes.

In this study, we collected CORUM module templates to infer respective module families, including 58,041 homologous modules in 1,678 species, and PPI families using searches of complete genomic database. We then derived PPI evolution scores (PPIES) and interface evolution scores (IES) to infer module elements, including core and ring components.

Subsequently, protein dynamics and module dynamics of biological networks and functional diversities confirmed that core components form dynamic biological network hubs and play key roles in various biological functions. PPIES and IES can reflect module organization principles and protein/module dynamics in biological networks. On the basis of the analyses of gene essentiality, module dynamics, network topology, and gene co-expression, the module organizational principles can be described as follows: 1) a module consists of core and ring components; 2) the core components play major roles in biological functions and collaborate with ring components to perform certain functions in some cases; 3) the core components are conserved and essential in module dynamics in time and space.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print128.pdf,"[( 15 May 2014 , 1), ( 12 May 2014 , 1), ( 11 May 2014 , 2)]"

Population genetic studies, however, often ignore BGS effects when investigating demographic events or the presence of other types of selection. To obtain a more realistic evolutionary expectation that incorporates the unavoidable consequences of deleterious mutations, we generated high-resolution landscapes of variation across the Drosophila melanogaster genome under a BGS scenario independent of polymorphism data. We find that BGS plays a significant role in shaping levels of variation across the entire genome, including long introns and intergenic regions distant from annotated genes. We also find that a very large percentage of the observed variation in diversity across autosomes can be explained by BGS alone, up to 70% across individual chromosome arms, thus indicating that BGS predictions can be used as baseline to infer additional types of selection and demographic events. This approach allows detecting several outlier regions with signal of recent adaptive events and selective sweeps. The use of a BGS baseline, however, is particularly appropriate to investigate the presence of balancing selection and our study exposes numerous genomic regions with the predicted signature of higher polymorphism than expected when a BGS context is taken into account. Importantly, we show that these conclusions are robust to the mutation and selection parameters of the BGS model. Finally, analyses of protein evolution together with previous comparisons of genetic maps between Drosophila species, suggest temporally variable recombination landscapes and thus, local BGS effects that may differ between extant and past phases. Because genome-wide BGS and temporal changes in linkage effects can skew approaches to estimate demographic and selective events, future analyses should incorporate BGS predictions and capture local recombination variation across genomes and along lineages.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics4.pdf,"[( 09 May 2014 , 1), ( 10 May 2014 , 2), ( 12 May 2014 , 1)]"

Many amphibian species have little resistance to water loss, which restricts them to moist microhabitats and may significantly affect foraging, dispersal, and courtship. Using plaster models as surrogates for terrestrial plethodontid salamanders, we measured water loss under ecologically-relevant field conditions to estimate the duration of surface activity time across the landscape. Surface activity time was significantly affected by topography, solar exposure, canopy cover, maximum air temperature, and time since rain. Spatially, surface activity times were highest in ravine habitats and lowest on ridges. Surface activity time was a significant predictor of salamander abundance, as well as a predictor of successful recruitment; the probability of a juvenile salamander occupying an area with high surface activity time was two times greater than an area with limited predicted surface activity. Our results suggest that survival, recruitment, or both are demographic processes that are affected by water loss and the ability of salamanders to be surface active. Results from our study extend our understanding of plethodontid salamander ecology, emphasize the limitations imposed by their unique physiology, and highlight the importance of water loss to spatial population dynamics. These findings are timely to understanding the effects that fluctuating temperature and moisture conditions predicted for future climates will have on plethodontid salamanders.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Oecologia/Oecologia1.pdf,"[( 09 May 2014 , 5)]"

We identified 1061 TSSs at an FDR (false discovery rate) of 10% and showed that almost all transcription in M. gallisepticum is initiated from classic TATAAT promoters, which are surrounded by A/T-rich sequences and rarely accompanied by a -35 element. Our analysis revealed the pronounced complexity of the operon structure: on average, each coding operon has one internal TSS and TT in addition to the primary ones. Our new transcriptomic approach based on the intervals between the two closest transcription initiators and/or terminators allowed us to identify two classes of TTs: strong, unregulated and hairpin-containing TTs and weak, heat shock-regulated and hairpinless TTs. Comparing the gene expression levels under different conditions (such as heat, osmotic and peroxide stresses) revealed widespread and divergent transcription regulation in M. gallisepticum.

The acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line OCI-AML3, carrying both NPM1 mutation A and the heterozygous DNMT3A R882C mutation, represents the model for in vitro studies on AML with mutated NPM1. AML with mutated NPM1 harbours a hypo-methylated profile distinct from those of the other AML subtypes. This characteristic is probably related to the inhibitory effect of the mutant DNMT3A on the wild type protein. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a universal methyl donor acting as a coenzyme of DNMT3A. There are growing evidences of the antineoplastic effect of SAM in vitro and in murine models of gastric cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where SAM induces the downregulation of several oncogenes. Moreover SAM upregulates the expression of DNMT enzymes in lung cancer cells. In our knowledge there are no published data exploring the effect of SAM on the growth of OCI-AML3 cells and its ability to modulate DNMT3A activity in this cell line.
Study design and methods. The present data have been generated between August 2013 and April 2014 at the VITROSCREEN facilities in Milan, ITALY.  We used a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess the cytotoxic effect of SAM iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) on OCI-AML3 cells (DSMZ Leibniz Institut). We analyzed then the ability of SAM to induce apoptosis by Tali Image-Based Cytometer (green Annexin V - Alexa Fluor 488 for apoptotic cells, red propidium and green Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 for necrotic cells). 
Results. The MTT assays were performed after having treated the OCI-AML3 cells with various concentrations of the indicated drug for 24 hours. We observed no significant effects on cells viability using 0.5μM, 10 μM and 100 μM of SAM (data not shown). In contrast, a dose dependent cytotoxic effect of SAM on OCI-AML3 cells was evident for concentrations equal or superior to 500 μM, with an IC50 of 500 μM. Since a Cmax of 211(SD 94)μM after single intravenous infusion of SAM was previously reported in healthy voluntarees, we decided to investigate the cytotoxic effect of SAM for concentrations close to 211 μM using the MTT test. A significant dose dependent reduction of the cells viability was observed with SAM 200μM (62,74% viable cells) and SAM 300μM (53.32% viable cells). The Apoptosis assay after 24 hours of treatment with SAM showed no differences in the percentages of apoptotic cells between the OCI-AML3 cells treated with SAM 300,500,2500μM and the untreated cells. After 72 hours, only a minimal effect on the amount of apoptotic cells was obtained, while a clear dose dependent increase in the proportion of dead cells was noted, confirming the results of the aforementioned MTT tests.
Conclusions. SAM showed remarkable in vitro cytotoxic activity on OCI-AML3 cells at concentrations similar to those achievable in humans after intravenous administration. SAM is not able to induce apoptosis of OCI-AML3 cells in vitro after 72 hours of treatment. However, the increase in the amount of dead cells after SAM treatment may be due to mechanisms other than apoptosis. In order to verify if the observed cytotoxicity was mediated by the enzymatic activity of DNMT3A, we planned to repeat the cytotoxicity assays after DNMT3A silencing. The in vivo antineoplastic effect of SAM could be assessed in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with OCI-AML3 cells.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print130.pdf,"[( 12 May 2014 , 1)]"

Best known sources for such discovery have been terrestrial plants and microbes, accounting for about 85% of the approved natural products in pharmaceutical use (1), and about 60% of approved pharmaceuticals and new drug applications annually (2). Discovery in the marine environment has lagged due to the difficulty of exploration in this ecological niche. Exploration began in earnest in the 1950s, after technological advances such as scuba diving allowed collection of marine organisms, primarily at a depth to about 15m.
Natural products from filter feeding marine invertebrates and in particular, sponges, have proven to be a rich source of structurally unique pharmacologically active compounds, with over 16,000 molecules isolated thus far (3, 1) and a continuing pace of discovery at hundreds of novel bioactive molecules per year. All classes of pharmaceuticals have been represented in this discovery process, including antiprotazoals, pesticides, TGF-beta inhibitors, cationic channel blockers, anticancer, cytotoxic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds. Important biosynthetic pathways found in sponges which give rise to these compounds include the terpenoid (4), fatty acid, polyketoid, quinone reductase, alkaloid, isoprenoid (5), and non-ribosomal protein synthase pathways.

Most previous studies have examined predicted off-target binding sites that differ from the perfect target site by one to four mismatches, which represent only a subset of genomic regions. Here, we use ChIP-seq to examine genome-wide CRISPR binding specificity at gRNA-specific and gRNA-independent sites. For two guide RNAs targeting the murine Snurf gene promoter, we observed very high binding specificity at the intended target site while off-target binding was observed at 2- to 6-fold lower intensities. We also identified significant gRNA-independent off-target binding. Interestingly, we found that these regions are highly enriched in the PAM site, a sequence required for target site recognition by CRISPR. To determine the relationship between Cas9 binding and endonuclease activity, we used targeted sequence capture as a high-throughput approach to survey a large number of the potential off-target sites identified by ChIP-seq or computational prediction. A high frequency of indels was observed at both target sites and one off-target site, while no cleavage activity could be detected at other ChIP-bound regions. Our data is consistent with recent finding that most interactions between the CRISPR nuclease complex and genomic PAM sites are transient and do not lead to DNA cleavage.

Novel cellulolytic enzymes have been discovered from microbial genomes and metagenomes of microbial communities. However, the identification of relevant genes without known homologs, and elucidation of the lignocellulolytic pathways and protein complexes for different microorganisms remain a challenge.
 
Results: We describe a new computational method for the targeted discovery of functional modules of plant biomass-degrading protein families based on their co-occurrence patterns across genomes and metagenome datasets, and the strength of association of these modules with the genomes of known degraders. From more than 6.4 million family annotations for 2884 microbial genomes and 332 taxonomic bins from 18 metagenomes, we identified five functional modules that are distinctive for plant biomass degraders, which we call plant biomass degradation modules (PDMs). These modules incorporated protein families involved in the degradation of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins, structural components of the cellulosome and additional families with potential functions in plant biomass degradation. The PDMs could be linked to 81 gene clusters in genomes of known lignocellulose degraders, including previously described clusters of lignocellulolytic genes. On average, 70% of the families of each PDM mapped to gene clusters in known degraders, which served as an additional confirmation of their functional relationships. The presence of a PDM in a genome or taxonomic metagenome bin allowed us to predict an organism's ability for plant biomass degradation accurately. For 15 draft genomes of a cow rumen metagenome, we validated by cross-linking with confirmed cellulolytic enzymes that the PDMs identified plant biomass degraders within a complex microbial community.

Conclusions: Functional modules of protein families that realize different aspects of plant cell wall degradation can be inferred from co-occurrence patterns across (meta-)genomes with a probabilistic topic model. The PDMs represent a new resource of protein families and candidate genes implicated in microbial plant biomass degradation. They can be used to predict the ability to degrade plant biomass for a genome or taxonomic bin.

Genomic studies over the past 5 years have documented differences across populations in the number of heterozygous deleterious genotypes, numbers of homozygous derived deleterious genotypes, number of deleterious segregating sites and proportion of sites that are potentially deleterious. These differences have been attributed to population history affecting the ability of natural selection to remove deleterious variants from the population. However, recent studies have suggested that the genetic load may not differ across populations, and that the efficacy of natural selection has not differed across human populations.

The most striking example may be in colon cancer, where activating KRAS mutations generally indicate a lack of benefit to treatment with EGFR inhibitors, although the activating KRAS G13D mutation appears to be an exception. As KRAS G13D generally shares the same biochemical defects as the other oncogenic KRAS mutants, a mechanism for differential sensitivity is not apparent. Here, a previously developed mathematical model of Ras mutant signaling is used to investigate this problem. The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether differential response is consistent with known mechanisms of Ras signaling, and to determine if any known features of Ras mutants provide an explanation for differential sensitivity. Computational analysis of the mathematical model finds that differential response to upstream inhibition between cancers with different Ras mutants is indeed consistent with known mechanisms of Ras biology. Moreover, model analysis demonstrates that the subtle biochemical differences between G13D and G12D (and G12V) mutants are sufficient to enable differential response to upstream inhibition. Simulations suggest that wild-type Ras within the G13D mutant context is more effectively inhibited by upstream inhibitors than when it is in the G12D or G12V contexts.  This difference is a consequence of an elevated Km for the G13D mutant. The identification of a single parameter that influences sensitivity is significant in that it suggests an approach to evaluate other, less common, Ras mutations for their anticipated response to upstream inhibition.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print139.pdf,"[( 21 May 2014 , 1)]"

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.

Results
Here we present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of > 1000 in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with poly-A and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length and we show IVT is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find ~50% of transcripts have > 2-fold and ~10% have > 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. Strikingly, we also find > 6% of transcripts have regions of high, unpredictable sequencing coverage, where the same transcript varies dramatically in coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. To get at causal factors, we used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show that rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage and that several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.

Conclusions
In sum, these results show the utility of IVT-seq in promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq and suggest caution in its interpretation. Furthermore, we find that rRNA-depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage. Perhaps most importantly, these coverage biases introduced during library preparation suggest exon level expression analysis may be inadvisable.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Biology/Genome Biology4.pdf,"[( 14 Aug 2014 , 13), ( 17 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 25 Jul 2014 , 2), ( 15 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 24 May 2014 , 1), ( 09 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 07 Jun 2014 , 4), ( 29 May 2014 , 1), ( 13 Aug 2014 , 8), ( 23 May 2014 , 6), ( 11 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 21 May 2014 , 13), ( 27 May 2014 , 11), ( 22 May 2014 , 4), ( 08 Jun 2014 , 3)]"

In this study we examine the form of natural selection imposed by mantid predation on wing size and shape in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. We then evolve populations of D. melanogaster under predation pressure, and examine the extent to which wing size and shape have responded in the predicted direction. We demonstrate that wing form partially evolves along the predicted vector from selection, more so than for control lineages. Furthermore, we re-examined phenotypic selection after ~30 generations of experimental evolution. We observed that the magnitude of selection on wing size and shape was diminished in populations evolving with mantid predators, while the direction of the selection vector differed from that of the ancestral population for shape.

Such metabolic oscillations in synchronized cultures reflect single-cell oscillations, but the relationship between the oscillations in single cells and synchronized cultures is poorly understood. To understand this relationship and the coordination between metabolism and cell division, we collected and analyzed DNA-content, gene-expression and physiological data, at hundreds of time-points, from cultures metabolically-synchronized at different growth rates, carbon sources and biomass densities. The data enabled us to extend and generalize our mechanistic model, based on ensemble average over phases (EAP), connecting the population-average gene-expression of asynchronous cultures to the gene-expression dynamics in the single-cells comprising the cultures. The extended model explains the carbon-source specific growth-rate responses of hundreds of genes. Our physiological data demonstrate that the frequency of metabolic cycling in synchronized cultures increases with the biomass density, suggesting that this cycling  is an emergent behavior, resulting from the entraining of the single-cell metabolic cycle by a quorum-sensing mechanism, and thus underscoring the difference between metabolic cycling in single cells and in synchronized cultures. Measurements of constant levels of residual glucose across metabolically synchronized cultures indicate that storage carbohydrates are required to fuel not only the G1/S transition of the division cycle but also the metabolic cycle. Despite the large variation in profiled conditions and in the scale of their dynamics, most genes preserve invariant dynamics of coordination with each other and with the rate of oxygen consumption. Similarly, the G1/S transition always occurs at the beginning, middle or end of the high oxygen consumption phases, analogous to observations in human and drosophila cells.

Existing methods to infer transmission dynamics from sequence data rely on well-characterised infectious periods, epidemiological and clinical meta-data which may not always be available, and typically require computationally intensive analysis focusing on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. We sought to determine whether the topological structures of phylogenetic trees contain signatures of the transmission patterns underlying an outbreak.
Methodology: We use simulated outbreaks to train and then test computational classifiers. We test the method on data from two real-world outbreaks.
Results: We show that different transmission patterns result in quantitatively different phyloge- netic tree shapes. We describe topological features that summarize a phylogenys structure and find that computational classifiers based on these are capable of predicting an outbreaks transmission dynamics. The method is robust to variations in the transmission parameters and network types, and recapitulates known epidemiology of previously characterized real-world outbreaks.
Conclusions: and implications There are simple structural properties of phylogenetic trees which, when combined, can distinguish communicable disease outbreaks with a super-spreader, homogeneous transmission, and chains of transmission. This is possible using genome data alone, and can be done during an outbreak.

RNAseq provides remarkable power in the area of biomarkers discovery and disease stratification. The main technical steps affecting the results of RNAseq experiments are Library Sample Preparation (LSP) and Bioinformatics Analysis (BA). At the best of our knowledge, a comparative evaluation of the combined effect of LSP and BA was never considered and it might represent a valuable knowledge to optimize alternative splicing detection, which is a challenging task due to moderate fold change differences to be detected within a complex isoforms background.
Results
Different LSPs (TruSeq unstranded/stranded, ScriptSeq, NuGEN) allow the detection of a large common set of isoforms. However, each LSP also detects a smaller set of isoforms, which are characterized both by lower coverage and lower FPKM than that observed for the common ones among LSPs. This characteristic is particularly critical in case of low input RNA NuGEN v2 LSP. 
The effect on statistical detection of alternative splicing considering low input LSP (NuGEN v2) with respect to high input LSP (TruSeq) on statistical detection of alternative splicing was studied using a benchmark dataset, in which both synthetic reads and reads generated from high (TruSeq) and low input (NuGEN) LSPs were spiked-in. Statistical detection of alternative splicing (AltDE) was done using prototypes of BA for isoform-reconstruction (Cuffdiff) and exon-level analysis (DEXSeq). Exon-level analysis performs slightly better than isoform-reconstruction approach although at most only 50% of the spiked-in transcripts are detected. Both isoform-reconstruction and exon-level analysis performances improve by rising the number of input reads.
Conclusion
Data, derived from NuGEN v2, are not the ideal input for AltDE, specifically when exon-level approach is used. It is notable that ribosomal depletion, with respect to polyA+ selection, reduces the amount of coding mappable reads resulting detrimental in the case of AltDE. Furthermore, we observed that both isoform-reconstruction and exon-level analysis performances are strongly dependent on the number of input reads.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics4.pdf,"[( 27 May 2014 , 3)]"

In contrast, all three types of CGD mice were highly susceptible to BCG, as witnessed by a severe weight loss, development of hemorrhagic pneumonia, and a high mortality (~ 50%). Rescue of NOX2 activity in macrophages restored BCG resistance, similar as seen in wild-type mice. Granulomas from mycobacteria-infected wild type mice generated ROS, while granulomas from CGD mice did not.

We tested this prediction in two areas where different colour morphs of the mimetic species Heliconius erato and H. melpomene have become established, as well as in the hybrid zone between these morphs.

We did not detect differences in survival between colour morphs, but all morphs were more highly attacked in the hybrid zone.

The uncharacterized complex Hdr/flox-1 (Dde_1207:13) is sometimes important alongside Rnf and may perform an electron bifurcation to generate more reduced ferredoxin from NADH to allow further ion pumping. Similarly, during the oxidation of malate or fumarate, the electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB-2 (Dde_1250:1) is important and may generate reduced ferredoxin to allow additional ion pumping by Rnf.  During formate oxidation, the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase HysAB is required, which suggests that hydrogen forms in the periplasm, diffuses to the cytoplasm, and is used to reduce ferredoxin, thus providing a substrate for Rnf.

One of the most common goals of hierarchical clustering is finding those branches of a tree that form quantifiably distinct data subtypes. Achieving this goal in a statistically meaningful way requires (a) a measure of distinctness of a branch and (b) a test to determine the significance of the observed measure, applicable to all branches and across multiple scales of dissimilarity.
Results
We formulate a method termed Tree Branches Evaluated Statistically for Tightness (TBEST) for identifying significantly distinct tree branches in hierarchical clusters. For each branch of the tree a measure of distinctness, or tightness, is defined as a rational function of heights, both of the branch and of its parent. A statistical procedure is then developed to determine the significance of the observed values of tightness. We test TBEST as a tool for tree-based data partitioning by applying it to five benchmark datasets, one of them synthetic and the other four each from a different area of biology.  For each dataset there is a well-defined partition of the data into classes. In all test cases TBEST performs on par with or better than the existing techniques. 
Conclusions
Based on our benchmark analysis, TBEST is a tool of choice for detection of significantly distinct branches in hierarchical trees grown from biological data.

Molecular evidence for paraphyly is ambiguous: a previously unrecognized signal from spacer sequences favours an alternative root placement that would resolve Osmunda s.l. as monophyletic. Our evolutionary placement analysis identifies fossil species as ancestral members of modern genera and subgenera. Altogether, the seemingly conflicting evidence from morphological, anatomical, molecular, and palaeontological data can be elegantly reconciled under the assumption that Osmunda is indeed monophyletic; the recently proposed root-placement in Osmundaceaebased solely on molecular datalikely results from un- or misinformative out-group signals.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Evolutionary Biology/BMC Evolutionary Biology2.pdf,"[( 24 May 2015 , 1), ( 04 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 05 Jun 2014 , 1)]"

In these experiments, individuals are selected for extreme values of a trait, causing alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to increase or decrease in frequency in the experimental population. We present a new analysis of the power of artificial selection experiments to detect and localize quantitative trait loci. This analysis uses a simulation framework that explicitly models whole genomes of individuals, quantitative traits, and selection based on individual trait values. We find that explicitly modeling QTL provides produces qualitatively different insights than considering independent loci with constant selection coefficients. Specifically, we observe how interference between QTLs under selection impacts the trajectories and lengthens the fixation times of selected alleles. We also show that a substantial portion of the genetic variance of the trait (50100%) can be explained by detected QTLs in as little as 20 generations of selection, depending on the trait architecture and experimental design. Furthermore, we show that power depends crucially on the opportunity for recombination during the experiment.

In an unstructured population, a lineage with selective access to multiple peaks is expected to rapidly fix on one, which may not be the highest peak. Contrarily, beneficial mutations in a population with spatially restricted migration take longer to fix, allowing distant parts of the population to explore the landscape semi-independently. Such a population can simultaneous discover multiple peaks and the genotype at the highest discovered peak is expected to fix eventually. Thus, structured populations sacrifice initial speed of adaptation for breadth of search. As in the Tortoise-Hare fable, the structured population (Tortoise) starts relatively slow, but eventually surpasses the unstructured population (Hare) in average fitness. In contrast, on single-peak landscapes (e.g., systems lacking epistasis), all uphill paths converge. Given such ""smooth"" topography, breadth of search is devalued, and a structured population only lags behind an unstructured population in average fitness (ultimately converging). Thus, the Tortoise-Hare pattern is an indicator of ruggedness. After verifying these predictions in simulated populations where ruggedness is manipulable, we then explore average fitness in metapopulations of Escherichia coli. Consistent with a rugged landscape topography, we find a Tortoise-Hare pattern. Further, we find that structured populations accumulate more mutations, suggesting that distant peaks are higher. This approach can be used to unveil landscape topography in other systems, and we discuss its application for antibiotic resistance, engineering problems, and elements of Wright's Shifting Balance Process.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print149.pdf,"[( 04 Jun 2014 , 4), ( 06 Jun 2014 , 1)]"

We have developed the insertional chromatin immunoprecipitatin (iChIP) technology to isolate specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions and identify their associated molecules. iChIP consists of locus-tagging and affinity purification. The recognition sequences of an exogenous DNA-binding protein such as LexA are inserted into a genomic region of interest in the cell to be analyzed. The exogenous DNA-binding protein fused with a tag(s) is expressed in the cell and the target genomic region is purified with antibody against the tag(s). In this study, we developed the iChIP system using recombinant DNA-binding proteins to make iChIP more straightforward.
Results: In this system, recombinant 3xFNLDD-D (r3xFNLDD-D) consisting of the 3xFLAG-tag, a nuclear localization signal, the DNA-binding domain plus the dimerization domain of the LexA protein, and the Dock-tag is used for isolation of specific genomic regions. 3xFNLDD-D was expressed using a silkworm-baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity purification. iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D could efficiently isolate the single-copy chicken Pax5 (cPax5) locus, in which LexA binding elements were inserted, with negligible contamination of other genomic regions. In addition, we could detect RNA associated with the cPax5 locus using this form of the iChIP system combined with RT-PCR.

The most effective normalization methods depend on the data from multiple patients. From a biomedical perspective this implies that predictions for a single patient may change depending on which other patient samples they are normalized with. This test set bias will occur when any cross-sample normalization is used before clinical prediction.
Methods: We developed a new prediction modeling framework based on the relative ranks of features within a sample in order to prevent the need for cross-sample normalization, therefore effectively avoiding test set bias. We employed modeling with previously published Top-Scoring Pairs (TSPs) methodology to build the rank-based predictors. We further investigated the robustness of the rank-based models in case of heterogeneous datasets using diverse microarray technologies.
Results: We demonstrated that results from existing genetic signatures which rely on normalizing test data may be unreproducible when the patient population changes compo- sition or size.

The identification of apparently conserved gene complements in the venom and salivary glands of a diverse set of reptiles led to the development of the Toxicofera hypothesis  the idea that there was a single, early evolution of the venom system in reptiles. However, this hypothesis is based largely on relatively small scale EST-based studies of only venom or salivary glands and toxic effects have been assigned to only some of these putative Toxcoferan toxins in some species. We set out to investigate the distribution of these putative venom toxin transcripts in order to investigate to what extent conservation of gene complements may reflect a bias in previous sampling efforts.  
Results
We have carried out the first large-scale test of the Toxicofera hypothesis and found it lacking in a number of regards. Our quantitative transcriptomic analyses of venom and salivary glands and other body tissues in five species of reptile, together with the use of available RNA-Seq datasets for additional species shows that the majority of genes used to support the establishment and expansion of the Toxicofera are in fact expressed in multiple body tissues and most likely represent general maintenance or housekeeping genes. The apparent conservation of gene complements across the Toxicofera therefore reflects an artefact of incomplete tissue sampling. In other cases, the identification of a non-toxic paralog of a gene encoding a true venom toxin has led to confusion about the phylogenetic distribution of that venom component.
Conclusions
Venom has evolved multiple times in reptiles. In addition, the misunderstanding regarding what constitutes a toxic venom component, together with the misidentification of genes and the classification of identical or near-identical sequences as distinct genes has led to an overestimation of the complexity of reptile venoms in general, and snake venom in particular, with implications for our understanding of (and development of treatments to counter) the molecules responsible for the physiological consequences of snakebite.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Toxicon/Toxicon1.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2014 , 3), ( 18 Jun 2014 , 3), ( 06 Jun 2014 , 4)]"

Understanding the evolution of the vertebrate pancreas is key to understanding its functions. The chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays) have been suggested to possess the most ancient example of a distinct pancreas with both hormonal (endocrine) and digestive (exocrine) roles, although the lack of genetic, genomic and transcriptomic data for cartilaginous fish has hindered a more thorough understanding of the molecular-level functions of the chondrichthyan pancreas, particularly with respect to their unusual energy metabolism (where ketone bodies and amino acids are the main oxidative fuel source) and their paradoxical ability to both maintain stable blood glucose levels and tolerate extensive periods of hypoglycemia. In order to shed light on some of these processes we have carried out the first large-scale comparative transcriptomic survey of multiple cartilaginous fish tissues: the pancreas, brain and liver of the lesser spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula.
Results
We generated a mutli-tissue assembly comprising 86,006 contigs, of which 44,794 were assigned to a particular tissue or combination of tissue based on mapping of sequencing reads. We have characterised transcripts encoding genes involved in insulin regulation, glucose sensing, transcriptional regulation, signaling and digestion, as well as many peptide hormone precursors and their receptors for the first time. Comparisons to published mammalian pancreas transcriptomes reveals that mechanisms of glucose sensing and insulin regulation used to establish and maintain a stable internal environment are conserved across jawed vertebrates and likely pre-date the vertebrate radiation.  Conservation of pancreatic hormones and genes encoding digestive proteins support the single, early evolution of a distinct pancreatic gland with endocrine and exocrine functions in vertebrates, although the peptide diversity of the early vertebrate pancreas has been overestimated as a result of the use of cross-reacting antisera in earlier studies. A three hormone islet organ is therefore the basal vertebrate condition, later elaborated upon only in the tetrapod lineage.

environmental conditions, so the identification of active miRNAs in a given sample is of great interest. Here we 
present a novel computational approach for analyzing both mRNA sequence and gene expression data, called 
MixMir. Our method corrects for 3' UTR background sequence similarity between transcripts, which is known to 
correlate with mRNA transcript abundance. We demonstrate that after accounting for kmer sequence similarities 
in 3' UTRs, a statistical linear model based on motif presence/absence can effectively discover active miRNAs in 
a sample. MixMir utilizes fast software implementations for solving mixed linear models which are widely-used in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Essentially we use 3' UTR sequence similarity in place of population 
cryptic relatedness in the GWAS problem. Compared to similar methods such as miREDUCE, Sylamer and 
cWords, we found that MixMir performed better at discovering true miRNA motifs in Dicer knockout CD4+ T-cells,

To address this question, we have reconstructed the fitness landscape describing the adaptation of Tobacco etch potyvirus to its new host, Arabidopsis thaliana.  Fitness was measured for most of the genotypes in the landscape, showing the existence of peaks and holes.  We found prevailing epistatic effects between mutations, with cases of reciprocal sign epistasis being common at latter stages.  Therefore, results suggest that the landscape was rugged and holey, with several local fitness peaks and a very limited number of potential neutral paths.

I have previously shown that such high-throughput experiments can be combined with knowledge of underlying mutation rates to create a parameter-free evolutionary model that describes the phylogeny of influenza nucleoprotein far better than commonly used existing models. Here I extend this work by showing that published experimental data on TEM-1 beta-lactamase (Firnberg et al, 2014) can be combined with a few mutation rate parameters to create an evolutionary model that describes beta-lactamase phylogenies much than most common existing models.

Here, we develop an approximation to the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in humans. Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this score to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence. We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively selected or neutral across various categories, including different types of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms is bimodal, with a neutral peak and a second peak at s ≈ −10^(−4).

These systems are often prone to abrupt and unexpected instabilities and state shifts that emerge as a discontinuous response to gradual changes in environmental drivers. Predicting such behaviours is crucial to the prevention of or  preparation for unwanted regime shifts. Recent research in ecology has investigated early warning signs that anticipate the divergence of univariate ecosystem dynamics from a stable attractor. To date, leading indicators of instability in systems with multiple interacting  components have remained poorly investigated. This is a major limitation in the understanding of the dynamics of complex social-ecological networks. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to demonstrate that rising variance ? measured, for example, by the maximum element of the covariance matrix of the network ? is an effective leading indicator of network instability. We show that its reliability and robustness depend more on the sign of the interactions within the network than the network structure or noise intensity. Mutualistic, scale free and small world networks are less stable than their antagonistic or random counterparts but their instability is more reliably predicted by this leading indicator.

Although this transition is ubiquitous, relatively little is known about how the shift from a transcriptionally quiescent to transcriptionally active genome is controlled. We describe here the genome-wide distributions and temporal dynamics of nucleosomes and post-translational histone modifications through the maternal-to-zygotic transition in embryos of the pomace fly Drosophila melanogaster. At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 11, but it is not until cycle 13 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown are bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda. Most of these Zelda-bound regions are destined to be enhancers or promoters active during mitotic cycle 14, and our data demonstrate that they are biochemically distinct long before they become active, raising the possibility that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences. Many of these Zelda-associated active regions occur in larger domains that we find strongly enriched for histone marks characteristic of Polycomb-mediated repression, suggesting a dynamic balance between Zelda activation and Polycomb repression. Collectively, these data paint a complex picture of a genome in transition from a quiescent to an active state, and highlight the role of Zelda in mediating this transition.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife8.pdf,"[( 14 Jun 2014 , 2), ( 16 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 13 Jun 2014 , 7)]"

Gene- and pathway-based association tests are increasingly being viewed as useful complements to the more widely used single marker association analysis which have successfully uncovered numerous disease variants. A major drawback of single-marker based methods is that they do not consider pairwise and higher-order interactions between genetic variants. Here, we describe novel tests for multi-marker association analyses that are based on phenotype predictions obtained from machine learning algorithms. Instead of utilizing only a linear or logistic regression model, we propose the use of ensembles of diverse machine learning algorithms for constructing such association tests. As the true mathematical relationship between a phenotype and any group of genetic and clinical variables is unknown in advance and may be complex, such a strategy gives us a general and flexible framework to approximate this relationship across different sets of SNPs. We show how phenotype prediction obtained from ensemble learning algorithms can be used for constructing tests for the joint association of multiple variants.

Genetic variation in sex chromosomes and ratios of quantities computed from sex chromosomes and autosomes have often been examined in order to infer patterns of sex-biased admixture, typically using statistical approaches that do not mechanistically model the complexity of a sex-specific history of admixture.  Here, expanding on a model of Verdu \& Rosenberg (2011) that did not include sex specificity, we develop a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories.  Under the model, multiple source populations contribute to an admixed population, potentially with their male and female contributions varying over time. In an admixed population descended from two source groups, we derive the moments of the distribution of the autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population as a function of sex-specific introgression parameters and time. Considering admixture processes that are constant in time, we demonstrate that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosomal admixture is informative about sex bias. Specifically, the long-term variance decreases as the sex bias from a contributing source population increases. This result can be viewed as analogous to the reduction in effective population size for populations with an unequal number of breeding males and females. Our approach can contribute to methods for inference of the history of complex sex-biased admixture processes by enabling consideration of the effect of sex-biased admixture on autosomal DNA.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics6.pdf,"[( 24 Jun 2014 , 3)]"

In particular, networks based on transcript data and protein-protein interactions have been used to design therapies that employ drug combinations. But there has been less focus on employing human genetic interaction networks constructed from copy number alterations (CNAs). These networks can be charted with sensitivity and precision by seeking gene pairs that tend to be amplified and/or deleted in tandem, even when they are located at a distance on the genome. Our experience with radiation hybrid (RH) panels, a library of cell clones that have been used for genetic mapping, have shown this tool can pinpoint statistically significant patterns of co-inherited gene pairs. In fact, we were able to identify gene pairs specifically associated with the mechanism of cell survival at single gene resolution. The strategy of seeking correlated CNAs can also be used to map survival networks for cancer. Although the cancer networks have lower resolution, the RH network can be leveraged to provide single gene specificity in the tumor networks. In a survival network for glioblastoma possessing single gene resolution, we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene interacted with 46 genes. Of these genes, ten (22%) happened to be targets for existing drugs. Here, we briefly review the previous use of molecular networks to design novel therapies.

This way, we can assess the contributions of both known and unknown decay and aggregation processes for maintaining levels of gene product on a gene-by-gene basis. In this extended protocol, drug treatments that target specific cellular functions (termed mechanism disruption) can be used in tandem with mRNA extraction from the polysome to look at the dynamics of mRNA levels associated with transcription and translation at multiple stages during a physiological perturbation. This is accomplished through validating the polysome isolation method in human cells and comparing fractions of mRNA for each experimental treatment at multiple points in time. First, three different drug treatments corresponding to the arrest of various cellular processes are administered to populations of human cells. For each treatment, the transcriptome and translatome are compared directly at different time points by assaying both cell-type specific and non-specific genes. There are two findings of note. First, extraction of mRNA from the polysome and comparison with the transcriptome can yield interesting information about the regulation of cellular mRNA during a functional challenge to the cell. In addition, the conventional application of such drugs to assess mRNA decay is an incomplete picture of how severely challenged or senescent cells regulate mRNA in response.

Patterns of neural tissue-specific AS have been identified, often regulated by neuron-specific splicing factors that are essential for survival, demonstrating the importance of AS in neurons. In vitro studies of neuronal activity found AS changes in response to neuronal activity in addition to transcriptional ones, raising the question of whether such changes are recapitulated in vivo on behaviorally relevant timescales. We developed a paradigm for studying physiological neuronal activity through controlled stimulation of the olfactory bulb, and performed RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of olfactory bulbs from odor-deprived and stimulated mice. We found that physiological stimulation induces large, rapid and reproducible changes in transcription in vivo, and that the activation of a core set of activity-regulated factors is recapitulated in an in vitro model of neuronal stimulation. However, physiological activity did not induce global changes in post-transcriptional mRNA processing, such as AS or alternative cleavage and polyadenylation.

In theory, if one knows the number of strands in the β-barrel, then the 3D structure of the barrel could be trivial, but current topology predictions do not predict accurate structures and are unable to give information beyond the β-strands in the barrel. Recent work has shown successful prediction of globular and alpha-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments, by using high ranked evolutionary couplings between residues as distance constraints to fold extended polypeptides. However, these methods, have not addressed the calculation of precise β-sheet hydrogen bonding that defines transmembrane β-barrels, and would be required to fold these proteins successfully.

Our approach offers a new direction by sitting between pure reference-based compression and reference-free compression and combines much of the benefit of reference-based approaches with the flexibility of de novo encoding.  Our method, called path encoding, draws a connection between storing paths in de Bruijn graphs --- a common task in genome assembly --- and context-dependent arithmetic coding. Supporting this method is a system, called a bit tree, to compactly store sets of kmers that is of independent interest. Using these techniques, we are able to encode RNA-seq reads using 3% -- 11% of the space of the sequence in raw FASTA files, which is on average more than 34% smaller than recent competing approaches.

However, standard population genetic inference procedures do not account for sampling serially over time, and new methods are needed to make full use of modern experimental evolution data. To address this problem, we develop a Gaussian process approximation to the multi-locus Wright-Fisher process with selection over a time course of tens of generations. The mean and covariance structure of the Gaussian process are obtained by computing the corresponding moments in discrete-time Wright-Fisher models conditioned on the presence of a linked selected site. This enables our method to account for the effects of linkage and selection, both along the genome and across sampled time points, in an approximate but principled manner. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the power of our method to correctly detect, locate and estimate the fitness of a selected allele from among several linked sites. We also study how this power changes for different values of selection strength, initial haplotypic diversity, population size, sampling frequency, experimental duration, number of replicates, and sequencing coverage depth. In addition to providing quantitative estimates of selection parameters from experimental evolution data, our model can be used by practitioners to design E&R experiments with requisite power.

We demonstrate that the predictions from the branching process model fit very well with Wright-Fisher forward simulations and backwards simulations under a modified Kingman coalescent, and further show that estimates of the effective founder size are robust to possibly confounding factors such as migration between subpopulations.

These so-called subclonal populations are defined by distinct somatic mutations that include point mutations such as single nucleotide variants and small indels ? collectively called simple somatic mutations (SSMs) ? as well as larger structural changes that result in copy number variations (CNVs). In some cases, the genotype and prevalence of these subpopulations can be reconstructed based on high-throughput, short-read sequencing of DNA in one or more tumor samples. To date, no automated SSM-based subclonal reconstructions have been attempted on WGS data; and CNV-based reconstructions are limited to tumors with two or fewer cancerous subclonal populations and with a small number of CNVs.

We describe a new automated method, PhyloWGS, that can be applied to WGS data from one or more tumor samples to perform subclonal reconstruction based on both CNVs and SSMs. PhyloWGS successfully recovers the composition of mixtures of a highly rearranged TGCA cell line when a CNV-based method fails. On WGS data with average read depth of 40 from five time-series chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, PhyloWGS recovers the same tumor phylogeny previously reconstructed using deep targeted resequencing.  To further explore the limits of WGS-based subclonal reconstruction, we ran PhyloWGS on simulated data: PhyloWGS can reliably reconstruct as many as three cancerous subpopulations based on 30-50x coverage WGS data from a single tumor sample with 10?s to 1000?s of SSMs per subpopulation. At least five cancerous subpopulations can be reconstructed if provided with read depths of 200 or more. 

PhyloWGS is the first automated method that can be applied to WGS tumor data  that accurately reconstructs the frequency, genotype and phylogeny of the subclonal populations based on both SSMs and CNVs. It also provides a principled, automated approach to combining overlapping SSM and CNV data.

We first investigate whether alternative splicing isoform changes are predictive of tumors by applying a rank-based algorithm based on the reversal of the relative expression of transcript isoforms. We find that consistent alternative splicing isoform changes can separate with high accuracy tumor and normal samples, as well as some cancer subtypes. We then searched for those changes that occur in the most abundant isoform, i.e isoform switches, and are therefore more likely to have a functional impact. In total we detected 244 isoform switches, which are associated to functional pathways that are frequently altered in cancer and also separate tumor and normal samples accurately. We further assessed whether these isoform changes are associated to somatic mutations. Surprisingly, only a few cases appear to have association, including the putative tumor suppressor FBLN2 and the tumor driver MYH11, which show association of an isoform switch to mutations and indels on the alternatively spliced exon. However, the number of observed mutations is in general not sufficient to explain the frequency of the found isoform switches, suggesting that recurrent isoform switching in cancer is mostly independent of somatic mutations. In summary, we present an effective approach to detect novel alternative splicing signatures that are predictive of tumors. Moreover, the same methodology has led to uncover recurrent isoform switches in tumors, which may provide novel prognostic and therapeutic targets.

We demonstrate that as the number of sperm cells in an aggregate increase, the group moves with more persistent linearity but without increasing speed; this benefit, however, is offset in larger aggregates as the geometry of the group forces sperm to swim against one another. The result is a non-monotonic relationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a theoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of 6-7 sperm/aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driving these sperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating systems and find that sperm of P. maniculatus (highly promiscuous), which have evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more often than sperm of P. polionotus (strictly monogamous), which lack competition.

Although increasing the length of sequence reads and library fragments can help overcome these problems, even the longest available reads do not resolve all regions of the human genome. In order to overcome the issue of allelic diversity, we used genomic DNA from an essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1.

When a cell is strongly perturbed by an environmental stimulus, it can either die or persist with compensatory changes. But what do the dynamics of individual genes look like during this process of adaptation? In a previous technical paper, two approaches (drug treatments and polysome isolation) were used in tandem to demonstrate the effects of perturbation on cellular phenotype. In this paper, we can use these data in tandem with a discrete, first-order feedback model that incorporates leaky components to better characterize adaptive responses of mRNA regulation related to information processing in the cell. By evaluating the dynamic relationship between mRNA associated with transcription (translatome) and mRNA associated with the polysome (transcriptome) at multiple timepoints, hypothetical conditions for decay and aggregation are found and discussed. Our feedback model allows for the approximation of fluctuations and other aspects of cellular information processing, in addition to the derivation of three information processing principles.

During the initial period of differentiation, cells exit from pluripotency and enter an Epi-like state. Following this transient stage, and under the influence of Activin/Nodal and BMP signalling, cells face a fate choice between differentiating into neuroectoderm and contributing to Primitive Streak fates. We find that Wnt signalling does not suppress neural development as previously thought and that it aids both fates in a context dependent manner. Our results suggest that as cells exit pluripotency they are endowed with a primary neuroectodermal fate and that the potency to become endomesodermal rises with time.

A frequently observed variant is predicted to cause the substitution of a lysine with a glutamic acid at position 700 of the protein (K700E). However, the molecular consequences of the mutations are largely unknown. Results: To start exploring this question, we sequenced the transcriptomes of six samples: four samples of CLL tumour cells, of which two contained the K700E mutation in SF3B1, and CD19 positive cells from two healthy donors. We identified 41 genes that showed differential usage of exons statistically associated with the mutated status of SF3B1 (false discovery rate of 10%).

As one of the genetic mechanisms for adaptive immunity, V(D)J recombination generates an enormous repertoire of T-cell receptors (TCRs). With the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, systematic exploration of V(D)J recombination becomes possible. Multiplex PCR method has been previously developed to assay immune repertoire, however the usage of primer pools has inherent bias in target amplification. In our study, we developed a ligation-anchored PCR method to unbiasedly amplify the repertoire. 
Results
By utilizing a universal primer paired with a single primer targeting the conserved constant region, we amplified TCR-beta (TRB) variable regions from total RNA extracted from blood. Next-generation sequencing libraries were then prepared for Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer, which provided 151 bp read length to cover the entire V(D)J recombination region. We evaluated this approach on blood samples from patients with malignant and benign meningiomas. Mapping of sequencing data showed 64% to 91% of mapped TCRV-containing reads belong to TRB subtype. An increased usage of TRBV29-1 was observed in malignant meningiomas. Also distinct signatures were identified from CDR3 sequence logos, with predominant subset as 42 nt for benign and 45 nt for malignant samples, respectively.

We also examined the relationship between mycoplasma contamination and host gene expression in a single cell RNA-seq dataset and found 61 host genes (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with mycoplasma-mapped read counts.

Policy-makers increasingly demand robust measures of biodiversity change over short time periods.

By contrast, opportunistic biological records are relatively unstructured but vast in quantity. Recently, these data have been applied to increasingly elaborate science and policy questions, using a range of methods. At present we lack a firm understanding of which methods, if any, are capable of delivering unbiased trend estimates on policy-relevant timescales.
2.	We identified a set of candidate methods that employ either selection criteria or correction factors to deal with variation in recorder activity. We designed a computer simulation to compare the statistical properties of these methods under a suite of realistic data collection scenarios. We measured the Type I error rates of each method-scenario combination, as well as the power to detect genuine trends.
3.	We found that simple methods produce biased trend estimates, and/or had low power. Most methods are robust to variation in sampling effort, but biases in spatial coverage, sampling effort per visit, and detectability, as well as turnover in community composition all induced some methods to fail. No method was robust to all forms of variation in recorder activity.
4.	We warn against the use of simple methods. We identify three methods with complementary strengths and weaknesses that are useful for estimating timely trends. Sophisticated correction factor methods, including Occupancy and Frescalo, offer the greatest potential in the long-term.

We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments.  To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks.  These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells.  We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle.  We find that the cell cycle explains only 5%-17% of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology5.pdf,[]

In this study, we investigated the genomic impact of a selective event of this kind in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. Through linkage mapping we first identified a genomic region that was necessary for males to survive Wolbachia-induced killing. We then investigated the genomic impact of the rapid spread of suppression that converted the Samoan population of this butterfly from a 100:1 female-biased sex ratio in 2001, to a 1:1 sex ratio by 2006. Models of this process revealed the potential for a chromosome-wide selective sweep. To measure the impact directly, the pattern of genetic variation before and after the episode of selection was compared. Significant changes in allele frequencies were observed over a 25cM region surrounding the suppressor locus, alongside generation of linkage disequilibrium. The presence of novel allelic variants in 2006 suggests that the suppressor was introduced via immigration rather than through de novo mutation. In addition, further sampling in 2010 indicated that many of the introduced variants were lost or had reduced in frequency since 2006. We hypothesise that this loss may have resulted from a period of purifying selection - removing deleterious material that introgressed during the initial sweep.

RNA sequencing enables allele specific expression (ASE) studies that complement standard genotype expression studies for common variants and, importantly, also allow measuring the regulatory impact of rare variants. The Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) is collecting RNA-seq data on multiple tissues of a same set of individuals and novel methods are required for the analysis of these data.

Results:
We present a statistical method to compare different patterns of ASE

impact on the tissue-wide expression profile. We focus on strong ASE effects that we are expecting to see for protein-truncating variants, but our method can also be adjusted for other types of ASE effects.
We illustrate the method with a real data example on a tissue-wide expression profile of a variant causal for lipoid proteinosis, and with a simulation study to assess our method more generally.

Backgrounds defined by single deletions of metabolically active enzymes induce strong rewiring when the deletion corresponds to a catabolic gene, evidencing a broad redistribution of fluxes to alternative pathways. We also show how change is more pronounced in interactions linking genes in distinct functional modules, and in those connections that present weak epistasis. These patterns reflect overall the distributed robustness of catabolism. In a second class of genetic backgrounds, in which a number of neutral mutations accumulate, we dominantly observe modifications in the negative interactions that together with an increase in the number of essential genes indicate a global reduction in buffering. Notably, neutral trajectories that originate considerable changes in the wild-type network comprise mutations that diminished the environmental plasticity of the corresponding metabolism, what emphasizes a mechanistic integration of genetic and environmental buffering.

assess the accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by
different analysis pipelines.  The results show that i) overall there
is a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by the
best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the error in
the estimated gene expression values can vary considerably across

Most cis effects were additive irrespective of their effect sizes, consistent with a hypothesis that they represent rate-limiting factors in transcript accumulation.

Short IBD segments convey information about events far back in time because the shorter IBD segments are, the older they are assumed to be. The identification of short IBD segments becomes possible through next generation sequencing (NGS), which offers high variant density and reports variants of all frequencies. However, only recently HapFABIA has been proposed as the first method for detecting very short IBD segments in NGS data. HapFABIA utilizes rare variants to identify IBD segments with a low false discovery rate.

We applied HapFABIA to the 1000 Genomes Project whole genome sequencing data to identify IBD segments that are shared within and between populations. Many IBD segments have to be old since they are shared with Neandertals or Denisovans, which explains their shorter lengths compared to segments that are not shared with these ancient genomes. The Denisova genome most prominently matches IBD segments that are shared by Asians. Many of these segments were found exclusively in Asians and they are longer than segments shared between other continental populations and the Denisova genome. Therefore, we could confirm an introgression from Deniosvans into ancestors of Asians after their migration out of Africa. While Neandertal-matching IBD segments are most often shared by Asians, Europeans share a considerably higher percentage of IBD segments with Neandertals compared to other populations, too. Again, many of these Neandertal-matching IBD segments are found exclusively in Asians, whereas Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Europeans are often found in other populations, too. Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Asians or Europeans are longer than those observed in Africans. These IBD segments hint at a gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans after they left Africa. Interestingly, many Neandertal- and/or Denisova-matching IBD segments are predominantly observed in Africans - some of them even exclusively. IBD segments shared between Africans and Neandertals or Denisovans are strikingly short, therefore we assume that they are very old. Consequently, we conclude that DNA regions from ancestors of humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans have survived in Africans. As expected, IBD segments on chromosome X are on average longer than IBD segments on the autosomes. Neandertal-matching IBD segments on chromosome X confirm gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans outside Africa that was already found on the autosomes.

Exposure of endothelial cells to non-specific toxins or other physical stresses induces death by traditional apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms, common to most different types of cells. In contrast, exposure of endothelial cells (but not other types of nucleated cells) to specific insults, such as oxidized pathogenic lipids (e.g. 7-ketocholesterol) or agents with known anti-angiogenic activity (e.g. bevacizumab, certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etc.) triggers cell death via a novel pathway, which involves the formation of massively calcified endosomes, which, in turn, escape from the dying endothelial cells as massively calcified exosomes. These endosomes/exosomes appear capable of provoking an inflammatory response, characterized by physical association of calcified microparticles with inflammatory cells (monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils) with resulting increased release of an inflammatory mediator (TNF) into the culture medium. Traditional media for the culture of endothelial cells are profoundly inhibitory to MCED, as are some mammalian sera and many human sera, explaining why MCED had not been previously discovered and reported. The present discovery of MCED was accidental, resulting from work with primary cultures of fresh human tumor cell clusters, which invariably contain microcapillary cells Our culture media are optimized for the tumor cells and not for the endothelial cells and, thus, are permissive of MCED.

Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.

Availability and implementation: Poretools is open source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code and user documentation are freely available in Github at https://github.com/arq5x/poretools

It is generally unclear what circuit mechanisms can inherently facilitate robustness in the dynamics to variations in temperature. Here, we address this issue using a combination of mathematical models and experimental measurements in a cell-free transcription-translation system. We find that negative transcriptional feedback can reduce the effect of temperature variation on circuit dynamics. Further, we find that effective negative feedback due to first-order degradation mechanisms can also enable such a temperature robustness effect. Finally, we estimate temperature dependence of key parameters mediating such negative feedback mechanisms.

It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Oikos/Oikos1.pdf,"[( 03 Jan 2014 , 4), ( 11 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 09 Jan 2014 , 2), ( 28 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 04 Jan 2014 , 2), ( 16 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 14 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 07 May 2014 , 5), ( 15 Feb 2014 , 1), ( 06 Jan 2014 , 3), ( 22 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 09 May 2014 , 1), ( 14 Mar 2014 , 2)]"

Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility), packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on 9 non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous variants of those proteins, where available. We obtained measures of variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1 to 0.4). Moreover, we found that buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation than was structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than was buriedness or packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than are more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of homologous structures, or computational protein design.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Molecular Evolution/Journal of Molecular Evolution2.pdf,"[( 26 Apr 2014 , 1), ( 01 Nov 2014 , 1), ( 22 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 25 Apr 2014 , 2), ( 24 Apr 2014 , 1)]"

One female trait that is commonly proposed to influence male mate choice is the exaggerated estrous swelling displayed by females of many Old World primate species. The reliable indicator hypothesis posits that females use the exaggerated swellings to compete for access to mates by advertising variation in female fitness. We tested the two main predictions of this hypothesis in a wild population of baboons (Papio cynocephalus). First, we examined the effect of swelling size on the probability of mate-guarding ('consortship') by the highest-ranking male and the behavior of those males that trailed consorshipts ('follower males'). Second, we asked whether a female's swelling size predicted several fitness measures. We found that high-ranking males do not prefer females with larger swellings (when controlling for cycle number and conception) and that females with larger swellings did not have higher reproductive success. In doing so, we have tested and rejected the reliable indicator hypothesis for the function of exaggerated swellings in cercopithecine primates. Furthermore, we found unambiguous evidence that males biased their mating decisions in favor of females who had experienced more sexual cycles since their most recent pregnancy.

However, how natural selection might evolve such precise regulation from an initial state without regulation, is rarely discussed. In addition, the accuracy of gene regulation is affected by noise in gene expression [1]. Expression noise varies greatly across genes [2?5], suggesting that natural selection has affected noise levels, but the role of expression noise in gene regulation is currently poorly understood [6]. Here we present a combination of experimental evidence and theoretical modeling showing that the transmission of expression noise from regulators to their targets can function as a rudimentary form of gene regulation that facilitates the evolution of more finely tuned gene regulation. 
To assess how natural selection has affected transcriptional noise in E. coli, we evolved a large set of synthetic promoters under carefully controlled selective conditions and found, surprisingly, that native E. coli promoters show no signs of having been selected for minimizing their noise. Instead, a subset of native promoters, which are characterized by high expression plasticity and high numbers of regulatory inputs, show elevated noise levels. A general theoretical model, which recognizes that target genes are not only affected by the condition-dependent activities of their regulators, but also by the regulators? noise, explains these observations. Noise transmission from regulators to their targets is favored by selection whenever regulation is imprecise, and may even constitute the main function of coupling a promoter to a regulator. Our theory provides a novel framework for understanding the evolution of gene regulation, demonstrating that in many situations expression noise is not the mere unwanted side-effect of regulatory interactions, but a beneficial function that is key to the evolvability of regulatory interactions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife11.pdf,"[( 15 Apr 2015 , 4), ( 16 Apr 2015 , 1), ( 06 Aug 2014 , 3), ( 09 Jun 2015 , 1), ( 22 Oct 2014 , 2), ( 22 Jul 2014 , 2), ( 18 Jul 2014 , 9)]"

Experimental findings suggest neurons of the vertical system are strongly electrically coupled, and that several downstream neurons driving motor responses to ego-rotation receive inputs primarily from a small subset of VS  cells. These downstream neurons must decode information about the axis of rotation from a partial readout of the VS population response. To investigate the role of coupling, we simulated the VS response to a variety of rotating visual scenes and
computed optimal Bayesian estimates  from the  relevant subset of VS cells. Our analysis shows that coupling leads to near-optimal estimates from a subpopulation readout.
In contrast, coupling between VS cells has no impact on the quality of encoding in the response of the full population.

Current biomedical research needs to leverage and exploit the large amount of information reported in publications. Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and their associated diseases.  

Results
By exploiting morpho-syntactic information of the text BeFree is able to identify gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations with state-of-the-art performance. The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications.
Conclusions
BeFree is a novel  text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources, raising several issues on data prioritization and curation.

The most popular way of detecting communities algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity.  When optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph ensemble that acts as a null model.  The communities are then the sets of nodes that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the null model.  Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under study.  In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the radiation model of population spread.  We also develop novel synthetic spatial benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard (``Newman-Girvan'') null model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model.

These include microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). These RNAs can be discovered, annotated, and quantified using small RNA-seq, a variant RNA-seq method based on highly parallel sequencing. Alignment to a reference genome is a critical step in analysis of small RNA-seq data. Because of their small size (20-30 nts depending on the organism and sub-type) and tendency to originate from multi-gene families or repetitive regions, reads that align equally well to more than one genomic location are very common. Typical methods to deal with multi-mapped small RNA-seq reads sacrifice either precision or sensitivity. The tool 'butter' balances precision and sensitivity by placing multi-mapped reads using an iterative approach, where the decision between possible locations is dictated by the local densities of more confidently aligned reads. Butter displays superior performance relative to other small RNA-seq aligners. Treatment of multi-mapped small RNA-seq reads has substantial impacts on downstream analyses, including quantification of MIRNA paralogs, and discovery of endogenous siRNA loci.

A key feature of these models is that these novel phenotypes ecologically isolate hybrid populations from parental populations, precipitating speciation.  Here we present an alternative model of the evolution of reproductive isolation in hybrid populations that occurs as a simple consequence of selection against incompatibilities. Unlike previous models, our model does not require small population sizes, the availability of new niches for hybrids or ecological or sexual selection on hybrid traits. We show that reproductive isolation between hybrids and parents evolves frequently and rapidly under this model, even in the presence of ongoing migration with parental species and strong selection against hybrids.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful technique for transcriptome profiling of the organisms that uses the capabilities of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Recent advances in NGS let to measure the expression levels of tens to thousands of transcripts simultaneously. Using such information, developing expression-based classification algorithms is an emerging powerful method for diagnosis, disease classification and monitoring at molecular level, as well as providing potential markers of disease. Here, we present the bagging support vector machines (bagSVM), a machine learning approach and bagged ensembles of support vector machines (SVM), for classification of RNA-Seq data. The bagSVM basically uses bootstrap technique and trains each single SVM separately; next it combines the results of each SVM model using majority-voting technique.
Results
We demonstrate the performance of the bagSVM on simulated and real datasets. Simulated datasets are generated from negative binomial distribution under different scenarios and real datasets are obtained from publicly available resources. A deseq normalization and variance stabilizing transformation (vst) were applied to all datasets. We compared the results with several classifiers including Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA), single SVM, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forests (RF). In slightly overdispersed data, all methods, except CART algorithm, performed well. Performance of PLDA seemed to be best and RF as second best for very slightly and substantially overdispersed datasets. While data become more spread, bagSVM turned out to be the best classifier. In overall results, bagSVM and PLDA had the highest accuracies.
Conclusions
According to our results, bagSVM algorithm after vst transformation can be a good choice of classifier for RNA-Seq datasets mostly for overdispersed ones. Thus, we recommend researchers to use bagSVM algorithm for the purpose of classification of RNA-Seq data. PLDA algorithm should be a method of choice for slight and moderately overdispersed datasets.

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are highly mutable genetic elements that often reside in functional genomic regions. The cumulative evidence of genetic studies on individual STRs suggests that STR variation profoundly affects phenotype and contributes to trait heritability. Despite recent advances in sequencing technology, STR variation has remained largely inaccessible across many individuals compared to single nucleotide variation or copy number variation. STR genotyping with short-read sequence data is confounded by (1) the difficulty of uniquely mapping short, low-complexity reads and (2) the high rate of STR amplification stutter. Here, we present MIPSTR, a robust, scalable, and affordable method that addresses these challenges. MIPSTR uses targeted capture of STR loci by single-molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPs) and a unique mapping strategy. Targeted capture and mapping strategy resolve the first challenge; the use of single molecule information resolves the second challenge. Unlike previous methods, MIPSTR is capable of distinguishing technical error due to amplification stutter from somatic STR mutations. In proof-of-principle experiments, we use MIPSTR to determine germ-line STR genotypes for 102 STR loci with high accuracy across diverse populations of the plant A. thaliana. We show that putatively functional STRs may be identified by deviation from predicted STR variation and by association with quantitative phenotypes. Employing DNA mixing experiments and a mutant deficient in DNA repair, we demonstrate that MIPSTR can detect low-frequency somatic STR variants. MIPSTR is applicable to any organism with a high-quality reference genome and is scalable to genotyping many thousands of STR loci in thousands of individuals.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print197.pdf,"[( 28 Jul 2014 , 3), ( 10 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 23 Sep 2014 , 5)]"

While much work has been done to elucidate the topologies of individual networks in isolation, understanding of inter-network regulatory mechanisms remains limited. This shortcoming is of particular relevance to synthetic biology. Synthetic biological circuits tend to lose their engineered functionality over generational time, primarily due to the deleterious stress that they exert on their host organisms. To reduce this stress (and thus minimize loss of functionality) synthetic circuits must be sensitive to the health of the host organism. Development of integrated regulatory systems is therefore essential to robust synthetic biological systems. The aim of this study was to develop integrated gene-regulatory and metabolic networks which self-optimize in response to varying environmental conditions. We performed \emph{in silico} evolution to develop such networks using a two-step approach: (1) We optimized metabolic networks given a constrained amount of available enzyme. Here, we found that a proportional relationship between flux control coefficients and enzyme mass holds in all linear sub-networks of branched networks, except those sub-networks which contain allosteric regulators. Network optimization was performed by iteratively redistributing enzyme until flux through the network was maximized. Optimization was performed for a range of boundary metabolite conditions to develop a profile of optimal enzyme distributions as a function of environmental conditions.

The objective of the gene regulatory networks was to produce the optimal distribution of metabolic network enzymes given specific boundary metabolite conditions of the target network.

Some propose that the high mutation rates of STRs in functional genomic regions facilitate evolutionary adaptation. Despite their high mutation rate, some STRs show little to no variation in populations. One such STR occurs in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene PFT1 (MED25), where it encodes an interrupted polyglutamine tract. Though the PFT1 STR is large (~270 bp), and thus expected to be extremely variable, it shows only minuscule variation across A. thaliana strains. We hypothesized that the PFT1 STR is under selective constraint, due to previously undescribed roles in PFT1 function. We investigated this hypothesis using plants expressing transgenic PFT1 constructs with either an endogenous STR or with synthetic STRs of varying length. Transgenic plants carrying the endogenous PFT1 STR generally performed best across adult PFT1-dependent traits. In stark contrast, transgenic plants carrying a PFT1 transgene lacking the STR entirely phenocopied a pft1 loss-of-function mutant for flowering time phenotypes, and were generally hypomorphic for other traits, establishing the functional importance of this domain. Transgenic plants carrying various synthetic constructs occupied the phenotypic space between wild-type and pft1-loss-of-function mutants. By varying PFT1 STR length, we discovered that PFT1 can act as either an activator or repressor of flowering in a photoperiod-dependent manner. We conclude that the PFT1 STR is constrained to its approximate wild-type length by its various functional requirements.

If true, Hsp90 clients should show increased evolutionary rate compared to non-clients; however, other factors, such as gene expression and protein connectivity, may confound or obscure the chaperone's putative contribution. Here, we compared the evolutionary rates of many Hsp90 clients and non-clients in the human protein kinase superfamily. We show that Hsp90 client status promotes evolutionary rate independently of, but in a similar magnitude to, gene expression and protein connectivity. Hsp90's effect on kinase evolutionary rate was detected across mammals, specifically relaxing purifying selection. Hsp90 clients also showed increased nucleotide diversity and harbored more damaging variation than non-client kinases across humans. These results are consistent with the central argument of the capacitor hypothesis that interaction with the chaperone allows its clients to harbor genetic variation. Hsp90 client status is thought to be highly dynamic with as few as one amino acid change rendering a protein dependent on the chaperone. Contrary to this expectation, we found that across protein kinase phylogeny Hsp90 client status tends to be gained, maintained, and shared among closely related kinases.

In this assay the histone mark of interest is enriched through a chromatin pull-down assay using an antibody for the mark. Due to imperfect antibodies and other factors, many of the sequenced fragments do not originate from the histone mark of interest, and are referred to as background reads. Background reads are not uniformly distributed and therefore control samples are usually used to estimate the background distribution at any given genomic position. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium guidelines suggest sequencing a whole cell extract (WCE, or ""input"") sample, or a mock ChIP reaction such as an IgG control, as a background sample. However, for a histone modification ChIP-seq investigation it is also possible to use a Histone H3 (H3) pull-down to map the underlying distribution of histones.

In this paper we generated data from a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell population isolated from mouse foetal liver to compare WCE and H3 ChIP-seq as control samples. The quality of the control samples is estimated by a comparison to pull-downs of histone modifications and to expression data. We find minor differences between WCE and H3 ChIP-seq, such as coverage in mitochondria and behaviour close to transcription start sites. Where the two controls differ, the H3 pull-down is generally more similar to the ChIP-seq of histone modifications.

This area is biogeographically interesting because several similar floristic differentiation patterns have been proposed, all of which are primarily explained by two historical barriers, the Tokara Tectonic Strait (Tokara Gap) and the Kerama Gap, which arose during the formation of the islands. We calculated floristic dissimilarity distance among 26 islands based on data sets for three dispersal-ability classes. Clustering analyses based on the floristic dissimilarity distance generated similar floristic patterns regardless of dispersal-ability class. We propose that because the landscape resistance is so strong that migration of plants is severely restricted regardless of their dispersal abilities, the similar floristic differentiation patterns are generated. Multivariate regression analyses using Mantel's randomization test indicated that floristic differentiations among islands were explained by the both effects of the historical barriers and geographic distance in all dispersal-ability classes.

The degree of overlapping in the spatial distribution of trees among layers in these two forests suggested that trees in the upper two layers in the Ishigaki forest can catch sufficient light, while light can not penetrate easily to the lower three layers in both of the forests. As a result, almost species in the lower layers might be shade-tolerant in both of the forests.

Motivation:
Mate pair protocols add to the utility of paired-end sequencing by boosting the genomic distance spanned by each pair of reads, potentially allowing larger repeats to be bridged and resolved. The Illumina Nextera Mate Pair (NMP) protocol employs a circularisation-based strategy that leaves behind 38bp adapter sequences which must be computationally removed from the data. While ""adapter trimming"" is a well-studied area of bioinformatics, existing tools do not fully exploit the particular properties of NMP data and discard more data than is necessary.

Results: 
We present NxTrim, a tool that strives to discard as little sequence as possible from NMP reads. The sequence either side of the adapter site is triaged into ""virtual libraries"" of mate pairs, paired-end reads and single-ended reads.

Gene action may be additive, producing fitness functions that are linear in the number of cooperators in a group, or not. Assuming weak selection, we obtain the following two contrasting conclusions.

This is partly due to fluctuations in neuromodulatory input from regions such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem. LC activity changes with arousal and modulates sensory processing, cognition and memory. The main olfactory bulb (MOB) is richly targeted by LC fibers and noradrenaline profoundly influences MOB circuitry and odor-guided behavior. Noradrenaline-dependent plasticity affects the output of the MOB. However, it is unclear whether noradrenergic plasticity includes modulation in the glomerular layer, the site of input to the MOB. Noradrenergic terminals are found in the glomerular layer, but noradrenaline receptor activation does not seem to acutely modulate olfactory sensory neuron terminals in vitro. We investigated whether noradrenaline induces plasticity at the glomerulus. We used wide-field optical imaging to measure changes in odor responses following electrical stimulation of locus coeruleus in anesthetized mice. Surprisingly, the odor-evoked intrinsic optical signals at the glomerulus were persistently weakened after LC activation. Calcium imaging selectively from olfactory sensory neurons confirmed that this effect was due to a uniform gain suppression of presynaptic input, and did not require exposure to a stimulus during the LC activation. Finally, noradrenaline antagonists prevented glomerular suppression. We conclude that noradrenaline release from LC has persistent effects on odor processing already at the first synapse of the main olfactory system.

Recent studies have revealed widespread associations between genetic variation and methylation levels. However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at ~300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10%) 11,752 methylation QTLs (meQTLs)--i.e., loci in which genetic variation is associated with changes in DNA methylation. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes. One plausible driver of coordinated changes in different regulatory mechanisms is variation in transcription factor (TF) binding. Indeed, we found that SNPs that change predicted TF binding affinities are significantly enriched for associations with DNA methylation at nearby CpGs. Taken together, our observations are consistent with a model whereby changes in TF binding may frequently drive coordinated changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene expression levels.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics10.pdf,"[( 15 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 15 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 13 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 12 Jun 2014 , 21), ( 11 Jun 2014 , 10), ( 16 Jun 2014 , 3)]"

We tested the newly proposed model by applying it to 104 protein-coding genes in brewer's yeast, and compared the fit of the new model to the standard M0 model and to the mutation-selection model of Yang and Nielsen (2008) using the AIC. Our new model provided significantly better fit in approximately 85% of the cases considered for the basic M0 model and in approximately 25% of the cases for the M0 model with estimated codon frequencies, but only in a few cases when the mutation-selection model was considered. However, our model includes a parameter that can be interpreted as a measure of the rate of protein production, and the estimates of this parameter were highly correlated with an independent measure of protein production for the yeast genes considered here.

While the function of this phenomenon is unclear, it may help organisms navigate on solid phases, such as soil. The origin of this behavior is also unknown: it may be biological (that is, dependent on components that sense the environment and regulate growth accordingly) or merely physical.

Here we show that B. subtilis, an organism that typically does not respond to media compression, can be induced to do so with two simple and synergistic perturbations: a mutation that maintains cells in the swarming (chained) state, and the addition of EDTA to the growth media, which further increases chain length. EDTA apparently increases cell length by inducing defects in cell separation, as the treatment has only marginal effects on the length of individual cells. 

These results lead us to three conclusions. First, the wealth of genetic tools available to B. subtilis will provide a new, tractable chassis for engineering compression sensitive organisms. Second, the sensitivity of colony morphology to media compression in Bacillus is a physical rather than biological phenomenon dependent on a simple physical property of rod-shaped cells. And third, colony morphology under compression holds promise as a rapid, simple, and low-cost way to screen for changes in the length of rod-shaped cells or chains thereof.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PeerJ/PeerJ3.pdf,"[( 11 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 08 Aug 2014 , 6)]"

Very high correlations between this factor and phenotypic IQ, educational achievement were observed (r>0.9 and 0.8), also after partialling out GDP and the Human Development Index. Regression analysis was used to estimate a genotypic (predicted) IQ also for populations with missing data for phenotypic IQ. Socio-economic indicators (GDP and Human Development Index) failed to predict residuals, not providing evidence for the effects of environmental factors on intelligence.
Another analysis revealed that the relationship between IQ and the genotypic factor was not mediated by race, implying that it exists at a finer resolution, a finding which in turn suggests selective pressures postdating sub-continental population splits.
Genotypic height and IQ were inversely correlated but this correlation was mostly mediated by race. In at least two cases (Native Americans vs East Asians and Africans vs Papuans) genetic distance inferred from evolutionarily neutral genetic markers contrasts markedly with the resemblance observed for IQ and height increasing alleles. 
A principal component analysis on a random sample of 20 SNPs revealed two factors representing genetic relatedness due to migrations. However, the correlation between IQ and the intelligence PC was not mediated by them. In fact, the intelligence PC emerged as an even stronger predictor of IQ after entering the ""migratory"" PCs in a regression, indicating that it represents selection pressure instead of migrational effects.

We tested how miniature radio-tags affected flight performance and behavior of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), possibly the smallest bird species to be fitted with radio-tags. Using eyelash adhesive, we fitted hatch year individuals (n=20 males and 15 females) with faux radio-tags of three sizes varying in mass and antenna length (220mg-12.7cm, 240mg-12.7cm, and 220mg-6.35cm), then filmed the birds in a field aviary to quantify activity budgets. We also estimated flight range using flight simulation models. When the three radio-tag packages were pooled for analysis, the presence of a radio-tag significantly decreased both flight time (-8%) and modeled flight range (-23%) when compared to control birds. However, a multiple comparison analysis between the different packages revealed that there was a significant difference in flight time when the larger radio-tag package (240mg) was attached and no significant difference in flight time when the lighter radio-tag packages (220mg) were attached. Our results are similar to other studies which analyzed the flight time or flight range of birds wearing radio-tags. Therefore, currently available light weight radio-tags (≤220mg) may be a new option to aid in the study of hummingbird biology. Future study should focus upon the additional drag created by the radio-tag and the effects of the lightest radio-tag packages on free ranging birds.

In the last ten years, many methods have been proposed to use the variance in the gene histories to estimate species trees by explicitly modeling deep coalescence. However, gene flow, another process that may produce gene history variance, has been less studied. In this paper, we propose a simple yet innovative method for species trees estimation in the presence of gene flow. Our method, called STEST (Species Tree Estimation from Speciation Times), constructs species tree estimates from pairwise speciation time or species divergence time estimates. By using methods that estimate speciation times in the presence of gene flow, (for example, M1 (Yang 2010) or SIM3s (Zhu and Yang 2012)), STEST is able to estimate species trees from data subject to gene flow. We develop two methods, called STEST (M1) and STEST (SIM3s), for this purpose. Additionally, we consider the method STEST (M0), which instead uses the M0 method (Yang 2002), a coalescent-based method that does not assume gene flow, to estimate speciation times. It is therefore devised to estimate species trees in the absence of gene flow. Our simulation studies show that STEST (M0) outperforms STEST(M1), STEST (SIM3s) and STEM in terms of estimation accuracy and outperfroms *BEAST in terms of running time when the degree of gene flow is small. STEST (M1) outperforms STEST (M0), STEST (SIM3s), STEM and *BEAST in term of estimation accuracy when the degree of gene flow is large.

Reflectance spectrometry has become a standard colour-measuring tool, especially after the discovery of tetrachromacy in birds and their ability to detect UV. Birds? plumage patterns may be invisible to humans, necessitating a reliable and objective way of assessing colouration not dependent on human vision. Plumage colouration measurements can be taken directly on live birds in the field or in the lab (e.g. on collected feathers). Therefore, it is essential to determine which sampling method yields more repeatable and reliable measures, and which of the available quantitative approaches best assess the repeatability of these measures. Using a spectrophotometer, we measured melanin-based colouration in barn swallows? (Hirundo rustica) plumage. We assessed the repeatability of measures obtained with both traditional sampling methods separately to quantitatively determine their reliability. We used the ANOVA-based method for calculating the repeatability of measurements from two years separately, and the GLMM-based method to calculate overall adjusted repeatabilities for both years. We repeated the assessment for the whole reflectance spectrum range and only the human-visible part, to assess the influence of the UV component on the reliabilities of sampling methodologies. Our results reveal very high repeatability for lab measurements and a lower, still moderate to high repeatability, for field measurements. Both increased when limited to only the human-visible part, for all plumage patches except the throat, where we observed the opposite trend. Repeatability between sampling methods was quite low including the whole spectrum, but moderate including only the human-visible part. Our results suggest higher reliability for measurements in the lab and higher power and accuracy of the GLMM-based method.

Body fluid identification by mRNA profiling may allow extraction of contextual 'activity level' information from forensic samples. Here we describe the development of a prototype multiplex digital gene expression (DGE) method for forensic body fluid/tissue identification based upon solution hybridization of color-coded NanoString® probes to 23 tissue/body fluid specific mRNA targets. The body fluids/tissues targeted were peripheral blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin. We tested and compared a simple 5 minute room temperature cellular lysis protocol against standard RNA isolation from same source material as a means to facilitate ease-of-use in forensic sample processing.
We first describe a model for gene expression in a sample from a single body fluid and then extend that model to mixtures of body fluids.  We then describe calculation of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of body fluid quantities in a sample, and we describe the use of likelihood ratios to test for the presence of each body fluid in a sample.  Known single source blood, semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin samples all demonstrated the expected tissue specific gene expression for at least two of the chosen biomarkers. Saliva samples were more problematic, with their previously identified characteristic genes exhibiting poor specificity. Nonetheless the most specific saliva biomarker, HTN3, was expressed at a higher level in saliva than in any of the other tissues. As a preliminary indication of the ability of the method to discern admixtures of body fluids, five mixtures were prepared. Two of the five mixtures were called perfectly using the assay algorithm, and one of the component fluids was identified in the each of the 'false negative' mixtures.  Crucially, our algorithm produced zero false positive fluid identifications across this study's 98 samples. Further optimization of the biomarker 'Codeset' will be required before it can be used in casework, particularly with respect to increasing the signal to noise ratio of the saliva biomarkers.

To analyze the magnitude of the TE effect on gene expression response to environmental changes, we profiled gene and TE transcript levels in maize seedlings exposed to a number of abiotic stresses. Many genes exhibit up- or down-regulation in response to these stress conditions. The analysis of TE families inserted within upstream regions of up-regulated genes revealed that between four and nine different TE families are associated with up-regulated gene expression in each of these stress conditions, affecting up to 20% of the genes up-regulated in response to abiotic stress and as many as 33% of genes that are only expressed in response to stress. Expression of many of these same TE families also responds to the same stress conditions. The analysis of the stress- induced transcripts and proximity of the transposon to the gene suggests that these TEs may provide local enhancer activities that stimulate stress-responsive gene expression.

Several approaches have been proposed for the identification of genetic ancestry differences in samples where study participants are assumed to be unrelated, including principal components analysis (PCA), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and model-based methods for proportional ancestry estimation. Many genetic studies, however, include individuals with some degree of relatedness, and existing methods for inferring genetic ancestry fail in related samples. We present a method, PC-AiR, for robust population structure inference in the presence of known or cryptic relatedness. PC-AiR utilizes genome-screen data and an efficient algorithm to identify a diverse subset of unrelated individuals that is representative of all ancestries in the sample. The PC-AiR method directly performs PCA on the identified ancestry representative subset and then predicts components of variation for all remaining individuals based on genetic similarities. In simulation studies and in applications to real data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate that PC-AiR provides a substantial improvement over existing approaches for population structure inference in related samples.  We also demonstrate significant efficiency gains, where a single axis of variation from PC-AiR provides better prediction of ancestry in a variety of structure settings than using ten (or more) components of variation from widely used PCA and MDS approaches.

Variance of microsatellite allele distributions in the human Y-chromosome.,Pre print,"[(Flood, Joe,  Independent researcher)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/008227 ,"Several different methods confirm that a number of micro-satellites on the human Y-chromosome have allele distributions with different variances in different haplogroups, after adjusting for coalescent times. This can be demonstrated through both heteroscedasticity tests and by poor correlation of the variance vectors in different subclades. The most convincing demonstration however is the complete inactivity of some markers in certain subclades – “microsatellite death”, while they are still active in companion subclades. 

Many microsatellites have declined in activity as they proceed down through descendant subclades. This appears to confirm the theory of microsatellite life cycles, in which point mutations cause a steady decay in activity. However, the changes are too fast to be caused by point mutations alone, and slippage events may be implicated.

These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or when genes duplicate and diverge.  Several recent studies have shown the importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution.  Here we investigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise to evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding strength.  Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these protein traits can emerge as evolutionary ""spandrels"" even if they do not confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to stabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious.  Furthermore, such proteins may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending on random mutation events.  These observations may explain the abundance of apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in high-throughput assays.  In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is developed.

Recently available whole genome sequences of three citrus species: one Citrus clementina and two Citrus sinensis genomes have made it possible to understand the features of candidate disease resistance genes with nucleotide-binding sites (NBS) domain in Citrus and how NBS genes differ between hybrid and original Citrus species.
Result
We identified and re-annotated NBS genes from three citrus genomes and found similar numbers of NBS genes in those citrus genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of all citrus NBS genes across three genomes showed that there are three approximately evenly numbered groups: one group contains the Toll-Interleukin receptor (TIR) domain and two different groups that contain the Coiled Coil (CC) domain. Motif analysis confirmed that the two groups of CC-containing NBS genes are from different evolutionary origins. We partitioned NBS genes into clades using NBS domain sequence distances and found most clades include NBS genes from all three citrus genomes. This suggests that NBS genes in three citrus genomes may come from shared ancestral origins. We also mapped the re-sequenced reads of three pomelo and three Mandarin orange genomes onto the Citrus sinensis genome. We found that most NBS genes of the hybrid C. sinensis genome have corresponding homologous genes in both pomelo and mandarin genome. The homologous NBS genes in pomelo and mandarin may explain why the NBS genes in their hybrid Citrus sinensis are similar to those in Citrus clementina in this study. Furthermore, sequence variation amongst citrus NBS genes were shaped by multiple independent and shared accelerated mutation accumulation events among different groups of NBS genes and in different citrus genomes. 
Conclusion
Our comparative analyses yield valuable insight into the understanding of the structure, evolution and organization of NBS genes in Citrus genomes. There are significantly more NBS genes in Citrus genomes compared to other plant species. NBS genes in hybrid C. sinensis genomes are very similar to those in progenitor C. clementina genome and they may be derived from possible common ancestral gene copies. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis showed that there are three groups of plant NBS genes while CC-containing NBS genes can be divided into two groups.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print220.pdf,"[( 21 Aug 2014 , 3)]"

Several recent studies have extended the use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions, rather than genome-wide. Here, we use simulations and whole genome data from Heliconius butterflies to investigate the behavior of D in small genomic regions. We find that D is unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we propose a related statistic f̂d, a modified version of a statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide fraction of admixture. f̂d is not subject to the same biases as D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci.

Previously, we showed that the two most common alleles of a complex amino acid insertion-deletion polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor show independent, parallel clines in frequency across the North American and Australian continents. Here, we report that the cline is stable over at least a five-year period and that the polymorphism also demonstrates temporal shifts in allele frequency concurrent with seasonal change. We tested the alleles for effects on levels of insulin signaling, fecundity, development time, body size, stress tolerance, and lifespan. We find that the alleles are associated with predictable differences in these traits, consistent with patterns of Drosophila life history variation across geography that likely reflect adaptation to the heterogeneous climatic environment.

However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear as to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture.

We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of Bra, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and β-Catenin activity.

However, gene duplication is known to be a rare event in vertebrate genomes and the recruitment of duplicated genes to a novel expression domain (neofunctionalisation) is an even rarer process that requires the evolution of novel combinations of transcription factor binding sites in upstream regulatory regions. Therefore, whilst this hypothesis concerning the evolution of snake venom is therefore very unlikely and should be regarded with caution, it is nonetheless often assumed to be established fact, hindering research into the true origins of snake venom toxins. To critically evaluate this hypothesis we have generated transcriptomic data for body tissues and salivary and venom glands from five species of venomous and non-venomous reptiles.

Indeed, our results show that many proposed venom toxins are in fact expressed in a wide variety of body tissues, including the salivary gland of non-venomous reptiles and that these genes have therefore been restricted to the venom gland following duplication, not recruited.

These correlations have been robustly observed when probing the activity of single neurons. For example, there are cells that activate vigorously when subjects are presented with images of certain celebrities (e.g. the ""Jennifer Aniston"" neuron, Quiroga et al., 2005). While single neuron measurements provide remarkable insights into the functional specificity of different brain areas, it remains unclear how single cell activity arises from, and contributes to, the collective activity of brain networks. New technologies allow for the simultaneous recording of spikes from hundreds of cells, yet we are still far from observing entire neuronal circuits in action.

An alternative approach in monitoring neuronal populations is to measure local field potentials (LFPs). These potentials arise from the coordinated activity of thousands of nearby neurons. LFPs often exhibit oscillations of various frequencies, which correlate with different states of awareness, such as alertness, relaxation, or drowsiness. However, establishing correlations between LFPs and specific behavioral events can be challenging, because the contributions of different neurons to the LFP usually cannot be distinguished. In this chapter, we examine LFPs recorded from the rat hippocampus. At first glance, these LFPs appear to bear little relation to the subject's changing environment. However, through appropriate signal processing, we find that carried in the structure of the LFP is a remarkably precise stream of information.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print223.pdf,"[( 29 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 30 Aug 2014 , 2)]"

But behavioral handedness, i.e. lateralization, is a multifaceted phenomenon. For example, people display clockwise or counter- clockwise biases in their walking behavior that is uncorrelated to their hand dominance, and lateralized behavioral biases have been shown in species as disparate as mice (paw usage), octopi (eye usage), and tortoises (side rolled on during righting). However, the mechanisms by which asymmetries are instilled in behavior are unknown, and a system for studying behavioral handedness in a genetically tractable model system is needed. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster flies exhibit striking variability in their left-right choice behavior during locomotion. Very strongly biased ""left-handed"" and ""right-handed"" individuals are common in every line assayed. The handedness of an individual persists for its lifetime, but is not passed on to progeny, suggesting that mechanisms other than genetics determine individual handedness. We use the Drosophila transgenic toolkit to map a specific set of neurons within the central complex that regulates the strength of behavioral handedness within a line.

Nectar is rich in sugars, but contains additional nutrients, including amino acids (AAs). We tested the preferences of free-flying foragers between 20 AAs at 0.1% w/w in sucrose solutions in an artificial meadow. We found consistent preferences amongst AAs, with essential AAs preferred over nonessential AAs. The preference of foragers correlated negatively with AA induced deviations in pH values, as compared to the control. Next, we quantified tradeoffs between attractive and deterrent AAs at the expense of carbohydrates in nectar. Bees were attracted by phenylalanine, willing to give up 84 units sucrose for 1 unit AA. They were deterred by glycine, and adding 100 or more units of sucrose could resolve to offset 1 unit AA. In addition, we tested physiological effects of AA nutrition on forager homing performance. In a no-choice context, caged bees showed indifference to 0.1% proline, leucine, glycine or phenylanaline in sucrose solutions. Furthermore, flight tests gave no indication that AA nutrition affected flight capacity directly. In contrast, low carbohydrate nutrition reduced the performance of bees, with important methodological implications for homing studies that evaluate the effect of substances that may affect imbibition of sugar solution. In conclusion, low AA concentrations in nectar relative to pollen suggest a limited role in bee nutrition. Most of the 20 AAs evoked a neutral to a mild deterrent response in bees, thus it seems unlikely that bees respond to AAs in nectar as a cue to assess nutritional quality. Nonetheless, free choice behavior of foraging bees is influenced, for instance by phenylalanine and glycine. Thus, AAs in nectar may affect plant-pollinator interactions and thereby exhibit a selective pressure on the flora in the honey bee habitat.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Insect Physiology/Journal of Insect Physiology1.pdf,"[( 22 Oct 2014 , 1), ( 30 Aug 2014 , 1)]"

However, we still know little about the genetic architecture of gene expression variation in other species, particularly our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates. To address this gap, we performed an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based study of 63 wild baboons, members of the intensively studied Amboseli baboon population in Kenya. Our study design allowed us to measure gene expression levels and identify genetic variants using the same data set, enabling us to perform complementary mapping of putative cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and measurements of allele-specific expression (ASE) levels. We discovered substantial evidence for genetic effects on gene expression levels in this population. Surprisingly, we found more power to detect individual eQTL in the baboons relative to a HapMap human data set of comparable size, probably as a result of greater genetic variation, enrichment of SNPs with high minor allele frequencies, and longer-range linkage disequilibrium in the baboons. eQTL were most likely to be identified for lineage-specific, rapidly evolving genes. Interestingly, genes with eQTL significantly overlapped between the baboon and human data sets, suggesting that some genes may tolerate more genetic perturbation than others, and that this property may be conserved across species. Finally, we used a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model to partition genetic, demographic, and early environmental contributions to variation in gene expression levels. We found a strong genetic contribution to gene expression levels for almost all genes, while individual demographic and environmental effects tended to be more modest. Together, our results establish the feasibility of eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data alone, and act as an important first step towards understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression variation in nonhuman primates.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife15.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2014 , 3), ( 28 Aug 2014 , 4), ( 20 Oct 2014 , 2)]"

To determine colony nutritional demands, we analyzed a yearly cycle of bee-collected pollen from colonies in the field and compared it to colony worker production and honey bee body composition, for the first time in social insects. We monitored monthly bee production in ten colonies at each of seven sites throughout Israel, and trapped pollen bi-monthly in five additional colonies at each of four of these sites. Pollen mixtures from each sampling date and site were analyzed for weight, total protein, total fatty acids (FAs), and FA composition. Compared to more temperate climates, the eastern Mediterranean allows a relatively high yearly colony growth of ca. 300,000 to 400,000 bees. Colonies at higher elevation above sea level showed lower growth rates. Queen egg-laying rate did not seem to limit growth, as peaks in capped brood areas showed that queens lay a prolific 2,000 eggs a day on average, with up to 3,300 eggs in individual cases. Pollen uptake varied significantly among sites and seasons, with an overall annual mean total 16.8 kg per colony, containing 7.14 kg protein and 677 g fat. Overall mean pollen protein content was high (39.8%), and mean total FA content was 3.8%. Production cost, as expressed by the amount of nutrient used per bee, was least variable for linoleic acid and protein, suggesting these as the best descriptive variables for total number of bees produced. Linolenic acid levels in pollen during the autumn were relatively low, and supplementing colonies with this essential FA may mitigate potential nutritional deficiency. The essentiality of linoleic and linolenic acids was consistent with these FAs' tendency to be present at higher levels in collected pollen than in the expected nutrients in bee bodies, demonstrating a well-developed adjustment between pollinator nutritional demands and the nutritional value of food offered by pollinated plants.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Insect Physiology/Journal of Insect Physiology2.pdf,"[( 30 Aug 2014 , 1)]"

The spatial predictions of this theory have repeatedly performed well at predicting diversity patterns across scales. However, the theoretical development and evaluation of METE has focused on predicting patterns that ignore inter-site spatial correlations. As a result the theory has not been evaluated using one of the core components of spatial structure.  We develop and test a semi-recursive version of METE?s spatially explicit predictions for the distance decay relationship of community similarity and compare METE?s performance to the classic random placement model of completely random species distributions. This provides a better understanding and stronger test of METE?s spatial community predictions. We analytically derived and simulated METE?s spatially explicit expectations for the Sorensen index of community similarity. We then compared the distance decay of community similarity of 16 mapped plant communities to METE and the random placement model. The version of METE we examined was successful at capturing the general functional form of empirical distance decay relationships, a negative power function relationship between community similarity and distance. However, the semi-recursive approach consistently over-predicted the degree and rate of species turnover and yielded worse predictions than the random placement model. Our results suggest that while METE's current spatial models accurately predict the spatial scaling of species occupancy, and therefore core ecological patterns like the species-area relationship, its semi-recursive form does not accurately characterize spatially-explicit patterns of correlation.

We compute invasion rates corresponding to the rates at which the abundance of an initially rare morph increases in the presence of the other morph established at equilibrium.  If both morphs have positive invasion rates when rare, then there is an equilibrium distribution such that the two morphs coexist; that is, there is a protected polymorphism for habitat selection. Alternatively, if one morph has a negative invasion rate when rare, then it is asymptotically displaced by the other morph under all initial conditions where both morphs are present.

When a U1 recognition site is placed into the 3’-terminal exon or adjacent to the termination codon, pre-mRNA is cleaved at the 3’-end and degraded, leading to an efficient knockdown of the gene of interest (GOI).

Because this is a new prevention strategy targeting large numbers of healthy people, we broadly assessed its effects on the mucosa.
METHODS AND FINDINGS In MTN-007, a phase 1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies taken at baseline, after one application or after seven daily applications (15 subjects/arm). Experiments were repeated using primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women. After seven days of administration, tenofovir 1% gel had broad-ranging biological effects on the rectal mucosa, which were much more pronounced than—but different from—those caused by the detergent nonoxynol-9. Tenofovir profoundly suppressed anti-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 10; increased T cell densities; caused mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly by blocking PNPT1 expression; and altered regulatory pathways of cell differentiation and survival. Except for leukocyte-derived factors, all these effects were replicated in primary vaginal epithelial cells, which also proliferated significantly faster in tenofovir’s presence.
CONCLUSIONS Tenofovir’s suppression of anti-inflammatory activity could diminish its prophylactic efficacy over time. The breadth of mucosal changes, including mitochondrial dysfunction and epithelial proliferation, raises questions about its safety for long-term topical use. These findings suggest that a systems biology evaluation of mucosal effects may be beneficial before advancing to large-scale efficacy trials with topical HIV prevention agents that achieve high, long-lasting local drug concentrations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife17.pdf,"[( 02 Sep 2014 , 2), ( 01 Sep 2014 , 1)]"

Each individual’s PML is conditional not only on that individual’s case-control status, but also on every individual’s case-control status and on the genetic relationship matrix obtained from the data.  The PML are estimated using a multivariate Gibbs sampler, with the liability-scale phenotypic covariance matrix based on the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) and a heritability parameter estimated via Haseman-Elston regression on case-control phenotypes followed by transformation to liability scale.  In simulations of unrelated individuals, the LTMLM statistic was correctly calibrated and achieved higher power than existing mixed model methods in all scenarios tested, with the magnitude of the improvement depending on sample size and severity of case-control ascertainment.

However, in vivo experimental support remains inconclusive. Here we develop a minimal spatial mathematical model of glucose-lactate metabolism to examine, in principle, whether metabolic symbiosis is plausible in human tumours, and to assess the potential impact of inhibiting it. We find that symbiosis is a robust feature of our model system---although on the length scale at which oxygen supply is diffusion-limited, its occurrence requires very high cellular metabolic activity---and that necrosis in the tumour core is reduced in the presence of symbiosis. Upon simulating therapeutic inhibition of lactate uptake, we predict that targeted treatment increases the extent of tissue oxygenation without increasing core necrosis. The oxygenation effect is correlated strongly with the extent of wildtype hypoxia and only weakly with wildtype symbiotic behaviour, and therefore may be promising for radiosensitisation of hypoxic, lactate-consuming tumours even if they do not exhibit a spatially well-defined symbiosis. Finally, we conduct a set of in vitro experiments on the U87 glioblastoma cell line to facilitate preliminary speculation as to where highly malignant tumours might fall in our parameter space, and find that these experiments suggest a weakly symbiotic regime for U87 cells, which raises the new question of what relationship exists between symbiosis---if indeed it occurs in vivo---and tumour malignancy.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Theoretical Biology/Journal of Theoretical Biology1.pdf,"[( 04 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 05 Sep 2014 , 3), ( 06 Nov 2016 , 1)]"

One of the most important assumptions is that traits are controlled by many genes of small effect. This leads to a prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since these biological assumptions are often unknown or untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci or large mutational effects can impact the sampling distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we developed a neutral coalescent-based framework, allowing us to experiment freely with the number of loci and the underlying mutational model. Through both analytical theory and simulation we found the normality assumption was highly sensitive to the details of the mutational process, with the greatest discrepancies arising when the number of loci was small or the mutational kernel was heavy-tailed. In particular, fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal sampling distributions for any number of loci. An empirical analysis of 7079 expressed genes in 49 Neurospora crassa strains identified 116 genes with non-normal sampling distributions. Several genes showed evidence of multimodality and/or skewness, suggesting the importance of their genetic architecture.

The question of how closely the effects of genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open. Here, we addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of genes. Allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two strains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, most effects on translation were of small magnitude, such that the direction of an mRNA difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was similar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation to cause larger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA differences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast species that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation termination in the two yeast strains and also found several instances where erroneous reference gene annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that in fact reside outside of the translated gene body.

How winners compensate for costs and minimize the threat of Pyrrhic victory is not well known. This study tracked the outcomes of experimentally induced field conflicts between highly territorial Acacia ant Crematogaster mimosae colonies using molecular genetics, and discovered that fatal fights significantly decrease within-colony worker relatedness. We find that reduced relatedness can be explained by colonies increasing worker number via 1) non-kin enemy adoption or 2) queen-right colony fusion. We hypothesize that incorporating non-kin enemies can speed recovery from conflict when resource defense is paramount. In the case of queen-right colony fusion, territorial defense benefits could outweigh fitness costs. We provide evidence that winners of colony fights have reduced worker forces to defend larger territories. Field assays indicate that post-fight colonies are more vulnerable to heavy browsing of host trees by mega-herbivores and takeover by competitors following conflict.

Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of QST/FST comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and two inflammatory bowel disease datasets.

To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors. All lines appear to be free of integration from exogenous reprogramming vectors, can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques, and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA sequencing data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast precursors, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors, which were of multiple cell type and population origins. Overall, we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic precursors, indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic cells of different origins. We identified 4,918 differentially expressed genes and 3,598 differentially methylated regions between iPSCs of the two species, many of which are novel inter-species differences that were not observed between the somatic cells of the two species.

This change between life-cycle stages is often associated with a change in diet or a transition between a non-feeding and a feeding form. How larvae regulate changes in feeding during this life cycle transition is not well understood. Neuropeptides are known to regulate several aspects of feeding, such as food search, ingestion and digestion. The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has a complex life cycle with a pelagic non-feeding larval stage and a benthic feeding postlarval stage, linked by the process of settlement. The conserved neuropeptide myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) is a key regulator of larval settlement behavior in Platynereis. Whether MIP also regulates the initiation of feeding, another aspect of the pelagic-to-benthic transition in Platynereis, is currently unknown. Here, we explore the contribution of MIP to feeding in settled Platynereis postlarvae. We find that MIP is expressed in the gut of developing larvae in sensory neurons that densely innervate the foregut and hindgut. Activating MIP signaling by synthetic neuropeptide addition causes increased gut peristalsis and more frequent pharynx extensions leading to increased food intake. Conversely, morpholino-mediated knockdown of MIP expression inhibits feeding. In the long-term, treatment of Platynereis postlarvae with synthetic MIP increases growth rate and results in earlier cephalic metamorphosis. Our results show that MIP activates ingestion and digestion in Platynereis postlarvae. MIP is expressed in sensory-neurosecretory cells of the digestive system indicating that following larval settlement, feeding is initiated by a direct sensory mechanism. This is similar to the mechanism by which MIP induces larval settlement. The pleiotropic roles of MIP may thus have evolved by redeploying the same signaling mechanism in different aspects of a life cycle transition.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Zoology/Frontiers in Zoology1.pdf,"[( 08 Sep 2014 , 5)]"

Whereas nuclear genes are bi-parentally inherited, mitochondrial and chloroplast genes are almost exclusively maternally inherited, and this asymmetry may lead to a bias in the chromosomal distribution of nuclear genes whose products act in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. In particular, because X-linked genes have a higher probability of co-transmission with organellar genes (2/3) compared to autosomal genes (1/2), selection for co-adaptation has been predicted to lead to an over-representation of nuclear-mitochondrial (N-mt) or nuclear-chloroplast (N-cp) genes on the X chromosome relative to autosomes. In contrast, the occurrence of sexually antagonistic organellar mutations might lead to selection for movement of cyto-nuclear genes from the X chromosome to autosomes to reduce male mutation load. Recent broad-scale comparative studies of N-mt distributions in animals have found evidence for these hypotheses in some species, but not others. Here, we use transcriptome sequences to conduct the first study of the chromosomal distribution of cyto-nuclear interacting genes in a plant species with sex chromosomes (Rumex hastatulus; Polygonaceae). We found no evidence of under- or over-representation of either N-mt or N-cp genes on the X chromosome, and thus no support for either the co-adaptation or the sexual-conflict hypothesis.

The insertion of a transposable element (Hopscotch) upstream of tb1 is known to enhance the gene's expression, causing reduced tillering in maize. Observations of the maize tb1 allele in teosinte and estimates of an insertion  age of the Hopscotch that predates domestication led us to investigate its prevalence and potential role in teosinte. 

Methods: Prevalence of the Hopscotch element was assessed across an Americas-wide sample of 837 maize and teosinte individuals using a codominant PCR assay. Population genetic summaries were calculated for a subset of individuals from four teosinte populations in central Mexico.  Phenotypic data were also collected using seed from a single teosinte  population where Hopscotch was found segregating at high frequency. 

Key results: Genotyping results indicate the Hopscotch element is found in a number of teosinte populations and linkage disequilibrium near tb1 does not support recent introgression from maize. Population genetic signatures are consistent with selection on this locus revealing a potential ecological role for Hopscotch in teosinte, but a greenhouse experiment does not detect a strong association between tb1 and tillering in teosinte.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest the role of Hopscotch differs between maize and teosinte.

Importantly, DA neuronal bursting is associated with a significantly greater degree of DA release than an equivalent tonic activity pattern. Here, we introduce a single compartmental, conductance-based computational model for DA cell activity that captures the behavior of DA neuronal dynamics and examine the multiple factors that underlie DA firing modes: the strength of the SK conductance, the amount of drive, and GABA inhibition. Our results suggest that neurons with low SK conductance are in a fast firing mode, are correlated with burst
firing, and require higher levels of applied current before undergoing depolarization block. We go on to consider the role of GABAergic inhibition on an ensemble of dynamical classes of DA neurons and find that strong GABA inhibition suppresses burst firing. Our studies suggest differences in the distribution of the SK conductance and GABA inhibition levels may indicate subclasses of DA neurons within the VTA.

Two nucleotide substitutions are mainly described in animals, from adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and from cytidine to uridine (C-to-U). This phenomenon is more and more described in mammals, notably since the availability of next generation sequencing technologies allowing a whole genome screening of RNA-DNA differences. The number of studies recording RNA editing in other vertebrates like chicken are still limited. We chose to use high throughput sequencing technologies to search for RNA editing in chicken, to understand to what extent this phenomenon is conserved in vertebrates. 
We performed RNA and DNA sequencing from 8 embryos. Being aware of common pitfalls inherent to sequence analyses leading to false positive discovery, we stringently filtered our datasets and found less than 40 reliable candidates. Conservation of particular sites of RNA editing was attested by the presence of 3 edited sites previously detected in mammals.  We then characterized editing levels for selected candidates in several tissues and at different time points, from 4.5 days of embryonic development to adults, and observed a clear tissue-specificity and a gradual editing level increase with time.
By characterizing the RNA editing landscape in chicken, our results highlight the extent of evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon within vertebrates, and provide support of an absence of non A-to-I events from the chicken transcriptome.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE33.pdf,"[( 09 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 10 Sep 2014 , 7)]"

Here, we examine how the altered metabolism of cancer cells is reflected in changes in co-expression patterns of metabolic genes between normal and tumor tissues. Our emphasis on changes in the interactions of pairs of genes, rather than on the expression levels of individual genes, exposes changes in the activity of metabolic pathways which do not necessarily show clear patterns of over- or under-expression. We report the existence of key metabolic genes which act as hubs of differential co-expression, showing significantly different co-regulation patterns between normal and tumor states. Notably, we find that the extent of differential co-expression of a gene is only weakly correlated with its differential expression, suggesting that the two measures probe different features of metabolism. By leveraging our findings against existing pathway knowledge, we extract networks of functionally connected differentially co-expressed genes and the transcription factors which regulate them. Doing so, we identify a previously unreported network of dysregulated metabolic genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma transcriptionally controlled by the transcription factor HNF4A. While HNF4A shows no significant differential expression, the co-expression HNF4A and several of its regulated target genes in normal tissue is completely abrogated in tumor tissue. Finally, we aggregate the results of differential co-expression analysis across seven distinct cancer types to identify pairs of metabolic genes which may be recurrently dysregulated.

Analysis of expression and mRNA binding data revealed hundreds of mRNAs bound in their 3' UTRs by both CELF1 and and the developmentally induced Mbnl1 protein, 3-fold more than expected.  The relative extent of CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding in 3' UTRs predicted the extent of repression or stabilization, respectively, following CELF induction.

Several hundred messages contained proximal CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding sites (within 50 bases), and were more strongly repressed by CELF1 than messages with distal sites.  Messages with different spacing of CELF and Mbnl sites in their 3' UTRs exhibited different developmental dynamics, suggesting that spacing is used to tune cytoplasmic competition between these factors to specify the timing of developmental induction.

To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of Drosophila inbred lines and focused on locomotor handedness, in an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes.

Our results revealed an unprecedented prevalence of segregating loss-of-function (LoF) taste receptor variants, identifying one of the most pronounced cases of functional population diversity in the human genome. LoF variant frequency was considerably higher than the overall mutation rate, and many humans harbored varying numbers of critical mutations. In particular, molecular evolutionary rates of sour and bitter receptors were far higher in humans than those of sweet, salty, and umami receptors compared with other carnivorous mammals although not all of the taste receptors genes were identified. Many LoF variants are population-specific, some of which arose even after the population differentiation, but not before divergence of the modern and archaic (Neanderthal and Denisovan) human.

We present here a NGS-based tool for InDel marker discovery (mInDel), a high-performance computing pipeline for the development of InDel markers between any two genotypes. The mInDel pipeline proficiently develops InDel markers by comparing shared region size using sliding alignments between assembled contigs or reference genomes. mInDel has successfully designed thousands of InDel markers from maize NGS data locally and genome-wide. The program needs less than 2 hours to run when using 20 threads on a high-performance computing server to implement 40G data.mInDel is an efficient, integrated pipeline for a high-throughput design of InDel markers between genotypes.

INDELs, especially those disrupting protein-coding regions of the genome, have been strongly associated with human diseases. However, there are still many errors with INDEL variant calling, driven by library preparation, sequencing biases, and algorithm artifacts. 

Methods
We characterized whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and PCR-free sequencing data from the same samples to investigate the sources of INDEL errors. We also developed a classification scheme based on the coverage and composition to rank high and low quality INDEL calls. We performed a large-scale validation experiment on 600 loci, and find high-quality INDELs to have a substantially lower error rate than low quality INDELs (7% vs. 51%). 

Results 
Simulation and experimental data show that assembly based callers are significantly more sensitive and robust for detecting large INDELs (>5bp) than alignment based callers, consistent with published data. The concordance of INDEL detection between WGS and WES is low (52%), and WGS data uniquely identifies 10.8-fold more high-quality INDELs. The validation rate for WGS-specific INDELs is also much higher than that for WES-specific INDELs (85% vs. 54%), and WES misses many large INDELs. In addition, the concordance for INDEL detection between standard WGS and PCR-free sequencing is 71%, and standard WGS data uniquely identifies 6.3-fold more low-quality INDELs. Furthermore, accurate detection with Scalpel of heterozygous INDELs requires 1.2-fold higher coverage than that for homozygous INDELs. Lastly, homopolymer A/T INDELs are a major source of low-quality INDEL calls, and they are highly enriched in the WES data. 

Conclusions
Overall, we show that accuracy of INDEL detection with WGS is much greater than WES even in the targeted region. We calculated that 60X WGS depth of coverage from the HiSeq platform is needed to recover 95% of INDELs detected by Scalpel. While this is higher than current sequencing practice, the deeper coverage may save total project costs because of the greater accuracy and sensitivity. Finally, we investigate sources of INDEL errors (e.g. capture deficiency, PCR amplification, homopolymers) with various data that will serve as a guideline to effectively reduce INDEL errors in genome sequencing.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Medicine/Genome Medicine4.pdf,"[( 19 Sep 2014 , 4), ( 19 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 04 Aug 2014 , 2), ( 10 Jun 2014 , 8), ( 23 Oct 2014 , 1), ( 17 Sep 2014 , 9), ( 18 Sep 2014 , 2), ( 13 Jun 2014 , 3), ( 12 Jun 2014 , 2), ( 17 Jun 2014 , 2), ( 11 Jun 2014 , 15), ( 16 Jun 2014 , 2), ( 25 Jun 2014 , 1), ( 11 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 14 Jun 2014 , 1)]"

The distributions of these two major types of DNA methylation, along with 5-methylcytosine (5mC), comprise the bacterial methylome, some rare exceptions notwithstanding. SMRT sequencing has already revealed marked diversity in bacterial methylomes as well as the existence of heterogeneity of methylation in cells in single bacterial colonies, where such ‘epigenetic’ variation can enable bacterial populations to rapidly adapt to changing conditions. However, current methods for studying bacterial methylomes using SMRT sequencing mainly rely on population-level summaries that do not provide the single-cell resolution necessary for dissecting the epigenetic heterogeneity in bacterial populations. Here, we present a novel SMRT sequencing-based framework, consisting of two complementary methods, for single molecule-level detection of DNA methylation and assessment of methyltransferase activity through single molecule-level long read-based epigenetic phasing. Using seven bacterial strains and integrating data from SMRT and Illumina sequencing, we show that our method yields significantly improved resolution compared to existing population-level methods, and reveals several distinct types of epigenetic heterogeneity.

The human gut microbiome is associated with the development of colon cancer, and recent studies have found changes in the composition of the microbial communities in cancer patients compared to healthy controls. However, host-bacteria interactions are mainly expected to occur in the cancer microenvironment, whereas current studies primarily use stool samples to survey the microbiome. Here, we highlight the major shifts in the colorectal tumor microbiome relative to that of matched normal colon tissue from the same individual, allowing us to survey the microbial communities at the tumor microenvironment, and provides intrinsic control for environmental and host genetic effects on the microbiome.

Results
We characterized the microbiome in 44 primary tumor and 44 patient-matched normal colon tissues. We find that tumors harbor distinct microbial communities compared to nearby healthy tissue. Our results show increased microbial diversity at the tumor microenvironment, with changes in the abundances of commensal and pathogenic bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium and Providencia. While Fusobacteria has previously been implicated in CRC, Providencia is a novel tumor- associated agent, and has several features that make it a potential cancer driver, including a strong immunogenic LPS and an ability to damage colorectal tissue. Additionally, we identified a significant enrichment of virulence-associated genes in the colorectal cancer microenvironment.

Conclusions
This work identifies bacterial taxa significantly correlated with colorectal cancer, including a novel finding of an elevated abundance of Providencia in the tumor microenvironment. We also describe several metabolic pathways and enzymes differentially present in the tumor associated microbiome, and show that the bacterial genes in the tumor microenvironment are enriched for virulence associated genes from the aggregate microbial community. This virulence enrichment indicates that the microbiome likely plays an active role in colorectal cancer development and/or progression.

A plant’s reproductive allocation (RA) schedule describes the fraction of surplus energy allocated to reproduction as it increases in size. RA schedules distinguish between energy allocated to different tissue types and thus links to a key physiological trade-off in an organism’s functioning and life history. While theorists have adopted RA schedules as an elegant connection between life history and energy allocation, little is known about RA schedules in real vegetation.
2.	Here we review what is known about RA schedules for woody plants using studies either directly quantifying RA, or which collected data from which the shape of an RA schedule can be inferred.
3.	We find that RA schedules vary considerably across species: some species abruptly shift all resources from growth to reproduction (the “big-bang” strategy); most others gradually shift resources into reproduction, but under a variety of graded schedules (“partial bang”, “asymptotic”, “gradual”, and “declining”). Available data suggest the maximum fraction of energy allocated to production ranges from 0.1 to 1 and that shorter-lived species have higher initial RA and increase their RA more quickly than do longer-lived species.
4.	'Synthesis' Available data suggests a wide variety of RA schedules exist among plant species. The collection of more data on RA, and not only on easy-to-measure proxies such as maximum height, would enable a tighter integration between theory and observation in plant ecology.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print252.pdf,"[( 19 Sep 2014 , 2)]"

As such, it constrains the evolution of sexual dimorphism and may therefore have implications for adaptive evolution. There is currently considerable evidence for the existence of sexually antagonistic genetic variation in laboratory and natural populations, but how sexual antagonism interacts with other evolutionary phenomena is still poorly understood in many cases. Here we explore how self-fertilization and inbreeding affect the maintenance of polymorphism for sexually antagonistic loci. We expected a priori that selfing should reduce the region of polymorphism, since inbreeding reduces the frequency of heterozygotes and speeds fixation. Although this expectation was supported, our results show that there is an interactive effect between the degree of selfing and dominance such that those segregating sexually antagonistic loci that do exist are more likely to be partially dominant. In addition, inbreeding effects may influence population persistence and genomic location of sexually antagonistic loci in separate-sexed organisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print253.pdf,"[( 19 Sep 2014 , 7), ( 21 Sep 2014 , 1)]"

It is not yet clear what the driving force behind the activation of C-MYC expression in prostate cancer is. CTCF, which is known for its role as chromatin organiser, is thought to be involved in the activation of C-MYC expression. The affinity of CTCF to its binding site on the DNA is negatively affected by methylation of CpG islands, including its binding site within the promoter sequences of C-MYC. DNA hypermethylation is often found in cancer cells and could therefore be responsible for reduced binding of CTCF at the C-MYC promoter, which can in turn lead to enhanced expression. Here, the copy number of C-MYC of five different prostate cancer cell lines has been determined by FISH, and the state of methylation of the binding site of CTCF upstream of C-MYC was investigated. The C-MYC locus was shown to be amplified to various degrees in all cell lines, reflecting the copy number of actual tumors very well, but methylation was found to remain unchanged compared to healthy cells in all examined cell lines. Hence, no correlation between C-MYC-copy number and CTCF binding possibilities could be established. The enhanced expression of C-MYC in prostate cancer cell lines is not affected by CTCF, whose binding presumably still persists.  C-MYC activation in prostate cancer must therefore be caused by a disparate mechanism, which also deviates from other well known mechanisms that are seen in Burkitt-Lymphoma, Leukemia and breast cancer.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print254.pdf,"[( 29 Sep 2014 , 2), ( 30 Sep 2014 , 1), ( 06 Oct 2014 , 1)]"

With this unusual information, we tested whether population-genetic-based approaches could have been utilized to identify the adaptive locus. Contrary to published claims, we conclude that the use of the background site frequency spectrum as a null model is largely ineffective in bottlenecked populations. Results are quantified both for site frequency spectrum and linkage disequilibrium-based predictions, and are found to hold true across a large parameter space that encompasses many species and populations currently under study.

We studied a farmer-led initiative where a mixture of four French wheat landraces called ""Mélange de Touselles"" (MDT) was created and distributed within a farmers' network. Fifteen populations derived by farmers from the initial mixture were sampled after 2 to 7 generations of cultivation on their farm.

An original network-based approach was developed to depict the particular and complex genetic structure of the landraces composing the mixture. 
A rapid differentiation of the mixture was detected, larger at the phenotypic and gene levels compared to the neutral genetic level, indicating a potential divergent selection. We identified two interacting selection processes: variation of the mixture component frequencies and evolution of the within-variety diversity, that shaped the standing variability available within the mixture. These results confirm that farmers' practices increase genetic diversity and allow crop evolution, which is critical in the context of global change.

This spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the nervous system.  In this study, we had two aims.  First, to characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of developing networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons dissociated from mouse.  Second, to assess whether there are any functional differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal and cortical networks.

Results: We used multielectrode arrays to record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons every two or three days for the first month after plating.  Within a few days of culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity.  This activity strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21 days in vitro.  We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and cortical networks using eleven features.  Three out of eleven features showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and cortical networks.  1: Interburst intervals are less variable in spike trains from hippocampal cultures.  2: Hippocampal networks have higher correlations. 3: Hippocampal networks generate more robust theta bursting patterns.  Machine learning techniques confirmed that these differences in patterning are sufficient to reliably classify recordings at any given age as either hippocampal or cortical networks.

Conclusions: Although cultured networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate spontaneous activity that changes over time, at any given time we can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns.  We anticipate that this quantitative framework could have applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and for characterising phenotype of different mutant mice.

Taken together, these patterns call into question the identity of all species within Escallonia. To evaluate the currently proposed hypotheses of species boundaries, I used molecular, morphological, and bioclimatic a data for 35 species and assessed three species criteria: genealogical exclusivity, morphological gaps, and climatic niche differences. Interpreting these data in the context of species as segments of evolutionary lineages, I provide evidence that most species (ca. 70%) within Escallonia represent distinct species on independent evolutionary trajectories.

We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3' splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA.

Many approaches remove from consideration common variants above a given frequency threshold (e.g. 1%), and then prioritize the remaining variants according to their allele frequency, functional, structural and conservation properties. In this work, we present methods that leverage the genetic structure of different populations while accounting for the finite sample size of the reference panels to improve the variant filtering step.

We then introduce a new procedure to detect selection at the pathway level based on a decomposition of the classical McDonald-Kreitman test extended to multiple genes. This new test, called 2DNS, detects outlier gene sets and takes into account past demographic effects as well as evolutionary constraints specific to gene sets. Selective forces acting on gene sets can be easily identified by a mere visual inspection of the position of the gene sets relative to their 2D null distribution. We thus find several outlier gene sets that show signals of positive, balancing, or purifying selection, but also others showing an ancient relaxation of selective constraints. The principle of the 2DNS test can also be applied to other genomic contrasts.

However, this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors, especially at hypermutable sites, and spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. Here we propose a new method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating polarization errors and taking spatial heterogeneity into account. This method is very general in that it does not require any prior knowledge about the source of polarization errors and also provides information about mutation patterns. We apply this approach to human polymorphism data from the 1000 genomes project. We show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. We further find that the impact of gBGC is concentrated primarily within recombination hotspots: genome-wide, the strength of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area, but 2% of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC, with population-scaled gBGC coefficients above 5. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research9.pdf,"[( 11 Oct 2014 , 3), ( 10 Oct 2014 , 4), ( 12 Oct 2014 , 1), ( 09 Oct 2014 , 3)]"

Although the area an individual RPC demands at its basal surface declines during optic cup formation, we find a 4.7 fold increase of the entire basal surface of the optic cup.

Validating the new setups is a crucial part of conducting rigorous scientific research. Here we report on the reliability and biases of performing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We designed a protocol using 50 barcode pairs to run samples in parallel and coded a pipeline to process the data. Sequencing the same sediment sample in 248 replicates as well as 70 samples from alkaline soda lakes, we evaluated the performance of the method with regards to estimates of alpha and beta diversity.

Using different purification and DNA quantification procedures we always found up to 5-fold differences in the yield of sequences between individually barcodes samples. Using either a one-step or a two-step PCR preparation resulted in significantly different estimates in both alpha and beta diversity. Comparing with a previous method based on 454 pyrosequencing, we found that our Illumina protocol performed in a similar manner -- with the exception for evenness estimates where correspondence between the methods was low.

We further quantified the data loss at every processing step eventually accumulating to 50\% of the raw reads. When evaluating different OTU clustering methods, we observed a stark contrast between the results of QIIME with default settings and the more recent UPARSE algorithm when it comes to the number of OTUs generated. Still, overall trends in alpha and beta diversity corresponded highly using both clustering methods. 

Our procedure performed well considering the precisions of alpha and beta diversity estimates, with insignificant effects of individual barcodes. Comparative analyses suggest that 454 and Illumina sequence data can be combined if the same PCR protocol and bioinformatic workflows are used for describing patterns in richness, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition.

We applied brute-force algorithms to detect all possible exon-skipping events, which were ubiquitous but rare compared to canonical splicing events. Exon-skipping events increased in cells deficient for the nuclear exosome or the 5?-3? exonuclease Dhp1, and also at late stages of meiotic differentiation when nuclear-exosome transcripts were down-regulated. The pervasive exon-skipping transcripts were stochastic, did not increase in specific physiological conditions, and were mostly present at below 1 copy per cell, even in the absence of nuclear RNA surveillance and late during meiosis. These exon-skipping transcripts are therefore unlikely to be functional and may reflect splicing errors that are actively removed by nuclear RNA surveillance. The average splicing error-rate was ~0.24% in wild-type and ~1.75% in nuclear exonuclease mutants. Using an exhaustive search algorithm, we also uncovered thousands of previously unknown splice sites, indicating pervasive splicing, yet most of these novel splicing events were rare and targeted for nuclear degradation.

Well-supported euthyneuran phylogenies with detailed morphological data can provide information on the historical, biological and ecological background in which these habitat shifts took place allowing for comparison across taxa. Acochlidian slugs are ""basal pulmonates"" with uncertain relationships to other major panpulmonate clades. They present a unique evolutionary history with representatives in the marine mesopsammon, but also benthic lineages in brackish water, limnic habitats and (semi-)terrestrial environments. We present the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny on Acochlidia, based on a global sampling that covers nearly 85% of the described species diversity, and additionally, nearly doubles known diversity by undescribed taxa. Our phylogenetic hypotheses are highly congruent with previous morphological analyses and confirm all included recognized families and genera. We further establish an ancestral area chronogram for Acochlidia, document changes in diversification rates in their evolution via the birth-death-shift-model and reconstruct the ancestral states for major ecological traits. Based on our data, Acochlidia originated from a marine, mesopsammic ancestor adapted to tropical waters, in the mid Mesozoic Jurassic. We found that the two major subclades present a remarkably different evolutionary history. The Microhedylacea are morphologically highly-adapted to the marine mesopsammon. They show a circum-tropical distribution with several independent shifts to temperate and temperate cold-habitats, but remained in stunning morphological and ecological stasis since the late Mesozoic. Their evolutionary specialization, which includes a remarkable and potentially irreversible ""meiofaunal syndrome"", guaranteed long-term survival and locally high species densities but also resembles a dead-end road to morphological and ecological diversity. In contrast, the Hedylopsacea are characterized by morphological flexibility and ecologically by independent habitat shifts out of the marine mesopsammon, conquering (semi-)terrestrial and limnic habitats. Originating from interstitial ancestors with moderate adaptations to the mesopsammic world, they reestablished a benthic lifestyle and secondary ""gigantism"" in body size. The major radiations and habitat shifts in hedylopsacean families occured in the central Indo-West Pacific in the Paleogene. In the Western Atlantic only one enigmatic representative is known probably presenting a relict of a former pan-Tethys distribution of the clade. This study on acochlidian phylogeny and biogeography adds another facet of the yet complex panpulmonate evolution and shows the various parallel pathways in which these snails and slugs invaded non-marine habitats.

First, we show that by analyzing metabolic end products we can consistently predict growth conditions. Second, prediction is reliable even in the presence of small amounts of impurities. Third, flux through a relatively small number of reactions per growth source (~10) is sufficient for accurate prediction. Fourth, combining the predictions from two separate models, one trained only on carbon sources and one only on nitrogen sources, performs better than models trained to perform joint prediction.

To investigate potential biases, we simulated communities of 20 identical species with log-series abundances but without species-specific interactions. We expected no relationship of conspecific neighbor effects with species abundance. Growth of individual trees was simulated in random and aggregated spatial patterns using no, linear, or squared distance decay.

Accurately determining the diversity of mtDNA has been difficult, due to the relatively small amount of mtDNA in each cell (< 1% of the total DNA), the intercellular variability of mtDNA content and mtDNA pseudogenes (Numts) in nDNA. To understand the nature of heteroplasmy, we developed Mseek, a novel technique to purify and sequence mtDNA. Mseek yields high purity (> 90%) mtDNA and its ability to detect rare variants is limited only by sequencing depth, providing unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. Using Mseek, we confirmed the ubiquity of heteroplasmy by analyzing mtDNA from a diverse set of cell lines and human samples. Applying Mseek to colonies derived from single cells, we find heteroplasmy is stably maintained in individual daughter cells over multiple cell divisions. We hypothesized that the stability of heteroplasmy could be facilitated by inter-cellular exchange of mtDNA.

We describe Ancestry Composition, a modular three-stage pipeline that efficiently and accurately identifies the ancestral origin of chromosomal segments in admixed individuals. It assumes the genotype data have been phased. In the first stage, a support vector machine classifier assigns tentative ancestry labels to short local phased genomic regions.  In the second stage, an autoregressive pair hidden Markov model simultaneously corrects phasing errors and produces reconciled local ancestry estimates and confidence scores based on the tentative ancestry labels.  In the third stage, confidence estimates are recalibrated using isotonic regression.

We compiled a reference panel of almost 10,000 individuals of homogeneous ancestry, derived from a combination of several publicly available datasets and over 8,000 individuals reporting four grandparents with the same country-of-origin from the member database of the personal genetics company, 23andMe, Inc., and excluding outliers identified through principal components analysis (PCA).

Here we apply three Bayesian dating methods that differ in how calibration is achieved--""node dating"" (ND) in BEAST, ""total evidence"" (TE) dating in MrBayes, and the ""fossilized birth-death"" (FBD) in FDPPDiv--to infer divergence times in the Osmundaceae or royal ferns. Osmundaceae have 13 species in four genera, two mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and two in South Africa and Australasia; they are the sister clade to the remaining leptosporangiate ferns. Their fossil record consists of at least 150 species in ~17 genera and three extinct families. For ND, we used the five oldest fossils, while for TE and FBD dating, which do not require forcing fossils to nodes and thus can use more fossils, we included up to 36 rhizome and frond compression/impression fossils, which for TE dating were scored for 33 morphological characters. We also subsampled 10%, 25%, and 50% of the 36 fossils to assess model sensitivity. FBD-derived divergence dates were generally greater than ages inferred from ND dating; two of seven TE-derived ages agreed with FBD-obtained ages, the others were much younger or much older than ND or FBD ages. We favour the FBD-derived ages because they best match the Osmundales fossil record (including Triassic fossils not used in our study). Under the preferred model, the clade encompassing extant Osmundaceae (and many fossils) dates to the latest Palaeozoic to Early Triassic; divergences of the extant species occurred during the Neogene. Under the assumption of constant speciation and extinction rates, FBD yielded 0.0299 (0.0099--0.0549) and 0.0240 (0.0039--0.0495) for these rates, whereas neontological data yielded 0.0314 and 0.0339.

Unfortunately, the dearth of comparable historical data makes it much more difficult to study human mobility patterns from the past. In this paper, we present an analysis of long-term human migration, which is important for processes such as urbanization and the spread of ideas. We demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called ""jokbo"") can be used to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past 750 years. We apply two generative models of long-term human mobility to quantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage records in the data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions of the clans poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these models. Using the different geographical distributions of clans, we quantify the ""ergodicity"" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly they have spread across Korea, and we compare these results to those obtained using surname data from the Czech Republic. To examine population flow in more detail, we also construct and examine a population-flow network between regions.

We have recently described the distribution of fitness effects of all single mutations for a nine amino acid region of yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) implicated in substrate binding. Here, we report and discuss the distribution of intragenic epistatic effects within this region in seven Hsp90 point mutant backgrounds of neutral to slightly deleterious effect, resulting in an analysis of more than 1000 double-mutants. We find negative epistasis between substitutions to be common, and positive epistasis to be rare – resulting in a pattern that indicates a drastic change in the distribution of fitness effects one step away from the wild type. This can be well explained by a concave relationship between phenotype and genotype (i.e., a concave shape of the local fitness landscape), suggesting mutational robustness intrinsic to the local sequence space. Structural analyses indicate that, in this region, epistatic effects are most pronounced when a solvent-inaccessible position is involved in the interaction. In contrast, all 18 observations of positive epistasis involved at least one mutation at a solvent-exposed position.

Through comparative analysis of transcriptomic data, we show that a species’ testis expression profile, like testis size, can be a reliable indicator of mating type among primates, and possibly murids. Differential expression, in turn, largely reflects changes in the relative proportions of somatic/pre-meiotic versus meiotic/post-meiotic cell types. By studying mouse and macaque testis development, we find that single-male species’ testis expression profiles are paedomorphic relative to multi-male species’ profiles.

Such a region might be a critical node in the representation of vocal communication sounds, underlying the recognition of vocalization type, caller and social context. These results raise the questions of whether cortical specializations for vocalization processing exist in other species, their cortical location, and their relationship to the auditory processing hierarchy. To explore cortical specializations for vocalizations in another  species, we performed high-field fMRI of the auditory cortex of a vocal New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using a sparse imaging paradigm, we discovered a caudal-rostral gradient for the processing of conspecific vocalizations in marmoset auditory cortex, with regions of the anterior temporal lobe close to the temporal pole exhibiting the highest preference for vocalizations.

Dividing progenitor cells thus face a decision on whether their offspring shall differentiate or self-renew. This results in three possible modes of division (symmetric self-renewing, symmetric differentiating, and asymmetric) all of which have been observed in developing animal tissues. In some instances, the frequencies of occurrence of these division modes are incompatible with the possibility that sibling cells take the decision to differentiate independently of each other. Rather, an excess of symmetric divisions, both proliferating and differentiating, is usually observed in so far no general mechanism by which this fate entanglement takes place has been put forward. Here we propose a simple model of progenitor priming that provides a rationale on how the fate of sibling cells might be linked.

The reproducible procedure followed to derive this collection of bioclimatic indices is now presented. It required an integration of data-transformation modules (D-TM) using geospatial tools such as Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and array-based mathematical implementation such as semantic array programming (SemAP). Base variables, intermediate and final covariates are described and semantically defined by providing the workflow of D-TMs and the mathematical formulation following the SemAP notation. Source layers to derive base variables were extracted by exclusively relying on global-scale public open geodata in order for the same set of bioclimatic covariates to be reproducible in any region worldwide. In particular, two freely available datasets were exploited for temperature and precipitation (WorldClim) and elevation (Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data). The working extent covers the European continent to the Urals with a resolution of 30 arc-second. The proposed set of bioclimatic covariates will be made available as open data in the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC). The forthcoming complete set of D-TM codelets will enable the 12 covariates to be easily reproduced and expanded through free software.

Here we show that inhibiting DNA methylation impairs fiber development. Genome-wide methylcytosine-, mRNA-, and small RNA-sequencing analyses reveal minor changes in CG and CHG methylation and distinct changes in CHH methylation among different tissues. In ovules CHH hypermethyaltion is associated with small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and expression changes of nearby genes in euchromatin. Remarkably, ovule-derived fiber cells not only maintain euchromatic CHH methylation, but also generate additional heterochromatic CHH hypermethylation independent of RdDM, which represses transposable elements (TEs) and nearby genes including fiber-related genes. Furthermore, DNA methylation contributes to the expression bias of homoeologous genes in ovules and fibers. This spatiotemporal DNA methylation in promoters could act as a double-lock feedback mechanism to regulate TE and gene expression, which could be translated into genomic and biotechnological improvement of agronomic traits.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print285.pdf,"[( 27 Oct 2014 , 5), ( 28 Oct 2014 , 1)]"

With current sequencing methods we can sample genomes comprehensively. SNPs are found by aligning sequence reads against longer assembled references. De Bruijn graphs are efficient data structures that can deal with the vast amount of data from modern technologies. Recent work has shown that the topology of these graphs captures enough information to allow the detection and characterisation of genetic variants, offering an alternative to alignment-based methods. Such methods rely on depth-first walks of the graph to identify closing bifurcations. These methods are conservative or generate many false-positive results, particularly when traversing highly inter-connected (complex) regions of the graph or in regions of very high coverage. 
We devised an algorithm that calls SNPs in converted De Bruijn graphs by enumerating 2k + 2 cycles. We evaluated the accuracy of predicted SNPs by comparison with SNP lists from alignment based methods. We tested accuracy of the SNP calling using sequence data from sixteen ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and found that accuracy was high. We found that SNP calling was even across the genome and genomic feature types. Using sequence based attributes of the graph to train a decision tree allowed us to increase accuracy of SNP calls further.  Together these results indicate that our algorithm is capable of finding SNPs accurately in complex sub-graphs and potentially comprehensively from whole genome graphs.

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures.
Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens.
This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment.
Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem.
Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of  the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture.
The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time.

Identifying regulatory regions active during developmental transitions is necessary to understand how the genome specifies complex developmental programs and how these processes are disrupted in disease. Gene regulatory dynamics are mediated by many factors, including the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and the methylation and acetylation of DNA and histones. Genome-wide maps of TF binding and DNA and histone modifications have been generated for many cellular contexts; however, given the diversity and complexity of animal development, these data cover only a small fraction of the cellular and developmental contexts of interest. Thus, there is a need for methods that use existing epigenetic and functional genomics data to analyze the thousands of contexts that remain uncharacterized.

Results: To investigate the utility of histone modification data in the analysis of cellular contexts without such data, I evaluated how well genome-wide H3K27ac and H3K4me1 data collected in different developmental stages, tissues, and species were able to predict experimentally validated heart enhancers active at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in mouse.  Using a machine-learning approach to integrate the data from different contexts, I found that E11.5 heart enhancers can often be predicted accurately from data from other contexts, and I quantified the contribution of each data source to the predictions. The utility of each dataset correlated with nearness in developmental time and tissue to the target context: data from late developmental stages and adult heart tissues were most informative for predicting E11.5 enhancers, while marks from stem cells and early developmental stages were less informative. Predictions based on data collected in non-heart tissues and in human hearts were better than random, but worse than using data from mouse hearts.

Conclusions: The ability of these algorithms to accurately predict developmental enhancers based on data from related, but distinct, cellular contexts suggests that combining computational models with epigenetic data sampled from relevant contexts may be sufficient to enable functional characterization of many cellular contexts of interest.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics11.pdf,"[( 26 Oct 2014 , 13), ( 27 Oct 2014 , 1), ( 28 Oct 2014 , 2)]"

the immune system, like the Toll signalling pathway, are highly conserved. However, there is
also remarkable diversity. The chelicerates apparently lack the Imd signalling pathway and
BGRPs–a key class of pathogen recognition receptors. Many genes have large copy number
variation across species, and this may sometimes be accompanied by changes in function. For
example, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) have frequently lost their catalytic
activity and switch between secreted and intracellular forms. There has been extensive
duplication of the cellular immune receptor Dscam in several species, which may be an

Despite active experimental and computational research, the relationships among sequence, conservation, and function are still poorly understood.

Results: We compared transcription factor occupied segments (TFos) for 116 human and 35 mouse TFs in 546 human and 125 mouse cell types and tissues from the Human and the Mouse ENCODE projects. We based the map between human and mouse TFos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper, bnMapper, that utilizes whole genome alignments (WGA). 
Our analysis shows that TFos are under evolutionary constraint, but a substantial portion (25.1% of mouse and 25.85% of human on average) of the TFos does not have a homologous sequence on the other species; this portion varies among cell types and TFs. Furthermore, 47.67% and 57.01% of the homologous TFos sequence shows binding activity on the other species for human and mouse respectively. However, 79.87% and 69.22% is repurposed such that it binds the same TF in different cells or different TFs in the same cells. Remarkably, within the set of TFos not showing conservation of occupancy, the corresponding genome regions in the other species are preferred locations of novel TFos. These events suggest that a substantial amount of functional regulatory sequences is exapted from other biochemically active genomic material.

Despite substantial repurposing of TFos, we did not find substantial changes in their predicted target genes, suggesting that CRMs buffer evolutionary events allowing little or no change in the TF – target gene associations. Thus, the small portion of TFos with strictly conserved occupancy underestimates the degree of conservation of regulatory interactions.

Conclusion: We mapped regulatory sequences from an extensive number of TFs and cell types between human and mouse. A comparative analysis of this correspondence unveiled the extent of the shared regulatory sequence across TFs and cell types under study. Importantly, a large part of the shared regulatory sequence repurposed on the other species.

We first combined several tests that capture different signatures of selection to show that there is evidence of positive selection in the regions flanking FBti0019386 insertion. We then explored several phenotypes related to known phenotypic effects of nearby genes, and having plausible connections to fitness variation in nature. We found that flies with FBti0019386 insertion had a shorter developmental time and were more sensitive to stress, which are likely to be the adaptive effect and the cost of selection of this mutation, respectively. Interestingly, these phenotypic effects are not consistent with a role of FBti0019386 in temperate adaptation as has been previously suggested. Indeed, a global analysis of the population frequency of FBti0019386 showed that clinal frequency patterns are found in North America and Australia but not in Europe. Finally, we showed that FBti0019386 is associated with down-regulation of sra most likely because it induces the formation of heterochromatin by recruiting HP1a protein.

While the organization of the brain at large and intermediate scales had been well studied, the organization of neural tissue at micrometer scales remains largely unknown. In particular, at present it is not known what specific structures exist in neuropil at micrometer scales, what effect such structures have on formation of synaptic connectivity, and what processes shape the micrometer-scale organization of neuropil. In this work, we present an analysis of recent electron microscopy reconstructions of blocks of neuropil tissue from rat s. radiatum of hippocampal CA1 to provide insights into these questions. We propose a new statistical method for systematically analyzing the small-scale organization of neuropil based on an adaptation of the approach of radial distribution functions from statistical physics.

Consequently, emphasis has shifted to the use of alternative oyster reef materials, which need to be tested for their effectiveness as settlement substrate. Furthermore, low recruitment of wild larvae has also impeded restoration, indicating a need to assess the potential of field setting of cultured larvae. We experimentally examined oyster settlement, growth and survival on unconsolidated oyster shell, oyster shell embedded vertically in concrete, and concrete Oyster Castles® in field and mesocosm experiments. In addition, we examined settlement success of cultured larvae in the mesocosm experiment. In the field experiment, juvenile recruitment was 3x higher on castles and unconsolidated shell than on embedded shell. Castles retained 4x the number of oysters and hosted 5x the biomass than embedded shell, and retained 1.5x the oysters and hosted 3x the biomass than unconsolidated shell. The proportion of live oyster recruits on castles was 1.5x that on both embedded and unconsolidated shell. In the mesocosm experiment (90-d post-larval deployment), the castles recruited, retained, and hosted an oyster biomass 4x higher than that of unconsolidated and embedded shell. This study confirms that artificial reef materials such as Oyster Castles® are suitable alternative substrates for oyster restoration, and remote setting of larvae onto conditioned substrate can be effective under controlled environmental conditions.

Taking advantage of the large number of genes composing plant genomes and the wide range of variation in gene intron number, we performed a comprehensive survey of the patterns of variation in G+C content at different scales from the nucleotide level to the genome scale in two species Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, comparing the patterns in genes with different intron numbers. In both species, we observed a pervasive effect of gene intron number and location along genes on G+C content, codon and amino acid frequencies suggesting that in both species, introns have a barrier effect structuring G+C content along genes. In external gene regions (located upstream first or downstream last intron), species-specific factors are shaping G+C content while in internal gene regions (surrounded by introns), G+C content is constrained to remain within a range common to both species.

In this quest, taking into account neutral evolutionary processes such as mutation and genetic drift is crucial because these forces can generate patterns that may obscure or mimic signatures of selection. In mammals, and probably in many eukaryotes, another such confounding factor called GC-Biased Gene Conversion (gBGC) has been documented. This mechanism generates patterns identical to what is expected under selection for higher GC-content, specifically in highly recombining genomic regions. Recent results have suggested that a mysterious selective force favouring higher GC-content exists in Bacteria but the possibility that it could be gBGC has been excluded. Here, we show that gBGC is probably at work in most if not all bacterial species. First we find a consistent positive relationship between the GC-content of a gene and evidence of intra-genic recombination throughout a broad spectrum of bacterial clades. Second, we show that the evolutionary force responsible for this pattern is acting independently from selection on codon usage, and could potentially interfere with selection in favor of optimal AU-ending codons. A comparison with data from human populations shows that the intensity of gBGC in Bacteria is comparable to what has been reported in mammals. We propose that gBGC is not restricted to sexual Eukaryotes but also widespread among Bacteria and could therefore be an ancestral feature of cellular organisms. We argue that if gBGC occurs in bacteria, it can account for previously unexplained observations, such as the apparent non-equilibrium of base substitution patterns and the heterogeneity of gene composition within bacterial genomes. Because gBGC produces patterns similar to positive selection, it is essential to take this process into account when studying the evolutionary forces at work in bacterial genomes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Genetics/PLOS Genetics21.pdf,"[( 06 Nov 2014 , 3), ( 05 Nov 2014 , 19)]"

Here we provide experimental evidence for this game theoretic explanation in the context of the well-studied yeast GAL network.  In an environment containing the two sugars glucose and galactose, the yeast GAL network displays stochastic bimodal activation. We show that genetic mutants playing the ""pure"" strategies of GAL-ON or GAL-OFF can each invade the opposite strategy when rare, indicating a hawk-dove game between the two. Consistent with the Nash equilibrium of an evolutionary game, the stable mix of pure strategists does not necessarily maximize the growth of the overall population.

However, an emerging zooarcheological consensus depicts animal domestication as a long-term process without reproductive isolation or strong intentional selection. Here, we ask whether pig domestication followed a traditional linear model, or a complex, reticulate model as predicted by zooarcheologists. To do so, we fit models of domestication to whole genome data from over 100 wild and domestic pigs. We found that the assumptions of traditional models, such as reproductive isolation and strong domestication bottlenecks, are incompatible with the genetic data and provide support for the zooarcheological theory of a complex domestication process. In particular, gene-flow from wild to domestic pigs was a ubiquitous feature of the domestication of pigs. In addition, we show that despite gene-flow, the genomes of domestic pigs show strong signatures of selection at loci that affect behaviour and morphology. Specifically, our results are consistent with independent parallel sweeps in two independent domestication areas (China and Anatolia) at loci linked to morphological traits. We argue that recurrent selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenising effect of gene-flow from wild boars and created ""islands of domestication"" in the genome. Overall, our results suggest that genomic approaches that allow for more complex models of domestication to be embraced should be employed.

Therefore, a pharmacogenetic test is clinically useful if it identifies a group of patients for whom the agranulocytosis risk is low enough to alleviate monitoring requirements. Assuming a genotypic marker stratifies patients into a high risk and a low risk group, we explore the relationship between test sensitivity, group size and agranulocytosis risk.

Here we present a general statistical framework for assessing the adequacy of phylogenetic trait models.

Using naturally occurring and induced state transitions, we dissociated arousal and locomotion effects in V1. Arousal suppressed spontaneous firing and strongly altered the temporal patterning of population activity.

Our analyses identified four previously-implicated
loci (SORT1, APOE, LPA, and CETP) as containing variants that are very strongly associated with lipoprotein subfractions (log10 Bayes Factor > 15). Subsequent conditional analyses suggest that three of these (APOE, LPA and CETP) likely harbor multiple independently associated SNPs. Further, while different variants typically showed different characteristic patterns of association with combinations of subfractions, the two SNPs in CETP show strikingly similar patterns - both in our original data and in a replication cohort - consistent with a common underlying molecular mechanism. Notably, the CETP variants are very strongly associated with LDL subfractions, despite showing no association with total LDLs in our study, illustrating the potential value of the more detailed phenotypic measurements. In contrast with these strong subfraction associations, genetic association analysis of subfraction response to statins showed much weaker signals (none exceeding log10 Bayes Factor of 6). However, two SNPs (in APOE and LPA) previously-reported to be associated with LDL statin response do show some modest evidence for association in our data, and the subfraction response profiles at the LPA SNP are consistent with the LPA association, with response likely being due primarily to resistance of Lp(a) particles to statin therapy. An additional important feature of our analysis is that, unlike most previous analyses of multiple related phenotypes, we analyzed the subfractions jointly, rather than one at a time.

Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and vital to the services they provide. The essential role of microbes is due to high levels of functional diversity, which are, however, not always mirrored in morphological differentiation hampering their taxonomic identification. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders the measurement of morphological and behavioural traits at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals.
2. Recent advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital image analysis are promising approaches, however they miss out on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behaviour of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioural information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals.
3. We introduce bemovi, a package using R–the statistical computing environment–and the free image analysis software ImageJ. Bemovi is an automated digital video processing and analysis work flow to extract abundance and morphological and movement data for numerous individuals on a video, hence characterizing a population or community by multiple traits. Through a set of functions, bemovi identifies individuals present in a video and reconstruct their movement trajectories through space and time, merges measurements from all treated videos into a single database to which information on experimental conditions is added, readily available for further analysis in R.
4. We illustrate the validity, precision and accuracy of the method for experimental multi-species communities of protists in aquatic microcosms. We show the high correspondence between manual and automatic counts of individuals and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology and behaviour are constructed. We demonstrate how the data from videos can be used in combination with supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically classify individuals according to the species they belong to, and that information on movement behaviour can substantially improve the predictive ability and helps to distinguish morphologically similar species.

Therefore, integrating tumor genes and tumor markers with experimental evidences might definitely provide valuable information for further investigation of TGs and their crosstalk in cancer. To achieve this objective, we developed a database known as Cancer Gene Marker Database (CGMD) which integrates cancer genes and markers based on experimental background. The major goal of CGMD is to provide: 1) systemic treatment approaches and advancements of different cancer treatments in present scenario; 2) Pooling of different genes and markers with their molecular characterization and involvements in different pathways; 3) Free availability of CGMD at www.cgmd.in. The database consists of 309 genes plus 206 markers and also includes sequences of a list of 40 different human cancers and moreover, all the characterized markers have detailed descriptions in appropriate manner. CGMD extraction is collective and informative by using web resources like National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), UniProtKB, KEGG and EMBOSS.

Consequently, a major dichotomy in previously studied networks arises from modeling networks in terms of pairwise versus group tasks. The former often intrinsically give rise to scale-free, disassortative, hierarchical networks, whereas the latter often give rise to broad-scale, assortative, nonhierarchical networks. These dependencies explain contrasting observations among previous topological analyses of real world complex systems. We also observe this trend in systems with natural hierarchies, in which alternate representations of the same networks, but which capture different levels of the hierarchy, manifest these signature topological differences. For example, in both the Internet and cellular proteomes, networks of lower-level system components (routers within domains or proteins within biological processes) are assortative and nonhierarchical, whereas networks of upper-level system components (internet domains or biological processes) are disassortative and hierarchical.

This view is currently challenged by mounting evidence for structure in these phenomena: Trial-to-trial variability decreases following stimulus onset and can be predicted by previous spontaneous activity. This spontaneous activity is similar in magnitude and structure to evoked activity and can predict decisions. All of the observed neuronal properties described above can be accounted for, at an abstract computational level, by the sampling-hypothesis, according to which response variability reflects stimulus uncertainty. However, a mechanistic explanation at the level of neural circuit dynamics is still missing.

In this study, we demonstrate that all of these phenomena can be accounted for by a noise-free self-organizing recurrent neural network model (SORN). It combines spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic mechanisms in a deterministic network of excitatory and inhibitory McCulloch-Pitts neurons. The network self-organizes to spatio-temporally varying input sequences.

We find that the key properties of neural variability mentioned above develop in this model as the network learns to perform sampling-like inference. Importantly, the model shows high trial-to-trial variability although it is fully deterministic. This suggests that the trial-to-trial variability in neural recordings may not reflect intrinsic noise. Rather, it may reflect a deterministic approximation of sampling-like learning and inference. The simplicity of the model suggests that these correlates of the sampling theory are canonical properties of recurrent networks that learn with a combination of STDP and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology10.pdf,"[( 11 Nov 2014 , 7)]"

This has motivated the development of statistical phy- logenetic methods for detecting shifts in the rate of lineage diversification (speciation – extinction). One of the most frequently used methods—implemented in the program MEDUSA—explores a set of diversification-rate models, where each model uniquely assigns branches of the phylogeny to a set of one or more diversification-rate categories. Each candidate model is first fit to the data, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is then used to identify the optimal diversification model. Surprisingly, the statistical behavior of this popular method is completely unknown, which is a concern in light of the poor performance of the AIC as a means of choosing among models in other phylogenetic comparative contexts, and also because of the ad hoc algorithm used to visit models. Here, we perform an extensive simulation study demonstrating that, as implemented, MEDUSA (1) has an extremely high Type I error rate (on average, spurious diversification-rate shifts are identi- fied 42% of the time), and (2) provides severely biased parameter estimates (on average, estimated net-diversification and relative-extinction rates are 183% and 20% of their true values, respectively). We performed simulation experiments to reveal the source(s) of these pathologies, which include (1) the use of incorrect critical thresholds for model selection, and (2) errors in the likelihood function. Understanding the statistical behavior of MEDUSA is critical both to empirical researchers—in order to clarify whether these methods can reliably be applied to empirical datasets—and to theoretical biologists—in order to clarify whether new methods are required, and to reveal the specific problems that need to be solved in order to develop more reliable approaches for detecting shifts in the rate of lineage diversification.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print300.pdf,"[( 29 Jun 2015 , 2), ( 15 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 19 Nov 2014 , 3), ( 16 Nov 2014 , 4), ( 17 Nov 2014 , 3), ( 04 Jun 2015 , 1), ( 18 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 20 Jan 2015 , 3), ( 21 Jan 2015 , 1)]"

Genome scale surveys of human disease variation generate volumes of data that far exceed capabilities for laboratory characterization, and importantly also create a substantial burden of type I error. By incorporating a variety of functional annotations as predictors, such as regulatory and protein coding elements, statistical learning has been widely investigated as a mechanism for the prioritization of genetic variants that are more likely to be associated with complex disease. These methods offer a hope of identification of sufficiently large numbers of truly associated variants, to make cost-effective the large-scale functional characterization necessary to progress genome scale experiments. We compared the results from three published prioritization procedures which use different statistical learning algorithms and different predictors with regard to the quantity, type and coding of the functional annotations. In this paper we also explore different combinations of algorithm and annotation set. We train the models in 60% of the data and reserve the remainder for testing the accuracy. As an application, we tested which methodology performed the best for prioritizing sub-genome-wide-significant variants using data from the first and second rounds of a large schizophrenia meta-analysis by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Results suggest that all methods have considerable (and similar) predictive accuracies (AUCs 0.64-0.71). However, predictive accuracy results obtained from the test set do not always reflect results obtained from the application to the schizophrenia meta-analysis. In conclusion, a variety of algorithms and annotations seem to have a similar potential to effectively enrich true risk variants in genome scale datasets, however none offer more than incremental improvement in prediction.

Mathematical models describing biochemical processes on polymers are faced with various difficulties. First, polymer-active enzymes are often specific to some local configuration within the polymer but are indifferent to other features. That is they are potentially active on a large variety of different chemical compounds, meaning that polymers of different size and structure simultaneously compete for enzymes. Second, especially large polymers interact with each other and form

Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org) is an integrative resource organising, analysing and visualising genome-scale information for important crop and model plants. Available data includes reference genome sequence, variant loci, gene models and functional annotation. For variant loci, individual and population genotypes, linkage information and, where available, phenotypic information, are shown. Comparative analyses are performed on DNA and protein sequence alignments. The resulting genome alignments and gene trees, representing the implied evolutionary history the gene family, are made available for visualisation and analysis. Driven by the use case of bread wheat, specific extensions to the analysis pipelines and web interface have recently been developed to support polyploid genomes.

Data in Ensembl Plants is accessible through a genome browser incorporating various specialist interfaces for different data types, and through a variety of additional methods for programmatic access and data mining.

Previous studies of expansion load have focused on co-dominant mutations. An important consequence of this assumption is that expansion load stems exclusively from the accumulation of new mutations occurring in individuals living at the wave front. Using individual-based simulations we study here the dynamics of standing genetic variation at the front of expansions, and its consequences on mean fitness if mutations are recessive. We find that deleterious genetic diversity is quickly lost at the front of the expansion, but the loss of deleterious mutations at some loci is compensated by an increase of their frequencies at other loci. The frequency of deleterious homozygotes therefore increases along the expansion axis whereas the average number of deleterious mutations per individual remains nearly constant across the species range. This reveals two important differences to co-dominant models: (i) mean fitness at the front of the expansion drops much faster if mutations are recessive, and (ii) mutation load can increase during the expansion even if the total number of deleterious mutations per individual remains constant. We use our model to make predictions about the shape of the site frequency spectrum at the front of range expansion, and about correlations between heterozygosity and fitness in different parts of the species range. Importantly, these predictions provide opportunities to empirically validate our theoretical results. We discuss our findings in the light of recent results on the distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations, and link them to empirical results on the correlation of heterozygosity and fitness found in many natural range expansions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Molecular Ecology/Molecular Ecology5.pdf,"[( 20 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 19 Nov 2014 , 18), ( 04 Dec 2014 , 3)]"

The contribution of identified mutations in the tolerant strain was evaluated by using site-directed mutagenesis, which suggested that the fixation of these mutations cannot fully explain the observed ethanol tolerance.

We find that such a ""stability model"" generally performs well, displaying correlations between predicted and empirically observed rates of up to 0.75 for some proteins. We further find that our model has comparable predictive power as does an alternative, recently proposed ""stress model"" that explains evolutionary-rate variation among sites in terms of the excess energy needed for mutants to adopt the correct active structure (ΔΔG*).

Mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. One of the suggested explanations is the activity of error-prone DNA polymerases in late-replicating regions. Polymerase ζ (pol ζ), an essential error-prone polymerase biased towards transversions, also has a tendency to produce dinucleotide mutations (DNMs), complex mutational events that simultaneously affect two adjacent nucleotides. Experimental studies have shown that pol ζ is strongly biased towards GC->AA/TT DNMs. Using primate divergence data, we show that the GC->AA/TT pol ζ mutational signature is the most frequent among DNMs, and its rate exceeds the mean rate of other DNM types by a factor of ~10. Unlike the overall rate of DNMs, the pol ζ signature drastically increases with the replication time in the human genome. Finally, the pol ζ signature is enriched in transcribed regions, and there is a strong prevalence of GC->TT over GC->AA DNMs on the non-template strand, indicating association with transcription. A recurrently occurring GC->TT DNM in HRAS gene causes the Costello syndrome; we find a 2-fold increase in the mutation rate, and a 2-fold decrease in the transition/transversion ratio, at distances of up to 1 kb from the DNM, suggesting a link between the Costello syndrome and pol ζ activity.

We aimed to assess the effect of potential comorbidity of ID on the diagnosis and prevalence of autism by analyzing 11 years of special education enrollment data.

Design: Population study of autism using the United States special education enrollment data from years 2000-2010.
 
Setting: US special education.

Participants: We analyzed 11 years (2000 to 2010) of longitudinal data on approximately 6.2 million children per year from special education enrollment.

Results: We found a 331% increase in the prevalence of autism from 2000 to 2010 within special education, potentially due to a diagnostic recategorization from frequently comorbid features like ID.  In fact, the decrease in ID prevalence equaled an average of 64.2% of the increase of autism prevalence for children aged 3-18 years.  The proportion of ID cases potentially undergoing recategorization to autism was higher (p=0.007) among older children (75%) than younger children (48%).  Some US states showed significant negative correlations between the prevalence of autism compared to that of ID while others did not, suggesting differences in state-specific health policy to be a major factor in categorizing autism. 

Conclusions:  Our results suggest that current ascertainment practices are based on a single facet of autism-specific clinical features and do not consider associated comorbidities that may confound diagnosis.  Longitudinal studies with detailed phenotyping and deep molecular genetic analyses are necessary to completely understand the cause of this complex disorder.

Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy.

These findings have received widespread attention, and many have perceived Gire et al.'s results as implying rapid adaptation of EBOV to humans during the current outbreak. Here, we argue that, on the contrary, sequence divergence in EBOV is rather limited, and that the currently available data contain no robust signal of particularly rapid evolution or adaptation to humans. The doubled substitution rate can be attributed entirely to the application of a molecular-clock model to a population of sequences with minimal divergence and segregating polymorphisms.

Here we document the influence of active hunters (zebra jumping spiders, Salticus scenicus) and ambush predators (Chinese praying mantids, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis) on the capture deterrence anti-predatory behavioural repertoire of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that D. melanogaster would reduce overall locomotory activity in the presence of ambush predators, and increase them with active hunters. First we observed and described the behavioural repertoire of D. melanogaster in the presence of the predators.  We documented three previously undescribed behaviours- abdominal lifting, stopping and retreat- which were performed at higher frequency by D. melanogaster in the presence of predators, and may aid in capture deterrence. Consistent with our predictions, we observed an increase in the overall activity of D. melanogaster in the presence of jumping spiders (active hunter).

The present study examines to which extent the habituation time to the test cage as well as the shape / size of the cage influence social communication in freely interacting mice. We tested 8 pairs of male mice in free dyadic social interactions, with two habituation times (20 min and 30 min) and three cage formats (rectangle, round, square). We tested the effect of these conditions on the different types of social contacts, approach-escape sequences, follow behavior, and the time each animal spent in the vision field of the other one, as well as on the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations and their contexts of emission. We provide for the first time an integrated analysis of the social interaction behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations. Surprisingly, we did not highlight any significant effect of habituation time and cage shape / size on the behavioral events examined. There was only a slight increase of social interactions with the longer habituation time in the round cage. Remarkably, we also showed that vocalizations were emitted during specific behavioral sequences especially during close contact or approach behaviors.

In the present work we introduce FlexAID, a small-molecule docking algorithm that accounts for target side-chain flexibility and utilizes a soft scoring function, i.e. one that is not highly dependent on specific geometric criteria, based on surface complementarity. The pairwise energy parameters were derived from a large dataset of true positive poses and negative decoys from the PDBbind dataset through an iterative process using Monte Carlo simulations. The prediction of binding poses is tested using the independent Astex dataset while performance in virtual screening is evaluated using a subset of the DUD dataset. We compare FlexAID to AutoDock Vina, FlexX, and rDock in an extensive number of scenarios to understand the strengths and limitations of the different programs as well as to reported results for Glide, GOLD and DOCK6 where applicable. The most relevant among these scenarios is that of docking on flexible non native-complex structures where as is the case in reality, the target conformation in the bound form is not known a priori. We demonstrate that FlexAID, unlike other programs, is robust against increasing structural variability. FlexAID obtains equivalent sampling success as GOLD and performs better than AutoDock Vina or FlexX in all scenarios against non native- complex structures. FlexAID is better than rDock when there is at least one critical side-chain movement required upon ligand binding. In virtual screening, FlexAID rescored results are comparable to those of AutoDock Vina and rDock.

Theory suggests that non-recombining sex-linked regions should quickly spread, eventually becoming heteromorphic chromosomes. In contrast, we show using whole genome scans that the sex-associated region in P. trichocarpa is small and much younger than the age of the genus. This indicates that sex-determination is highly labile in poplar, consistent with recent evidence of “turnover” of sex determination regions in animals. We performed whole genome resequencing of 52 Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood) and 34 P. balsamifera (balsam poplar) individuals of known sex. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in these unstructured populations identified 650 SNPs significantly associated with sex. We estimate the size of the sex-linked region to be ∼100 Kbp. All significant SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium despite the fact that they were mapped to six different chromosomes (plus 3 unmapped scaffolds) in version 2.2 of the reference genome. We show that this is likely due to genome misassembly. The segregation pattern of sex associated SNPs revealed this to be an XY sex determining system. Estimated divergence times of X and Y haplotype sequences (6-7 MYA) are much more recent than the divergence of P. trichocarpa (poplar) and P. tremuloides (aspen). Consistent with this, in P. tremuloides we found no XY haplotype divergence within the P. trichocarpa sex-determining region.

Massive parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation.

We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package CNVkit, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: GC content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of CNVkit to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of CNVkit so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for compatibility with other software.

CENTIPEDE, a powerful, probabilistic framework for identifying transcription factor binding sites from tissue-specific DNase I cleavage patterns and genomic sequence content, leverages the hypersensitivity of factor-bound chromatin and the information in the DNase I spatial cleavage profile characteristic of each DNA binding protein to accurately infer functional factor binding sites. However, the model for the spatial profile in this framework underestimates the substantial variation in the DNase I cleavage profiles across factor-bound genomic locations and across replicate measurements of chromatin accessibility.

Results: In this work, we adapt a multi-scale modeling framework for inhomogeneous Poisson processes to better model the underlying variation in DNase I cleavage patterns across genomic locations bound by a transcription factor. In addition to modeling variation, we also model spatial structure in the heterogeneity in DNase I cleavage patterns for each factor. Using DNase-seq measurements assayed in a lymphoblastoid cell line, we demonstrate the improved performance of this model for several transcription factors by comparing against the Chip-Seq peaks for those factors. Finally, we propose an extension to this framework that allows for a more flexible background model and evaluate the additional gain in accuracy achieved when the background model parameters are estimated using DNase-seq data from naked DNA. The proposed model can also be applied to paired-end ATAC-seq and DNase-seq data in a straightforward manner.

Recently, consecutive studies on manual asymmetries in bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata [Mangalam et al., 2014a; Mangalam et al., 2014b] revealed both the functional and the adaptive significance of manual asymmetries respectively, and pointed towards the division of labor as being the general principle underlying the observed hand-usage patterns. We review the studies on manual asymmetries in capuchin monkeys, Cebus spp. and argue that the observed hand-usage patterns might reflect specialization of the two hands for accomplishing tasks that require different dexterity types (i.e., maneuvering in three dimensional space or physical strength). To this end, we do a step-by-step analysis of the various tasks used in the studies on manual asymmetries in capuchin monkeys, wherein we: (a) analyze the different manual tasks that have been used to study manual asymmetries in non-human primates on the basis of the attributes such as the number of hands required to solve a given task (i.e., unimanual, pseudo unimanual, or bimanual) and the spatiotemporal progression of manual actions (i.e., sequential or concurrent).

This paper proposes a semi-quantitative integrated methodology for a robust assessment of soil erosion rates in data poor regions affected by landslide activity. It combines heuristic, empirical and probabilistic approaches. This proposed methodology is based on the geospatial semantic array programming paradigm and has been implemented on a catchment scale methodology using GIS spatial analysis tools and GNU Octave. The integrated data-transformation model relies on a modular architecture, where the information flow among modules is constrained by semantic checks. In order to improve computational reproducibility, the geospatial data transformations implemented in ESRI ArcGis are made available in the free software GRASS GIS.

This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele-frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises when attempting to discover variants and genotype the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in cases where low-coverage population data are given, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical. Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging linkage disequilibrium that deviates from previous Markov-based models.

As a consequence it is often difficult to determine whether demographic events such as expansions or contractions (bottlenecks) inferred from genetic data are real or due to the fact that populations are structured in nature. Given that few inferential methods allow us to account for that structure, and that genomic data will necessarily increase the precision of parameter estimates, it is important to develop new approaches.

Specific biochemical processes and associated biomolecules that differentiate various tissues are not completely understood, neither is the extent to which a unicellular organism, such as yeast, can be used to model these processes within each tissue. 

We propose a novel computational and statistical framework to systematically quantify the suitability of yeast as a model organism for different human tissues. We develop a computational method for dissecting the human interactome into tissue-specific cellular networks. Using these networks, we simultaneously partition the functional space of human genes, and their corresponding pathways, based on their conservation both across species and among different tissues. We study these sub-spaces in detail, and relate them to the overall similarity of each tissue with yeast. 

Many complex disorders are driven by a coupling of housekeeping (universally expressed in all tissues) and tissue-selective (expressed only in specific tissues) dysregulated pathways. We show that human-specific subsets of tissue-selective genes are significantly associated with the onset and development of a number of pathologies. Consequently, they provide excellent candidates as drug targets for therapeutic interventions.

Sexual selection theory predicts that SSD should increase as one sex competes more fiercely for access to mates, but it is unclear what effect spatial variation in ecology may have on this behavioral process. Here, we examine SSD across the class Aves in a spatial and phylogenetic framework, and test several a priori hypotheses regarding its relationship with climate. We mapped the global distribution of SSD from published descriptions of body size, distribution, and phylogenetic relationships across 2581 species of birds. We examined correlations between SSD and nine predictor variables representing a priori models of physical geography, climate, and climate variability. Our results show guarded support for a global latitudinal trend in SSD based on a weak prevalence of species with low or female-biased SSD in the North, but substantial spatial heterogeneity. While several stronger relationships were observed between SSD and climate predictors within zoogeographical regions, no global relationship emerged that was consistent across multiple methods of analysis. While we found support for a global relationship between climate and SSD, this support lacked consistency and explanatory power. Furthermore the strong phylogenetic signal and conspicuous lack of support from phylogenetically corrected analyses suggests that any such relationship in birds is likely due to the idiosyncratic histories of different lineages. In this manner, our results broadly agree with studies in other groups, leading us to conclude that the relationship between climate and SSD is at best complex.

When offered two different sugars as carbon sources, microorganisms first consume the preferred sugar, then undergo a transient growth delay, the “diauxic lag”, while inducing genes to metabolize the less preferred sugar. This delay is commonly assumed to be an inevitable consequence of selection to maximize use of the preferred sugar. Contrary to this view, we found that many natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae display short or non-existent diauxic lags when grown in mixtures of glucose (preferred) and galactose. These strains induce galactose-utilization (GAL) genes hours before glucose exhaustion, thereby “preparing” for the transition from glucose to galactose metabolism. The extent of preparation varies across strains, and seems to be determined by the steady-state response of GAL genes to mixtures of glucose and galactose rather than by induction kinetics. Although early GAL induction gives strains a competitive advantage once glucose runs out, it comes at a cost while glucose is still present. Costs and benefits correlate with the degree of preparation: strains with higher expression of GAL genes prior to glucose exhaustion experience a larger upfront growth cost but also a shorter diauxic lag. Our results show that classical diauxic growth is only one extreme on a continuum of growth strategies constrained by a cost-benefit tradeoff. This type of continuum is likely to be common in nature, as similar tradeoffs can arise whenever cells evolve to use mixtures of nutrients.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Biology/PLOS Biology3.pdf,"[( 04 Dec 2014 , 3)]"

We analyzed three GWAS of hair color, tanning ability and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in European Americans (sample size from 7,440 to 9,822) and considered two widely used polygenic prediction approaches: polygenic risk scores (PRS) and Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP).

Surprisingly, explicitly modeling ancestry produces a similar improvement when using the BLUP approach, which fits all SNPs simultaneously in a single variance component and causes ancestry to be under-weighted. We validate our findings via simulations, which show that the differences in prediction accuracy will increase in magnitude as sample sizes increase.

Empirical phylogenetic studies often implement coalescent based species tree methods to avoid the anomaly zone, but to this point these studies have not had a method for providing any direct evidence that the species tree is actually in the anomaly zone. In this study, we use 16 species of lizards in the family Scincidae to investigate whether nodes that are difficult to resolve are located within the anomaly zone.

With a modeling approach that combines real world weather and climate data to simulate temperature preference-dependent survival and reproduction, we find that a bet-hedging strategy may underlie the observed inter-individual behavioral diversity. Specifically, bet-hedging outcompetes strategies in which individual thermal preferences are heritable. Animals employing bet-hedging refrain from adapting to the coolness of spring with increased warm-seeking that inevitably becomes counterproductive in the hot summer. This strategy is particularly valuable when mean seasonal temperatures are typical, or when there is considerable fluctuation in temperature within the season.

The archetypal example of reproductive altruism, honey bee reproductive caste, involves strict social regulation of larval caste fate by care-giving nurses. However, the contribution of nurse-expressed genes, which are prime socially-acting candidate genes, to the caste developmental program and to caste evolution remains mostly unknown. We experimentally induced new queen production by removing the current colony queen, and we used RNA sequencing to study the gene expression profiles of both developing larvae and their care-giving nurses before and after queen removal. By comparing the gene expression profiles between both queen-destined larvae and their nurses to worker-destined larvae and their nurses in queen-present and queen-absent conditions, we identified larval and nurse genes associated with larval caste development and with queen presence. Of 950 differentially-expressed genes associated with larval caste development, 82% were expressed in larvae and 18% were expressed in nurses. Behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that nurses may specialize in the short term feeding queen- versus worker-destined larvae. Estimated selection coefficients indicated that both nurse and larval genes associated with caste are rapidly evolving, especially those genes associated with worker development. Of the 1863 differentially-expressed genes associated with queen presence, 90% were expressed in nurses. Altogether, our results suggest that socially-acting genes play important roles in both the expression and evolution of socially-influenced traits like caste.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print321.pdf,"[( 08 Dec 2014 , 4), ( 09 Dec 2014 , 2)]"

This is of course also well-appreciated by comparative biologists. However, unlike in quantitative genetics, most of the statistical and conceptual tools for analyzing phylogenetic comparative data (recently reviewed in Pennell and Harmon, 2013) are designed for analyzing a single trait (but see, for example Revell and Harmon, 2008; Revell and Harrison, 2008; Hohenlohe and Arnold, 2008; Revell and Collar, 2009; Schmitz and Motani, 2011; Adams, 2014b).

After training, a brief cue can trigger a spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity similar to that evoked by a learned stimulus sequence. Network models show that such sequence learning can occur through the shaping of feedforward excitatory connectivity via long term plasticity. Previous models describe how event order can be learned, but they typically do not explain how precise timing can be recalled. We propose a mechanism for learning both the order and precise timing of event sequences. In our recurrent network model, long term plasticity leads to the learning of the sequence, while short term facilitation enables temporally precise replay of events. Learned synaptic weights between populations determine the time necessary for one population to activate another. Long term plasticity adjusts these weights so that the trained event times are matched during playback. While we chose short term facilitation as a time-tracking process, we also demonstrate that other mechanisms, such as spike rate adaptation, can fulfill this role. We also analyze the impact of trial-to-trial variability, showing how observational errors as well as neuronal noise result in variability in learned event times. The dynamics of the playback process determine how stochasticity is inherited in learned sequence timings.

Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation. Currently, it is up to the subject matter experts, for example biologists, to determine if the stated assumptions are appropriate or not.

We extend the model to take into account changing population sizes, which result from the antagonistic nature of the interaction and follow the Lotka-Volterra equations. Under this extension, the population dynamics become most complex as the model moves away from pure matching-allele and becomes more gene-for-gene-like. While the population densities oscillate with a single oscillation frequency in the pure matching-allele model, a second oscillation frequency arises under gene-for-gene-like conditions. These observations hold for general interaction parameters and allow to infer generic patterns of the dynamics.

Previous studies using genomics assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based assays have identified many types of regulatory domains.  However, due to the difficulty of integrating genomics data sets, the relationships among these domain types are poorly understood.  Semi-automated genome annotation (SAGA) algorithms facilitate human interpretation of heterogeneous collections of genomics data by simultaneously partitioning the human genome and assigning labels to the resulting genomic segments.  However, existing SAGA methods can incorporate only data sets that can be expressed as a one-dimensional vector over the genome and therefore cannot integrate inherently pairwise chromatin conformation data.  We developed a new computational method, called graph-based regularization (GBR), for expressing a pairwise prior that encourages certain pairs of genomic loci to receive the same label in a genome annotation.  We used GBR to exploit chromatin conformation information during genome annotation by encouraging positions that are close in 3D to occupy the same type of domain.  Using this approach, we produced a comprehensive model of chromatin domains in eight human cell types, thereby revealing the relationships among known domain types.  Through this model, we identified clusters of tightly-regulated genes expressed in only a small number of cell types, which we term ""specific expression domains."" We additionally found that a subset of domain boundaries marked by promoters and CTCF motifs are consistent between cell types even when domain activity changes.

Strikingly, we find that autosomal introgression has occurred from contemporary hybridization among A. gambiae and A. arabiensis despite strong divergence (~5? higher than autosomal divergence) and isolation on the X chromosome.  We find a large region of the X chromosome that has swept to fixation in the GOUNDRY subgroup within the last 100 years, which may be an inversion that serves as a partial barrier to contemporary gene flow.

Furthermore, geographic locations of taxa can be shown on a map, making it easy to visually check there is some geographic pattern in a phylogeny. Taxa orderings have a large impact on the layout of the tree set, and advances have been made in finding better orderings resulting in significantly more informative visualisations.

It also provides opportunities to identify genes and pathways that may have been influenced by non-neutral processes. Here we use a population genetics framework and next generation sequencing to evaluate how gene expression variation is apportioned among four human groups in a natural biological tissue, the placenta.
Results: We estimate that on average, 33.2%, 58.9% and 7.8% of the placental transcriptome is explained by variation within individuals, among individuals and among human groups, respectively.  Additionally, when technical and biological traits are included in models of gene expression they account for roughly 2% of total gene expression variation. Notably, the variation that is significantly different among groups is enriched in biological pathways associated with immune response, cell signaling and metabolism. Many biological traits demonstrated correlated changes in expression in numerous pathways of potential interest to clinicians and evolutionary biologists. Finally, we estimate that the majority of the human placental transcriptome (65% of expressed genes) exhibits expression profiles consistent with neutrality; the remainder are consistent with stabilizing selection (26%), directional selection (4.9%), or diversifying selection (4.8%).

Because registrants reported differences in steroid and other medication usage, as well as age and ambulation status, we could explore these data for correlations with age at loss of ambulation. Using multivariate analysis, current steroid usage was the most significant and largest independent predictor of improved wheelchair-free survival. Thus, these online self-report data were sufficient to retrospectively observe that current steroid use by patients with DMD is associated with a delay in loss of ambulation. Comparing commonly used steroid drugs, deflazacort prolonged ambulation longer than prednisone (median 14 years and 13 years, respectively). Further, use of Vitamin D and Coenzyme Q10, insurance status, and age at diagnosis after 4 years were also significant, but smaller, independent predictors of longer wheelchair-free survival. Nine other common supplements were also individually tested but had lower study power. This study demonstrates the utility of DuchenneConnect data to observe therapeutic differences, and highlights needs for improvement in quality and quantity of patient-report data, which may allow exploration of drug/therapeutic practice combinations impractical to study in clinical trial settings.

In addition, details relating to the proce- dures used to obtain the published results can be difficult to discern due to the use of natural language when reporting how experiments have been performed. The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA), Nanop- ublications (NP) and Research Objects (RO) models are conceptual data modelling frameworks that can structure such information from scientific papers. Computational workflow platforms can also be used to reproduce analyses of data in a principled manner. We assessed the extent by which ISA, NP and RO models, together with the Galaxy workflow system, can capture the experimental processes and reproduce the findings of a previously published paper reporting on the development of SOAPdenovo2, a de novo genome assembler.
Results: Executable workflows were developed using Galaxy which reproduced results that were con- sistent with the published findings. A structured representation of the information in the SOAPdenovo2 paper was produced by combining the use of ISA, NP and RO models. By structuring the information in the published paper using these data and scientific workflow modelling frameworks, it was possible to explicitly declare elements of experimental design, variables and findings. The models served as guides in the curation of scientific information and this led to the identification of inconsistencies in the original published paper, thereby allowing its authors to publish corrections in the form of an errata.

However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.
We present QuASAR, Quantitative Allele Specific Analysis of Reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls while including parameters that model base-call errors in sequencing and allelic over-dispersion.

They specify the identity of segments along the anterior-posterior body axis in metazoans by controlling the expression of diverse downstream targets, including transcription factors and signaling pathway components. The Drosophila melanogaster Hox factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) directs the development of thoracic and abdominal segments and appendages, and loss of Ubx function can lead for example to the transformation of third thoracic segment appendages (e.g. halters) into second thoracic segment appendages (e.g. wings), resulting in a characteristic four-wing phenotype. Here we present a Drosophila melanogaster strain with a V5-epitope tagged Ubx allele, which we employed to obtain a high quality genome-wide map of Ubx binding sites using ChIP-seq. We confirm the sensitivity of the V5 ChIP-seq by recovering 7/8 of well-studied Ubx-dependent cis-regulatory regions. Moreover, we show that Ubx binding is predictive of enhancer activity as suggested by comparison with a genome-scale resource of in vivo tested enhancer candidates. We observed densely clustered Ubx binding sites at 12 extended genomic loci that included ANTP-C, BX-C, Polycomb complex genes, and other regulators and the clustered binding sites were frequently active enhancers. Furthermore, Ubx binding was detected at known Polycomb response elements (PREs) and was associated with significant enrichments of Pc and Pho ChIP signals in contrast to binding sites of other developmental TFs.  Together, our results show that Ubx targets developmental regulators via strongly clustered binding sites and allow us to hypothesize that regulation by Ubx might involve Polycomb group proteins to maintain specific regulatory states in cooperative or mutually exclusive fashion, an attractive model that combines two groups of proteins with prominent gene regulatory roles during animal development.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE48.pdf,"[( 03 May 2015 , 1), ( 13 Dec 2014 , 2), ( 12 Dec 2014 , 15)]"

Two important derivations will be the translation of this information into a multiscale understanding of pathogenic variants, and leveraging existing data to increase the power of existing and future studies through prioritization. We explore edge prediction on heterogeneous networks—graphs with multiple node and edge types—for accomplishing both tasks. First we constructed a network with 18 node types—genes, diseases, tissues, pathophysiologies, and 14 MSigDB (molecular signatures database)collections—and 19 edge types from high-throughput publicly-available resources. From this network composed of 40,343 nodes and 1,608,168 edges, we extracted features that describe the topology between specific genes and diseases. Next, we trained a model from GWAS associations and predicted the probability of association between each protein-coding gene and each of 29 well-studied complex diseases. The model, which achieved 132-fold enrichment in precision at 10% recall, outperformed any individual domain, highlighting the benefit of integrative approaches. We identified pleiotropy, transcriptional signatures of perturbations, pathways, and protein interactions as fundamental mechanisms explaining pathogenesis. Our method successfully predicted the results (with AUROC = 0.79) from a withheld multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS despite starting with only 13 previously associated genes. Finally, we combined our network predictions with statistical evidence of association to propose four novel MS genes, three of which (JAK2, REL, RUNX3) validated on the masked GWAS.

Since biological systems such as breast cancer tumors respond differently to various treatments, little is known about exactly how these gene regulatory networks (GRNs) operate under different stimuli. For example, when we apply a drug-induced perturbation to a target protein, we often only know that the dynamic response of the specific protein may be affected. We do not know by how much, how long and even whether this perturbation affects other proteins or not. Challenges due to the lack of such knowledge not only occur in modeling the dynamics of a GRN but also cause bias or uncertainties in identifying parameters or inferring the GRN structure. This paper describes a new algorithm which enables us to estimate bias error due to the effect of perturbations and correctly identify the common graph structure among biased inferred graph structures. To do this, we retrieve common dynamics of the GRN subject to various perturbations. We refer to the task as ""repairing"" inspired by ""image repairing"" in computer vision. The method can automatically correctly repair the common graph structure across perturbed GRNs, even without precise information about the effect of the perturbations. We evaluate the method on synthetic data sets and demonstrate advantages over l1-regularized graph inference by advancing our understanding of how these networks respond across different targeted therapies.

Further comparative genomic analysis indicates that polycistronic transcription is likely a feature unique to these fungi. In addition, we also systematically demonstrated that short-read assembly is insufficient for mRNA isoform discovery, especially for isoform-rich loci. In summary, our study revealed, for the first time, the genome prevalence of polycistronic transcription in a subset of fungi.

None of the available approaches so far have simultaneously co-estimated all the relevant parameters in the model, without restricting the parameter space by requiring a guide tree and/or prior assignment of individuals to clusters or species.  
Results: We present DISSECT, which explores the full space of possible clusterings of individuals and species tree topologies in a Bayesian framework. It uses an approximation to avoid the need for reversible-jump MCMC, in the form of a prior that is a modification of the birth-death prior for the species tree. It incorporates a spike near zero in the density for node heights. The model has two extra parameters: one controls the degree of approximation, and the second controls the prior distribution on the numbers of species. It is implemented as part of BEAST and requires only a few changes from a standard *BEAST analysis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and demonstrated on an empirical data set. The method is shown to be insensitive to the degree of approximation, but quite sensitive to the second parameter, suggesting that large numbers of sequences are needed to draw firm conclusions.

Recently, attention has turned to understanding the behaviour of cells in crowded environments. In such scenarios it is possible for cells to interact mechanistically, inducing neighbouring cells to move in order to make room for their own movements or progeny. Although the behaviour of interacting cells has been modelled extensively through volume-exclusion processes, no models, thus far, have explicitly accounted for the ability of cells to actively displace each other. 

In this work we consider both on and off-lattice volume-exclusion position-jump processes in which cells are explicitly allowed to induce movements in their near neighbours in order to create space for themselves (which we refer to as pushing). From these simple individual-level representations we derive continuum partial differential equations for the average occupancy of the domain. We find that, for limited amounts of pushing, the comparison between the averaged individual-level simulations and the population-level model is nearly as good as in the scenario without pushing but, that for larger and more complicated pushing events the assumptions used to derive the population-level model begin to break down. Interestingly, we find that, in the on-lattice case, the diffusion coefficient of the population-level model is increased by pushing, whereas, for the particular off-lattice model that we investigate, the diffusion coefficient is reduced. We conclude therefore, that it is important to consider carefully the appropriate individual-level model to use when representing complex cell-cell interactions such as pushing.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Physical Review E/Physical Review E2.pdf,"[( 10 Dec 2014 , 9), ( 07 Jan 2015 , 2), ( 09 Dec 2014 , 1)]"

Structurally, the segments are contained within micro-domains delineated by known nucleoid-associated proteins, and they contain operons with specific relative orientations. Functionally, the operons within a same segment are highly co-transcribed, even in the absence of regulatory factors at their promoter regions. Hence, operons with no common regulatory factor can be co-regulated if they share a regulatory factor at the level of segments.

Here, we present a framework for calculating the exact solution of a linear reaction?diffusion PDE on a growing domain.

Furthermore, our examples illustrate a delicate interplay between: (i) the rate at which the domain elongates, (ii) the diffusivity associated with the spreading density profile, (iii) the reaction rate, and (iv) the initial condition. Altering the balance between these four features leads to different outcomes in terms of whether an initial profile, located near $x=0$, eventually overcomes the domain growth and colonizes the entire length of the domain by reaching the boundary where $x = L(t)$.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE50.pdf,"[( 06 Nov 2014 , 2), ( 17 Dec 2014 , 1)]"

Plant breeding programs are characterized by a high degree of structuring, particularly into populations. This hampers establishment of large estimation sets for each population. Pooling populations increases estimation set size but ignores unique genetic characteristics of each. A possible solution is partial pooling with multilevel models, which allows estimating population specific marker effects while still leveraging information across populations. We developed a Bayesian multilevel whole-genome regression model and compared its performance to that of the popular BayesA model applied to each population separately (no pooling) and to the joined data set (complete pooling). As example we analyzed a wide array of traits from the nested association mapping maize population. There we show that for small population sizes (e.g., < 50), partial pooling increased prediction accuracy over no or complete pooling for populations represented in the estimation set. No pooling was superior however when populations were large. In another example data set of interconnected biparental maize populations either partial or complete pooling were superior, depending on the trait. A simulation showed that no pooling is superior when differences in genetic effects among populations are large and partial pooling when they are intermediate. With small differences, partial and complete pooling achieved equally high accuracy. For prediction of new populations, partial and complete pooling had very similar accuracy in all cases.

We have investigated the HSFY family in domestic pigs, and other suid species including warthogs, bushpigs, babirusas and peccaries.

Group B Sox proteins are a highly conserved group of transcription factors that act extensively to coordinate nervous system development in higher metazoans while showing both co-expression and functional redundancy across a broad group of taxa. In Drosophila melanogaster, the two group B Sox proteins Dichaete and SoxNeuro show widespread common binding across the genome. While some instances of functional compensation have been observed in Drosophila, the function of common binding and the extent of its evolutionary conservation is not known.
Results:
We used DamID-seq to examine the genome-wide binding patterns of Dichaete and SoxNeuro in four species of Drosophila. Through a quantitative comparison of Dichaete binding, we evaluated the rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites. We also examined the presence of Sox motifs within binding intervals and the correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation. To determine whether common binding between Dichaete and SoxNeuro is conserved, we performed a detailed analysis of the binding patterns of both factors in two species.  
Conclusion:
We find that, while the regulatory networks driven by Dichaete and SoxNeuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance. Nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites. We observed the strongest binding conservation at sites that are commonly bound by Dichaete and SoxNeuro, suggesting that these sites are functionally important. Our analysis provides insights into the evolution of group B Sox function, highlighting the specific conservation of shared binding sites and suggesting alternative sources of neofunctionalisation between paralogous family members.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics14.pdf,"[( 27 Mar 2015 , 4), ( 18 Dec 2014 , 20), ( 23 Dec 2014 , 1), ( 17 Dec 2014 , 3)]"

However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole-genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc, and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species.

If ecology is to be incorporated into models of population genetics, then it is important to represent accurately the functional form of frequency-dependent interactions. However, measuring this functional form is problematic for traditional fitness assays, which assume a constant fitness difference between competitors over the course of an assay. Here, we present a theoretical framework for measuring the functional form of frequency-dependent fitness by accounting for changes in abundance and relative fitness during a competition assay. Using two examples of ecological coexistence that arose in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli, we illustrate accurate quantification of the functional form of frequency-dependent relative fitness. Using a Monod-type model of growth dynamics, we show that two ecotypes in a typical cross-feeding interaction—such as when one bacterial population uses a byproduct generated by another—yields relative fitness that is linear with relative frequency.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolution/Evolution6.pdf,"[( 16 Dec 2014 , 2), ( 17 Dec 2014 , 13)]"

Heliconius butterflies collect pollen on their proboscis, moisten the pollen with saliva, and use a combination of mechanical disruption and chemical degradation to release free amino acids that are subsequently re-ingested in the saliva.  Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of this complex pollen feeding adaptation. Here we report an initial shotgun proteomic analysis of saliva from Heliconius melpomene. Results from liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry confidently identified 31 salivary proteins, most of which contained predicted signal peptides, consistent with extracellular secretion.  Further bioinformatic annotation of these salivary proteins indicated the presence of four distinct functional classes: proteolysis (10 proteins), carbohydrate hydrolysis (5), immunity (6), and ""housekeeping""(4).  Additionally, six proteins could not be functionally annotated beyond containing a predicted signal sequence.  The presence of several salivary proteases is consistent with previous demonstrations that Heliconius saliva has proteolytic capacity. It is likely these proteins play a key role in generating free amino acids during pollen digestion. The identification of proteins functioning in carbohydrate hydrolysis is consistent with Heliconius butterflies consuming nectar, like other lepidopterans, as well as pollen.  Immune-related proteins in saliva are also expected, given that ingestion of pathogens is a very likely route to infection.  The few ""housekeeping"" proteins are likely not true salivary proteins and reflect a modest level of contamination that occurred during saliva collection. Among the unannotated proteins were two sets of paralogs, each seemingly the result of a relatively recent tandem duplication.  These results offer a first glimpse into the molecular foundation of Heliconius pollen feeding and provide a substantial advance towards comprehensively understanding this striking evolutionary novelty.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology/Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology1.pdf,"[( 06 Dec 2016 , 1), ( 23 Dec 2014 , 5)]"

We reasoned that the differentiation of cortical responses underlying the subject's experiences, as measured by Lempel-Ziv complexity (incompressibility) of functional MRI images, should reflect the overall meaningfulness of a set of stimuli for the subject, rather than differences among the stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the differentiation of brain activity patterns in response to a movie sequence, to the same movie scrambled in time, and to 'TV noise', where the pixels from each movie frame were scrambled in space. While overall cortical activation was strong and widespread in all conditions, the differentiation (Lempel-Ziv complexity) of brain activation patterns was correlated with the meaningfulness of the stimulus set, being highest in the movie condition, intermediate in the scrambled movie condition, and minimal for 'TV noise'. Stimulus set meaningfulness was also associated with higher information integration among cortical regions.

In turn, pathogens deploy effector proteins that interfere with different steps in PTI signaling. However, our knowledge of PTI suppression by filamentous plant pathogens, i.e. fungi and oomycetes, remains fragmentary. Previous work revealed that BAK1/SERK3, a regulatory receptor of several PRRs, contributes to basal immunity against the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Moreover BAK1/SERK3 is required for the cell death induced by P. infestans elicitin INF1, a protein with characteristics of PAMPs. The P. infestans host-translocated RXLR-WY effector AVR3a is known to supress INF1-mediated defense by binding the E3 ligase CMPG1. In contrast, AVR3aKI-Y147del, a deletion mutant of the C-terminal tyrosine of AVR3a, fails to bind CMPG1 and suppress INF1 cell death. Here we studied the extent to which AVR3a and its variants perturb additional BAK1/SERK3 dependent PTI responses using the plant PRR FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2). We found that all tested variants of AVR3a, including AVR3aKI-Y147del, suppress early defense responses triggered by the bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg22 and reduce internalization of activated FLS2 from the plasma membrane without disturbing its nonactivated localization. Consistent with this effect of AVR3a on FLS2 endocytosis, we discovered that AVR3a associates with the Dynamin-Related Protein DRP2, a plant GTPase implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, DRP2 is required for ligand-induced FLS2 internalization but does not affect internalization of the growth receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Furthermore, overexpression of DRP2 suppressed accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggered by PAMP treatment. We conclude that AVR3a associates with a key cellular trafficking and membrane-remodeling complex involved in immune receptor-mediated endocytosis and signaling.

One of the major goals of combination therapy is to reduce the risk of drug resistance emerging during a patient's treatment. While this strategy generally has significant benefits over monotherapy, it may also select for multi-drug resistant strains, which present an important clinical and public health problem. For many antimicrobial treatment regimes, individual drugs have imperfect penetration throughout the body, so there may be regions where only one drug reaches an effective concentration. Here we propose that mismatched drug coverage can greatly speed up the evolution of multi-drug resistance by allowing mutations to accumulate in a stepwise fashion. We develop a mathematical model of within-host pathogen evolution under spatially heterogeneous drug coverage and demonstrate that even very small single-drug compartments lead to dramatically higher resistance risk. We find that it is often better to use drug combinations with matched penetration profiles, although there may be a trade-off between preventing eventual treatment failure due to resistance in this way, and temporarily reducing pathogen levels systemically. Our results show that drugs with the most extensive distribution are likely to be the most vulnerable to resistance.

Variation in GC content contributes to the positioning of these sequence-directed nucleosomes, and affects codon usage and amino acid composition in genes.

In most cases, change in transcript due to choosing alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites does not lead to change in protein sequence, while selection of alternative promoters and alternative splice sites would alter protein sequence. Nevertheless, all these alternations would give rise to different RNA isoforms. Selection of alternative RNA isoforms has been found to be associated with change in condition. For example, many studies have revealed that alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (poly(A)) are correlated to proliferation, differentiation, and cellular transformation. Thus, unlike gene expression in microarray, change in usage of splice sites or poly(A) sites associated with conditions does not involve differential expression and hence cannot be detected by differential analysis methods but can be done by association methods. Traditional association methods such as Pearson chi-square test and Fisher Exact test are single test methods and do not work on the RNA count data derived from replicate libraries. For this reason, we here developed a large-scale association method, called ranking analysis of chi-squares (RAX2). Simulations demonstrated that RAX2 worked well for finding association of changes in usage of poly(A) sites with condition change.

The theory is inspired by recent experimental results showing how information about changes to output synapses can travel backward along axons to affect a neuron's inputs. In neuronal development, competition for such ``retroaxonal'' signals determines which neurons live and which die. We suggest that in adults, an analogous form of competition occurs between neurons, to supply their targets with appropriate information in exchange for a ``payment'' returned to them backward along the axon. We review experimental evidence suggesting that neurotrophins may constitute such a signaling pathway in the adult brain.
	
We construct a mathematical model, in which a small number of ``consumer'' neurons receive explicit fast error signals while a larger number of ``producer'' neurons compete to supply them with information, guided by retroaxonal signals from the consumers and from each other. We define a loss function to measure network performance and define the ``worth'' of a producer to be the increase in loss that would result if that neuron were to fall silent. We show how slow retroaxonal signals can allow producers to estimate their worth, and how these estimates allow the network to perform a form of parallel search over multiple producer cells.

Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analises, it is important to assess the reliability of NGS data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the SNPs reported by 1000G (phase I) at five HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 ). We take advantage of the availability of HLA Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1,092 1000G samples, and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data.

We found a bias towards overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset.

The packing density measure that best correlates with rates is the weighted contact number (WCN), the sum of inverse square distances between the site’s Cα  and the other Cαs . According to a mechanistic stress model proposed recently, rates are determined by packing because mutating packed sites stresses and destabilizes the protein’s active conformation. While WCN is a measure of Cα packing, mutations replace side chains, which prompted us to consider whether a site’s evolutionary divergence is constrained by main-chain packing or side-chain packing. To address this issue, we extended the stress theory to model side chains explicitly. The theory predicts that rates should depend solely on side-chain packing. We tested these predictions on a data set of structurally and functionally diverse monomeric enzymes. We found that, on average, side-chain contact density (WCNρ ) explains 39.1% of among-sites rate variation, larger than main-chain contact density (WCNα ) which explains 32.1%.

Oogenesis is inherently susceptible to such conflicts because alleles compete for inclusion into the egg. Alleles that distort meiosis in their favor (i.e. meiotic drivers) often decrease organismal fitness, and therefore indirectly favor the evolution of mechanisms to suppress meiotic drive. In this light, many facets of oogenesis and gametogenesis have been interpreted as mechanisms of protection against genomic outlaws. That females of many animal species do not complete meiosis until after fertilization, appears to run counter to this interpretation, because this delay provides an opportunity for sperm-acting alleles to meddle with the outcome of female meiosis and help like alleles drive in heterozygous females. Contrary to this perceived danger, the population genetic theory presented herein suggests that, in fact, sperm nearly always evolve to increase the fairness of female meiosis in the face of genomic conflicts. These results are consistent with the apparent sperm dependence of the best characterized female meiotic drivers in animals. Rather than providing an opportunity for sperm collaboration in female meiotic drive, the 'fertilization requirement' indirectly protects females from meiotic drivers by providing sperm an opportunity to suppress drive.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolution/Evolution7.pdf,"[( 02 Aug 2014 , 1), ( 26 Dec 2014 , 4), ( 28 Jul 2014 , 2), ( 24 Dec 2014 , 5), ( 27 Dec 2014 , 12), ( 29 Jul 2014 , 1), ( 31 May 2014 , 2), ( 29 Dec 2014 , 1), ( 21 May 2014 , 5), ( 23 May 2014 , 3), ( 01 Aug 2014 , 4), ( 28 May 2014 , 1), ( 30 Jul 2014 , 4), ( 22 May 2014 , 1)]"

Earlier David Tilman drew attention to the fact that ecologists investigate interspecific competition phenomenologically, rather than mechanistically. To create a mechanistic model of a complex dynamic system we need to logically describe interactions of its subsystems which lead to emergence of new properties on the macro-level. There are black-box, grey-box and white-box models of complex systems. Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such non-transparent model. A white-box model of a complex system has ?transparent walls? and directly shows underlined mechanistic mechanisms ? all events at micro-, meso- and macro- levels of the modeled dynamic system are directly visible at all stages. Grey-box models are intermediate. Basic ecological models are of black-box type, e.g. Malthusian, Verhulst, Lotka-Volterra models. These models are not individual-based and cannot show features of local interactions of individuals of competing species. That is why they principally cannot provide a mechanistic insight into interspecific competition. To create a white-box model we need а physical theory of the object domain and its intrinsic axiomatic system. On the basis of axiomatic system there is a possibility to logically generate a new knowledge by logical deterministic cellular automata. Understanding of biodiversity mechanisms is the global research priority. Only knowledge of mechanisms of interspecific interactions can allow us to efficiently operate in the field of biodiversity conservation. Obviously that such knowledge must be based on mechanistic models of species coexistence. In order to create a serviceable theory of biodiversity it is necessary to renew attempts to create a basic mechanistic model of species coexistence. But the question arises: Why ecological modelers prefer to use the heaviest black-box mathematical methods which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems in principle, and why they do not use simple and long-known pure logical deterministic cellular automata, which easily can produce white-box models and directly generate clear mechanistic insights into dynamics of complex systems?",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print351.pdf,"[( 07 Jan 2015 , 2)]"

Three-quarters (74%) of lncRNAs are detected in the cytoplasm, the majority of which (62%) preferentially cofractionate with polyribosomes. Ribosomal lncRNA are highly expressed across tissues, under purifying evolutionary selection, and have cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios comparable to mRNAs and consistent across cell types. LncRNAs may be classified into three groups by their ribosomal interaction: non-ribosomal cytoplasmic lncRNAs, and those associated with either heavy or light polysomes. A number of mRNA-like features destin lncRNA for light polysomes, including capping and 5′UTR length, but not cryptic open reading frames or polyadenylation. Surprisingly, exonic retroviral sequences antagonise recruitment. In contrast, it appears that lncRNAs are recruited to heavy polysomes through basepairing to mRNAs. Finally, we show that the translation machinery actively degrades lncRNA. We propose that light polysomal lncRNAs are translationally engaged, while heavy polysomal lncRNAs are recruited indirectly.

trade off the acquisition of new genes which could improve their

Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V and J gene segments for both T cell receptor α (TRA) and β (TRB) loci were arranged in a self-similar manner when the spacing between the adjacent segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene segment, with an average fractal dimension of ~1.5.

To gain insight into potential PQS transcriptional function, we map and analyze PQS motifs in promoters of genes differentially-expressed in Bloom Syndrome (BS) and Werner Syndrome (WS), two human genetic disorders resulting in loss of PQS-interacting RecQ helicases.  Non-B-DNA structures at PQS might be stabilized in these syndromes. For BS and WS we demonstrate that PQS promoter abundance is generally higher in down-regulated genes and lower in up-regulated genes, and show that these effects are position-dependent.  To interpret these correlations we determined genome-wide PQS correlations with transcription using epigenetic information to predict gene expression.  We report that 33% and 35% of analyzed PQS positions in promoter antisense and sense strands, respectively, displayed statistically-significant correlation with gene expression.  Of these statistically-significant positions, 100% and 84% on antisense and sense strands, respectively, were correlated with reduced expression. This suggests that promoter PQS repress transcription.  Finally, we report neural network clustering analysis of PQS motifs to demonstrate that genes differentially-expressed in BS and WS are significantly biased in their PQS motifs, suggesting an unappreciated biological relationship between PQS, RecQ helicases, and transcription.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print357.pdf,"[( 11 Jan 2015 , 3)]"

However, the degree to which cell lines faithfully maintain differences in donor-specific phenotypes is still debated. We have previously reported that standard cell line maintenance practice results in a loss of donor-specific gene expression signatures in LCLs. An alternative to the LCL model is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system, which carries the potential to model tissue-specific physiology through the use of differentiation protocols. Still, existing LCL banks represent an important source of starting material for iPSC generation, and it is possible that the disruptions in gene regulation associated with long-term LCL maintenance could persist through the reprogramming process. To address this concern, we studied the effect of reprogramming mature LCLs to iPSCs on the ensuing gene expression patterns within and between six unrelated donor individuals. We show that the reprogramming process results in a recovery of donor-specific gene regulatory signatures. Since environmental contributions are unlikely to be a source of individual variation in our system of highly passaged cultured cell lines, our observations suggest that the effect of genotype on gene regulation is more pronounced in the iPSCs than in the LCL precursors. Our findings indicate that iPSCs can be a powerful model system for studies of phenotypic variation across individuals in general, and the genetic association with variation in gene regulation in particular.

The New World warblers (Parulidae) and Old World warblers (Phylloscopidae) are ecologically similar clades that differ strikingly in plumage coloration. We studied genetic and functional evolution of the short-wavelength sensitive visual pigments (SWS2 and SWS1) to ask if altered color perception could contribute to the plumage color differences between clades. We show SWS2 is short-wavelength shifted in birds that occupy open environments, such as finches, compared to those in closed environments, including warblers. Sequencing of opsin genes and phylogenetic reconstructions indicate New World warblers were derived from a finch-like form that colonized from the Old World 15-20Ma. During this process the SWS2 gene accumulated 6 substitutions in branches leading to New World warblers, inviting the hypothesis that passage through a finch-like ancestor resulted in SWS2 evolution. In fact, we show spectral tuning remained similar across warblers as well as the finch ancestor. Results reject the hypothesis of historical contingency based on opsin spectral tuning, but point to evolution of other aspects of visual pigment function.

Identifying genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds could enable breeding berry varieties with enhanced health benefits. Results: Toward this end, we annotated a draft blueberry genome assembly using RNA-Seq data from five stages of berry fruit development and ripening. Genome-guided assembly of RNA-Seq read alignments combined with output from ab initio gene finders produced around 60,000 gene models, of which more than half were similar to proteins from other species, typically the grape Vitis vinifera. Comparison of gene models to the PlantCyc database of metabolic pathway enzymes identified candidate genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, including bixin, an apocarotenoid with potential disease-fighting properties, and defense-related cyanogenic glycosides, which are toxic. Cyanogenic glycoside (CG) biosynthetic enzymes were highly expressed in green fruit, and a candidate CG detoxification enzyme was up regulated during fruit ripening. Candidate genes for ethylene, anthocyanin, and 400 other biosynthetic pathways were also identified. Homology-based annotation using Blast2GO and InterPro assigned Gene Ontology terms to around 15,000 genes. RNA-Seq expression profiling showed that blueberry growth, maturation, and ripening involve dynamic gene expression changes, including coordinated up and down regulation of metabolic pathway enzymes and transcriptional regulators. Analysis of RNA-seq alignments identified developmentally regulated alternative splicing, promoter use, and 3? end formation.

An important initial step in the systematic analysis and interpretation of genome-scale expression alteration involves identification of a set of perturbed transcriptional regulators whose differential activity can provide a proximate hypothesis to account for these transcriptomic changes. In the present work, we propose an unbiased and logically natural approach to transcription factor enrichment. It involves overlaying a list of experimentally determined differentially expressed genes on a background regulatory network coming from e.g. literature curation or computational motif scanning, and identifying that subset of regulators whose aggregated target set best discriminates between the altered and the unaffected genes. In other words, our methodology entails testing of all possible regulatory subnetworks, rather than just the target sets of individual regulators as is followed in most standard approaches. We have proposed an iterative search method to efficiently find such a combination, and benchmarked it on E. coli microarray and regulatory network data available in the public domain.

We demonstrate the validity of the generalized rule up to k=10 for all human chromosomes. Moreover, this Inversion Symmetry holds for many species, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, for ranges of k which may vary from 7 to 10 as chromosomal lengths vary from 2Mbp up to 200 Mbp. We demonstrate that the statistical distributions of inverted pairs of k-mers are very different from other natural pairings of k-mers, implying that inversion symmetry is a basic principle of chromosomal structure. We suggest that it came into being because genomic evolution employed many rearrangements which consisted of inversions of chromosomal sections; on length scales down to order 1-10Kbp. Model simulations substantiate this claim. Low-scale inversions during chromosomal evolution imply that IS may exist for short sections of human chromosomes. This is indeed the case: we find that chromosome sections of length 5Kbp satisfy IS for k=1 and k=2. The largest value of k for which IS holds, which we call the k-limit of IS, increases logarithmically as the section length increases.

Our results are contrary to previous research that PRDM9 is not associated with recombination in western chimpanzees (Auton et al. 2012). Additionally, we show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time-scale of complete hotspot turnover. We quantified the variation in the biased distribution of recombination rates towards recombination hotspots across great apes. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10‐15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected.

Furthermore, we could distinguish between genes that were selected for early during domestication (such as zagl1 involved in shattering) from genes that changed in the SW context (e.g. related to sugar content and adaptation to drought) likely as a response to the local arid environment and new cultural uses of maize.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print363.pdf,"[( 11 Jan 2015 , 9), ( 13 Jan 2015 , 3), ( 12 Jan 2015 , 5), ( 23 Jan 2015 , 1)]"

Despite sophisticated theory describing how populations spread, the prediction of spread rate remains a formidable challenge.  As well as the inherent stochasticity in the spread process, spreading populations are subject to strong evolutionary forces (operating on dispersal and reproductive rates) that can cause accelerating spread.  Despite these strong evolutionary forces, serial founder events and drift on the expanding range edge mean that evolutionary trajectories in the invasion vanguard may be highly stochastic.  Here I develop a model of spatial spread in continuous space that incorporates evolution of continuous traits under a quantitative genetic model of inheritance.  I use this model to investigate the potential role of evolution on the variation in spread rate between replicate model realisations.  Models incorporating evolution exhibited more than four times the variance in spread rate across replicate invasions compared with non-evolving scenarios.  Results suggest that the majority of this increase in variation is driven by evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front rather than initial founder events: in many cases evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front contributed more than 90% of the variance in spread rate over 30 generations.  Our uncertainty around predicted spread rates -- whether for invasive species or those shifting under climate change -- may be much larger than we expect when the spreading population contains heritable variation in rates of dispersal and reproduction.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biological Invasions/Biological Invasions1.pdf,"[( 11 Jan 2015 , 1), ( 13 Jan 2015 , 4), ( 12 Jan 2015 , 2), ( 03 Feb 2015 , 1)]"

The tetrapod limb is a highly diverse structure, and reduction of the limbs accounts for much of the phenotypes observed within species. Squamate reptiles represent one of the many lineages in which the limbs have been greatly modified from the pentadactyl generalized pattern; within the group, limb-reduced morphologies can vary from minor reductions in size of elements to complete limblessness, with several intermediate forms in between. Even though limb reduction is widespread, it is not clear what are the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms involved in the formation of reduced limb morphologies. 
Methods
In this study, we present an overview of limb morphology within the microteiid lizard group Gymnophthalmidae, focusing on digit number.
Results
We show that there are two major groups of limb-reduced gymnophthalmids. The first group is formed by lizard-like - and frequently pentadactyl - species, in which minor reductions (such as the loss of 1-2 phalanges mainly in digits I and V) are the rule; these morphologies generally correspond to those seen in other squamates. The second group is formed by species showing more drastic losses, which can include the absence of an externally distinct limb in adults. We also show the expression patterns of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the greatly reduced fore and hindlimb of a serpentiform gymnophthalmid.
Conclusions
Our discussion focus on identifying shared patterns of limb reduction among tetrapods, and explaining these patterns and the morphological variation within the gymnophthalmids based on the current knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways that coordinate limb development.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/The International Journal of Developmental Biology/The International Journal of Developmental Biology1.pdf,"[( 19 Jan 2015 , 9), ( 18 Jan 2015 , 2)]"

Currently, little is known about how RNA editing operates in cancer. Transcriptome analysis of 68 normal and cancerous breast tissues revealed that the editing enzyme ADAR acts uniformly, on the same loci, across tissues. Controlled ADAR expression experiments demonstrated that the editing frequency at all loci is proportional to both ADAR expression levels and the individual locus' editability?a propensity to be edited determined by the surrounding nucleotide sequence. Comparison of tumor transcriptomes to those of normal breast and breast organoids, i.e. pure normal breast epithelial cells, demonstrated that the editing frequency is increased in tumor cells. This was consistent with ADAR immunohistochemistry. We also demonstrated that type I interferon response and ADAR DNA copy number explain together 53% of ADAR expression in breast cancers, an observation also valid in nearly all of 20 other cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Interferon exposure increased ADAR mRNA, protein expression and editing in four breast cell lines. Finally, ADAR silencing using shRNA lentivirus transduction in breast cancer cell lines led to more cell proliferation and less apoptosis.

While there is much genetic support for tryptophan-dependent (Trp-D) IAA synthesis pathways, there is little genetic evidence for tryptophan-independent (Trp-I) IAA synthesis pathways. Using Arabidopsis, we identified two mutant alleles of ISS1 (Indole Severe Sensitive) that display indole-dependent IAA overproduction phenotypes including leaf epinasty and adventitious rooting. Stable isotope labeling showed that iss1, but not WT, uses primarily Trp-I IAA synthesis when grown on indole-supplemented medium. In contrast, both iss1 and WT use primarily Trp-D IAA synthesis when grown on unsupplemented medium. iss1 seedlings produce 8-fold higher levels of IAA when grown on indole and surprisingly have a 174-fold increase in Trp. These findings indicate that the iss1 mutant???s increase in Trp-I IAA synthesis is due to a loss of Trp catabolism. ISS1 was identified as At1g80360, a predicted aromatic aminotransferase, and in vitro and in vivo analysis confirmed this activity. At1g80360 was previously shown to primarily carry out the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid to Trp as an IAA homeostatic mechanism in young seedlings. Our results suggest that in addition to this activity, in more mature plants ISS1 has a role in Trp catabolism and possibly in the metabolism of other aromatic amino acids.

Metagenomic clone libraries in particular have aided in studies of microbial biodiversity and function, as well as allowed the mining of novel enzymes for specific functions of interest. These libraries are often constructed by cloning large-inserts (~30 kb) into a cosmid or fosmid vector. Recently, there have been reports of GC bias in fosmid metagenomic clone libraries, and it was speculated that the bias may be a result of fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences during the cloning process. However, evidence in the literature suggests that transcriptional activity or gene product toxicity may play a role in library bias. 

Results: To explore the possible mechanisms responsible for sequence bias in clone libraries, and in particular whether fragmentation is involved, we constructed a cosmid clone library from a human microbiome sample, and sequenced DNA from three different steps of the library construction process: crude extract DNA, size-selected DNA, and cosmid library DNA. We confirmed a GC bias in the final constructed cosmid library, and we provide strong evidence that the sequence bias is not due to fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences but is likely occurring after the DNA is introduced into E. coli. To investigate the influence of strong constitutive transcription, we searched the sequence data for consensus promoters and found that rpoD/sigma-70 promoter sequences were underrepresented in the cosmid library. Furthermore, when we examined the reference genomes of taxa that were differentially abundant in the cosmid library relative to the original sample, we found that the bias appears to be more closely correlated with the number of rpoD/sigma-70 consensus sequences in the genome than with simple GC content.

Conclusions: The GC bias of metagenomic clone libraries does not appear to be due to DNA fragmentation. Rather, analysis of promoter consensus sequences provides support for the hypothesis that strong constitutive transcription from sequences recognized as rpoD/sigma-70 consensus-like in E. coli may lead to plasmid instability or loss of insert DNA. Our results suggest that despite widespread use of E. coli to propagate foreign DNA, the effects of in vivo transcriptional activity may be under-appreciated.

We identified adaptive mutations in laboratory evolved populations, derived mutational signatures in a variety of conditions and ploidy states, and determined that half of the mutations accumulated positively affect cellular fitness.

The PCP4 mutations had a very low frequency (.12 and .07) so making hazardous to hypothesize their direct effect on immune response. On the contrary, the mutation detected in the CD109 gene showed a strong linkage disequilibrium with the anonymous marker. Direct sequencing of the DNA of sheep of different populations showed that disequilibrium was maintained. Allele frequency at the hypothesized marker associated to immune response, calculated  for other breeds of sheep, showed that the marker allele potentially associated to disease resistance is more frequent in the local breeds and in breeds that have not been submitted to selection programs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print367.pdf,"[( 20 Jan 2015 , 4), ( 21 Jan 2015 , 1)]"

The branching order near the base of the tree is one such outstanding issue. To address this question we assemble a novel data set comprised of 1,080 orthologous loci derived from 36 publicly available genomes and dissect the phylogenetic signal present in each individual partition. The size of this data set allows for a closer look at the potential biases and sources of non-phylogenetic signal. We assessed a range of measures for each data partition including information content, saturation, rate of evolution, long-branch score, and taxon occupancy and explored how each of these characteristics impacts phylogeny estimation. We then used these data to prepare a reduced set of partitions that fit an optimal set of criteria and are amenable to the most appropriate and computationally intensive analyses using site-heterogeneous models of sequence evolution. We also employed several strategies to examine the potential for long-branch attraction to bias our inferences. All of our analyses support Ctenophora as the sister lineage to other Metazoa, although support for this relationship varies among analyses. We find no support for the traditional view uniting the ctenophores and Cnidaria (jellies, anemones, corals, and kin).

The small-effect loci that we identify overlap with regions that were identified in selection experiments with D. simulans on octanoic acid and in QTL analyses of adult resistance to octanoic acid. Our high-resolution analysis sheds new light upon the complexity of M. citrifolia resistance, and suggests that partial resistance to lower levels of M. citrifolia toxin could be passed through introgression from D. sechellia to D. simulans in nature.

We used cytological descriptions of karyotype to identify large pericentric inversions between species of Estrildid finches (family Estrildidae) and a time-dated phylogeny to assess the genomic, geographic, and phylogenetic context of karyotype evolution in this group. Inversions between finch species fixed at an average rate of one every 2.26 My. Inversions were twice as likely to fix on the sex chromosomes compared to the autosomes, possibly a result of their repeat density, and inversion fixation rate for all chromosomes scales with range size. Alternative mutagenic input explanations are not supported, as the number of inversions on a chromosome does not correlate with its length or map size. Inversions have fixed 3.3× faster in three continental clades than in two island chain clades, and fixation rate correlates with both range size and the number of sympatric species pairs. These results point to adaptation as the dominant mechanism driving fixation and suggest a role for gene flow in karyotype divergence.

age equilibrium and increased genetic drift over many generations. However, many
such populations, like the Greenlandic Inuit population, have recently experienced
substantial admixture with other populations, which can complicate the association
studies. One important complication is that most current methods for performing
association testing are based on the assumption that the effect of the tested ge-
netic marker is the same regardless of ancestry. This is a reasonable assumption
for a causal variant, but may not hold for the genetic markers that are tested in
association studies, which are usually not causal. The effects of non-causal genetic
markers depend on how strongly their presence correlate with the presence of the
causal marker, and this may vary between ancestral populations because of different
linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies.
Motivated by this, we here introduce a new statistical method for association
testing in recently admixed populations, where the effect sizes are allowed to depend
on the ancestry of the allele.Our method does not rely on accurate inference of local
ancestry, yet using simulations we show that in some scenarios it gives a dramatic
increase in statistical power to detect associations. In addition, the method allows
for testing for difference in effect size between ancestral populations, which can be

Our data reveal a dynamic genome that continues to mutate and decay, but also to amplify and acquire genes despite the organism having lost its natural competence and become host-restricted.

The lifestyle of S. equi within the horse is defined by short-term acute disease, strangles, followed by long-term carriage. Population analysis reveals evidence of convergent evolution in isolates from post-acute disease samples, as a result of niche adaptation to persistent carriage within a host. Mutations that lead to metabolic streamlining and the loss of virulence determinants are more frequently found in carriage isolates, suggesting that the pathogenic potential of S. equi reduces as a consequence of long term residency within the horse post acute disease. An example of this is the deletion of the equibactin siderophore locus that is associated with iron acquisition, which occurs exclusively in carrier isolates, and renders S. equi significantly less able to cause acute disease in the natural host.

Another model species that is widely used in electrophysiological or developmental studies is the ferret; however, no systematic compilation of brain connectivity is currently available for this species. Thus, we have started developing a database of anatomical connections and architectonic features of the ferret brain (the Ferretome, www.ferretome.org). The main goals of this database project are: (1) to assemble structural information on the ferret brain that is currently widely distributed in the literature or in different in-house laboratory databases into a single resource which is open to the scientific community; (2) to try and build an extendable community resource that is beneficial to researchers in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, as well as to neuroanatomists, by adding value to their data through algorithms for efficient data representation, analysis and visualization; (3) to create techniques for the representation of quantitative and raw data; and (4) to expand existing database ontologies in order to accommodate further neuroarchitectural information for identifying essential relations between brain structure and connections.
The Ferretome database has adapted essential features of the CoCoMac methodology and legacy. In particular, its data model is derived from CoCoMac. It also uses a semantic parcellation of ferret brain regions as well as a logical brain maps transformation algorithm (objective relational transformation, ORT). The database is being developed in MySQL and has been populated with literature reports on tract tracing observations in the ferret brain using a custom-designed web interface that allows efficient and validated simultaneous input and proofreading by multiple curators. The database is also equipped with a web interface for generating output data that was designed with non-computer science specialist users in mind. This interface can be extended to produce connectivity matrices in several formats including a graphical representation superimposed on established ferret brain maps. An important feature of the Ferretome database is the possibility to trace back entries in connectivity matrices to the original studies archived in the system.
Currently, the Ferretome contains 50 reports on connections comprising 20 injection reports with more than 150 labeled source and target areas, the majority reflecting connectivity of subcortical nuclei. We hope that the Ferretome database will become a useful resource for neuroinformatics and neural modeling, and will support studies of the ferret brain as well as facilitate advances in comparative studies of mesoscopic brain connectivity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Neuroinformatics/Frontiers in Neuroinformatics2.pdf,"[( 23 Jan 2015 , 3)]"

We use the Hilbert transform to estimate moment-to-moment fluctuations of the phase difference between signals. After confirming the presence of scale-invariance we estimate the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).  An exponent of >0.5 is indicative of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the signal. We find that LRTCs are present in the α/μ and β frequency bands of resting state MEG data.  We demonstrate that finger movement disrupts LRTCs correlations, producing a phase relationship with a structure similar to that of Gaussian white noise. The results are validated by applying the same analysis to data with Gaussian white noise phase difference, recordings from an empty scanner and phase-shuffled time series.  
We interpret the findings through comparison of the results with those we obtained from an earlier study during which we adopted this method to characterise phase relationships within a Kuramoto model of oscillators in its sub-critical, critical and super-critical synchronisation states.  We find that the resting state MEG from left and right motor cortices shows moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase difference with a similar temporal structure to that of a system of Kuramoto oscillators just prior to its critical level of coupling, and that finger tapping moves the system away from this pre-critical state towards a more random state.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print371.pdf,"[( 23 Jan 2015 , 4)]"

To assess the performance of Altrans we compared it to Cufflinks, a well-established transcript quantification method.

We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (94% and 98% replication in Altrans and Cufflinks, respectively). We find that method specific asQTLs are largely due to different types of alternative splicing events detected by each method.

This Caucasian family was recruited from Utah, USA. Illumina-based WGS was performed on 10 members of this family, with additional Complete Genomics-based WGS performed on the nuclear portion of the family (mother, father and the two affected males). Using WGS datasets from 10 members of this family, we can increase the reliability of the biological inferences with an integrative bioinformatic pipeline. In combination with insights from clinical evaluations and medical diagnostic analyses, these DNA sequencing data were used in the study of three plausible genetic disease models that might uncover genetic contribution to the syndrome. We found a 2 to 5-fold difference in the number of variants detected as being relevant for various disease models when using different sets of sequencing data and analysis pipelines. We derived greater accuracy when more pipelines were used in conjunction with data encompassing a larger portion of the family, with the number of putative de-novo mutations being reduced by 80%, due to false negative calls in the parents. The boys carry a maternally inherited missense variant in a X-chromosomal gene TAF1, which we consider as disease relevant.

Available calibration software provides many options for the shape of the prior probability distribution of ages at a node to be calibrated, but the question of how to assign a Bayesian prior from limited fossil data remains open.  

Results: We introduce two new methods for generating priors based upon (1) the interval between the two oldest fossils in a clade, i.e., the penultimate gap (PenG), and (2) the ghost lineage length (GLin), defined as the difference between the oldest fossils for each of two sister lineages. We show that PenG and GLin/2 are point estimates of the interval between the oldest fossil and the true age for the node. Furthermore, given either of these quantities, we derive a principled prior distribution for the true age.  This prior is log-logistic, and can be implemented approximately in existing software.  Using simulated data, we test these new methods against some other approaches.  

Conclusions: When implemented as approaches for assigning Bayesian priors, the PenG and GLin methods increase the accuracy of inferred divergence times, showing considerably more precision than the other methods tested, without significantly greater bias.  When implemented as approaches to post-hoc scaling of a tree by linear regression, the PenG and GLin methods exhibit less bias than other methods tested.

Recent advances in molecular-data based computational methods have considerably improved our ability to identify and test species limits. Here, we use an integrative approach to delineate species in a complex of sea cucumbers. We used a three-step approach to show that Holothuria impatiens, a common, shallow-water species, occurring across the Indo-Pacific, the Western Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, targeted locally by fisheries, is a complex of at least 13 species. (1) We used the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model to identify putative species a priori hypotheses.

(2) We assessed based on coloration patterns and distributional information, the most relevant hypothesis. This approach allowed us to identify unambiguously 9 species. However, some of the lineages consistently assigned to belong to different species using GMYC, are occurring in sympatry and are not  differentiated morphologically. (3) We used Bayes factors to compare competing models of species assignment using the multispecies coalescent as implemented in *BEAST. This approach allowed us to validate that the species identified using GMYC were likely reproductively isolated.

Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure is common in mathematical models. 

Methods: We view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game. 

Results: We show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary -- such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane -- we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow. 

Interpretation: Pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells.

Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction methods are routinely used to reduce the computational burden of analyses.

(1990), we do not assume that Ca domain formation and collapse are fast compared to channel gating.  We demonstrate the population density and moment-based modeling approaches using a 12-state Markov chain model of an L-type Ca channel introduced by Greenstein and Winslow (2002).   Simulated whole cell voltage clamp responses yield an inactivation function for the whole cell Ca current that agrees with the traditional approach when domain dynamics are fast. We analyze the voltage-dependence of Ca inactivation that may occur via slow heterogeneous domains. Next, we find that when channel permeability is held constant, Ca-mediated inactivation of L-type channel increases as the domain time constant increases, because a slow domain collapse rate leads to increased mean domain [Ca] near open channels; conversely, when the maximum domain [Ca] is held constant, inactivation decreases as the domain time constant increases.  Comparison of simulation results using population densities and moment equations confirms the computational efficiency of the moment-based approach, and enables the validation of two distinct methods of truncating and closing the open system of moment equations.

We used a series of backcross hybrid populations between D. americana and D. virilis to map the genomic interval responsible for the difference between this species pair. First, we show that the pupal case color difference is caused by a single Mendelizing factor, which we ultimately map to an ~11kb region on chromosome 5. The mapped interval includes only the first exon and regulatory region(s) of the dopamine N-acetyltransferase gene (Dat). This gene encodes an enzyme that is known to play a part in the insect pigmentation pathway.

In the absence of direct group-level interactions, groups with the most cooperative members will outcompete less cooperative groups, while within any group the least cooperative members will be the most successful. Introducing group-level interactions, however, such as raiding or warfare, changes the selective landscape for groups. Our model suggests that as the global population becomes more integrated and the rate of intergroup conflict increases, selection increasingly favors unequally distributed power structures, where individual influence is weighted by acquired resources. The advantage to less democratic groups rests in their ability to facilitate selection for cooperative strategies – involving cooperation both among themselves and with outsiders – in order to produce the resources necessary to fuel their success in inter-group conflicts, while simultaneously selecting for leaders (and corresponding collective behavior) who are unburdened with those same prosocial norms. The coevolution of cooperative social norms and institutions of power facilitates the emergence of a leadership class of the selfish and has implications for theories of inequality, structures of governance, non-cooperative personality traits, and hierarchy.

Three main findings emerged from our meta-analysis:
1)	The three psychiatric spectra do not appear to have their own specific damage. 
2)	It is possible to define two new damage clusters. The first includes substantial parts of the salience network, and the second is more closely linked to the auditory-visual, auditory and visual somatic areas.

Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms lying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses—neural plasticity and neural activity—are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory.

By collecting and analysing data obtained on multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that commonly used models of motility within crowded environments can be used to reliably predict our random walk data.

Despite controversy surrounding success of the attempts to accomplish this goal, a full understanding of adaptive genetic variation necessitates knowledge about the genomic location and patterns of dispersion for the genetic components affecting fitness-related phenotypic traits. Even with advances in next generation sequencing technologies, the production of full genome sequences for non-model species is often cost prohibitive, especially for tree species such as pines where genome size often exceeds 20 to 30 Gbp. We address this need by constructing a dense linkage map for fox- tail pine (Pinus balfouriana Grev. & Balf.), with the ultimate goal of uncovering and explaining the origin and evolutionary dynamics of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations of this forest tree species. We utilized megagametophyte arrays (n = 76?95 megagametophytes/tree) from four maternal trees in combination with double-digestion restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to produce a consensus linkage map covering 98.58% of the foxtail pine genome, which was estimated to be 1276 cM in length (95% CI: 1174cM to 1378cM). A novel bioinformatic approach using iterative rounds of marker ordering and imputation was employed to produce single-tree linkage maps (507?17066 contigs/map; lengths: 1037.40?1572.80 cM). These linkage maps were collinear across maternal trees, with highly correlated marker orderings (Spearman's ρ > 0.95). A consensus linkage map derived from these single-tree linkage maps contained 12 linkage groups along which 20 655 contigs were non-randomly distributed across 901 unique positions (n = 23 contigs/position), with an average spacing of 1.34 cM between adjacent positions. Of the 20 655 contigs positioned on the consensus linkage map, 5627 had enough sequence similarity to contigs contained within the most recent build of the loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) genome to identify them as putative homologs containing both genic and non-genic loci. Importantly, all 901 unique positions on the consensus linkage map had at least one contig with putative homology to loblolly pine. When combined with the other biological signals that predominate in our data (e.g., correlations of recombination fractions across single trees), we show that dense linkage maps for non-model forest tree species can be efficiently constructed using next generation sequencing technologies.

Age- and neurodegeneration related deterioration in sleep/wake timing was first described in humans decades ago, but has only recently been recapitulated in model organisms. In order to delineate the causal relationships between aging, sleep, neuronal function and the molecular clockwork, we have developed FLYGLOW, a broadly applicable bioluminescence-based system which allows rest/activity cycles, sleep consolidation and molecular clock gene expression to be quantified simultaneously in dozens of individual flies over many days/weeks.

Two candidate frameworks for meeting this challenge currently exist in forest ecology. Niche-based approaches succeed in describing successional dynamics in response to recurrent disturbances. Approaches based on Hubbell's neutral theory describe abundance patterns in highly diverse communities. Yet both theories are unsuccessful where their competitor is strong, highlighting an enduring need for reconciliation. In fact, the perception that niche and neutral processes are incompatible may have arisen because both types of models have lacked some critical features of real forests. Here we report a productive reconciliation that arises from extending niche models to include three ubiquitous features of vegetation: (1) plant growth under light competition, (2) multiple trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function, and (3) evolutionary community assembly. We show that fitness equivalence – which neutral theory controversially takes as an assumption – naturally arises as a mechanistic outcome of niche differentiation, but only within a specific region of trait space, corresponding to shade-tolerant later-successional strategies. In this way, niche diversification can lead, via evolved neutrality, to a proliferation of shade-tolerant strategies, one of the phenomena that motivated the development of neutral theory. Earlier niche models focussed on a single growth-mortality trait and found no evolved neutrality. In contrast, the model introduced here includes a second trait, height at maturation, in addition to a growth-mortality trait in the form of leaf-construction cost. We show that fitness equivalence only emerges when diversifications include this second trait. We also demonstrate that our extended niche model generates markedly different forest types under different environmental conditions, recovering known biogeographic patterns. By evolving forests from first principles, our study constructively resolves the protracted debate about niche versus neutral dynamics for forest communities, and provides a platform for a synthetic theory of forest structure and diversity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PNAS/PNAS13.pdf,"[( 15 Jun 2015 , 4), ( 31 Jan 2015 , 4), ( 30 Jan 2015 , 1), ( 02 Dec 2016 , 3), ( 01 Feb 2015 , 1), ( 02 Feb 2015 , 1), ( 03 Feb 2015 , 6)]"

We are able to demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation at different timescales that portrays the branching canals in Waddington?s illustration. We also present a repressilator-type system that activates suppressed genes via sustained oscillations in a flattened landscape, hence providing an alternative scheme for cellular reprogramming. The time-dependent parameters governed by gradient-based dynamics regulate cell differentiation, dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. Our prediction integrates the theories of branching and structural oscillations in cell-fate determination, which reveals key temporal patterns of cell differentiation and associated diseases, such as cancer.

 This is the pre-print version of a paper submitted to Technische Mechanik (ISSN 0232-3869)
Hydrodynamic analysis suggests that the injection of drag-reducing agents (DRA) in nanomolar concentrations may hinder metastasizing of circulating tumor cells and serve this way as a complementary post-operative treatment for cancer patients. Our conclusion is based on the following considerations:
- Tumor cells need an extra nutrient supply in order to survive and grow.
- The attachment of circulating tumor cells therefore tends to occur at sites in the human circulatory system characterized by localized turbulence, which enhances the mass transfer of nutrients, e.g., at sites of vessel branching and bending with plasma skimming. 
- Also obstacles to blood flow, such as plaques (atherosclerosis), tumors, and red blood cell (RBC) rouleaux, produce local vortices that increase mass transfer, i.e., food supply. 
- DRA have the ability to smooth (laminarise) localized turbulence in the circulatory system and to reduce mass transfer.
- Depriving tumor cells of their required nutrient levels will reduce the probability of creating metastatic tumors, and may lead to their starvation-induced death.
In the first part of our essay we demonstrate how flow constrictions decrease mean blood flow velocity, wall shear rates, and Reynolds numbers respectively, and increase the friction factor. 
Experimentally derived apparent viscosity data from literature will be used to determine the probability of RBC rouleaux formation. This is of importance since RBC rouleaux are typically associated with turbulent blood flow patterns. An increase in apparent viscosity at low flow rates will be attributed to the formation of RBC rouleaux.
In part two we discuss the application of the Lockhart/Martinelli method to determine the pressure drop in blood vessels. The objective is to determine a mass transfer coefficient characterizing the mass transfer between the center and the wall of both healthy and cancerous blood vessels. This coefficient indicates the nutrient supply available to tumor cells under different flow conditions and shows the effect of DRA.
Our hydrodynamic approach contrasts with previous studies of the possible benefits of DRA injection, which were focused on improving blood supply. We emphasize the reduction of the mass transfer rate as a tool to withhold turbulence induced supplementary food supply to tumor cells.
Due to the possibility of unexpected side effects when using DRA (including their mechanical degradation products) animal models are indispensable before clinical trials.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print395.pdf,"[( 04 Feb 2015 , 2), ( 06 Nov 2016 , 3)]"

This allowed us to directly test the assumption that island species have small values of Ne. We found that island species had significantly less genetic diversity than mainland species; however, this pattern could be attributed to a subset of island species that had undergone a recent population bottleneck.

In this paper, we investigated the independent impact of dinotefuran through each of the two vehicles. We confirmed that dinotefuran intake per bee until colony extinction due to administration through pollen paste (DF-TIPP) was roughly one-fifth as much as that through sugar syrup (DF-TISS). The intake was largely independent of dinotefuran concentration. We considered the possibility of DF-TIPP per bee as an indicator to assess the impact of persistent pesticide on a honeybee colony in a practical apiary.
This work has replicated the finding that a honeybee colony has dwindled away to nothing after assuming an aspect of a colony collapse disorder (CCD) by administration of the neonicotinoids dinotefuran and clothianidin in our previous work, regardless of the vehicles. In addition, a failure in wintering was observed in case of administration of dinotefuran with the lowest concentration in this work even if the colony appeared vigorous before winter.

Furthermore, the fenitrothion colony succeeded to be alive for more than 293 days after administration, and also succeeded an overwintering, which indicates that colonies exposed to fenitrothion can recover after the exposure.
Meanwhile, the dinotefuran colony became extinct even though the intake of dinotefuran was estimated to be comparable with that of fenitrothion in terms of the LD50 of a honeybee. Moreover, the colonies in our previous long-term experiments where dinotefuran with higher concentration were administered only for first few days (Yamada et al., 2012) became extinct in 104 days and 162 days, respectively. From these results, we speculate that colonies exposed to dinotefuran hardly recover from the damage because dinotefuran is much more persistent than fenitrothion and toxic foods stored in cells can affect a colony in a long period.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print398.pdf,"[( 04 Feb 2015 , 3)]"

Here, we present EMRinger, which tests model-to-map agreement using side-chain dihedral-directed map density measurements. These measurements reveal local map density peaks and show that peaks located at rotameric angles are a sensitive marker of whether the backbone is correctly positioned. The EMRinger Score can be improved by model refinement, suggesting its utility as an effective model-to-map validation metric. Additionally, EMRinger sampling identifies how radiation damage alters scattering from negatively charged amino acids during data collection.

A number of computational tools have been developed to identify driver genes for a specific cancer from a group of cancer samples. However, it remains a challenge to identify driver mutations/genes for an individual patient and design drug therapies. We developed iCAGES, a novel statistical framework to rapidly analyze patient-specific cancer genomic data, prioritize personalized cancer driver events and predict personalized therapies. iCAGES includes three consecutive layers: the first layer integrates contributions from coding, non-coding and structural variations to infer driver variants. For coding mutations, we developed a radial support vector machine using manually curated mutations to predict their driver potential. The second layer identifies driver genes, by using information from the first layer and integrating prior biological knowledge on gene-gene and gene-phenotype networks. The third layer prioritizes personalized drug treatment, by classifying potential driver genes into different categories and querying drug-gene databases. Compared to currently available tools, iCAGES achieves better performance by correctly classifying point coding driver mutations (AUC=0.97, 95% CI: 0.97-0.97, significantly better than the second best tool with P=0.01) and genes (AUC=0.93, 95% CI: 0.93-0.94, significantly better than MutSigCV with P<1X10-15). We also illustrated two examples where iCAGES correctly nominated two targeted drugs for two advanced cancer patients with exceptional response, based on their somatic mutation profiles. iCAGES leverages personal genomic information and prior biological knowledge, effectively identifies cancer driver genes and predicts treatment strategies. iCAGES is available at http://icages.usc.edu.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Medicine/Genome Medicine7.pdf,"[( 07 Feb 2015 , 1), ( 09 Feb 2015 , 1)]"

With longer pre-digestion times, the increase is asymptotic while molecular complexity decreases. We repeated the experiment with n=21 and t=15-30', and document a significant increase in endogenous DNA content (one-sided paired t-test: p=0.009). We advocate the implementation of a short pre-digestion step as a standard procedure in ancient DNA extractions from bone material.

SPS is unique among proteins of the selenoprotein biosynthesis machinery in that it is, in many species, a selenoprotein itself, although, as in all selenoproteins, Sec is often replaced by cysteine (Cys). In metazoan genomes we found, however, SPS genes with lineage specific substitutions other than Sec or Cys. Our results show that these non-Sec, non-Cys SPS genes originated through a number of independent gene duplications of diverse molecular origin from an ancestral selenoprotein SPS gene. Although of independent origin, complementation assays in fly mutants show that these genes share a common function, which most likely emerged in the ancestral metazoan gene. This function appears to be unrelated to selenophosphate synthesis, since all genomes encoding selenoproteins contain Sec or Cys SPS genes (SPS2), but those containing only non-Sec, non-Cys SPS genes (SPS1) do not encode selenoproteins. Thus, in SPS genes, through parallel duplications and subsequent convergent subfunctionalization, two functions initially carried by a single gene are recurrently segregated at two different loci. RNA structures enhancing the readthrough of the Sec-UGA codon in SPS genes, which may be traced back to prokaryotes, played a key role in this process. The SPS evolutionary history in metazoans constitute a remarkable example of the emergence and evolution of gene function.  We have been able to trace this history with unusual detail thanks to the singular feature of SPS genes, wherein the amino acid at a single site determines protein function, and, ultimately, the evolutionary fate of an entire class of genes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research14.pdf,"[( 06 Feb 2015 , 6)]"

Although the major transitions in cancer development are increasingly well understood, we lack quantitative theory for how preventive measures and post-excision ('reactive') treatments are predicted to affect risks of obtaining a life threatening cancer or relapse, respectively. We employ analytical and numerical models to evaluate how continuous measures such as life style changes, and certain non-targeted and targeted treatments affect both neoplastic growth and the frequency of resistant clones. We find that preventive measures can have a negligible impact on pre-cancerous lesions and yet achieve considerable reductions in risk of invasive cancer. Importantly, our model, based on realistic parameter estimates, predicts that daily cancer cell arrest levels of 0.2-0.3% produce optimal outcomes for prevention, whereas for reaction the level is 0.3-0.4%. For similar cancer cell populations, prevention outcomes are, on average, always better than reactive ones. This is because reactive measures are more likely to select for faster growing subclones with higher probabilities of resistance, highlighting the difficulty in countering relapse regardless of therapeutic impact on cancer cell populations.

However, at existing sample sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated heritability. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes may improve detection without the need for larger datasets.

The Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds. Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and has several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis. However, existing methods require distinct control samples between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability. Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs.

We apply our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls, enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease associations across five diseases not previously declared.

Our technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and establishes robust limits on the expected FDR.

Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome.  Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20% for the DGRP and 9% for the reference genome.  Based on the size of admixture tracts and the approximate timing of admixture, I estimate that the DGRP population underwent roughly 13.9 generations per year.  Notably, ancestry levels varied strikingly among genomic regions, with significantly less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes such as circadian rhythm.  An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by a genome-wide signal of ancestry disequilibrium, in that many between-chromosome pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa-Europe allele combinations.  These results support the hypothesis that admixture between partially genetically isolated Drosophila populations led to natural selection against incompatible genetic variants, and that this process is ongoing.

Palindromic sequences are important DNA motifs involved in the regulation of different cellular processes and are a potential source of genetic instability. In order to search and study the long palindromic regions in the rice genome ???R??? statistical programming language was used. All palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats with spacer DNA, could be analyzed and sorted according to their frequency, size, GC content, compact index etc. The results showed that the overall palindrome frequency was high in rice genome (nearly 51000 palindromes), with highest and lowest number of palindromes, respectively belongs to chromosome 1 and 12. Palindrome numbers could well explain the rice chromosome expansion (R2>92%). Average GC content of the palindromic sequences is 42.1%, indicating AT-richness and hence, the low-complexity of palindromic sequences. The results also showed different compact indices of palindromes in different chromosomes (43.2 per cM in chromosome 8 and 34.5 per cM in chromosome 3, as highest and lowest, respectively). The possible application of palindrome identification can be the use in the development of a molecular marker system facilitating some genetic studies such as evaluation of genetic variation and gene mapping and also serving as a useful tool in population structure analysis and genome evolution studies.

However, to date it has not been systematically assessed how coordination in the hand's joints affects every day actions. This is important for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, to understand the representations and computations underlying motor control ""in-the-wild"" situations, and secondly to develop smarter controllers for prosthetic hands that have the same functionality as natural limbs. In this work we exploit the correlation structure of our hand and finger movements in daily-life. The novelty of our idea is that instead of averaging variability out, we take the view that the structure of variability may contain valuable information about the task being performed. We asked seven subjects to interact in 17 daily-life situations, and quantified behaviour in a principled manner using CyberGlove body sensor networks that, after accurate calibration, track all major joints of the hand. Our key findings are: 1. We confirmed that hand control in daily-life tasks is very low-dimensional, with four to five dimensions being sufficient to explain 80-90% of the variability in the natural movement data. 2. We established a universally applicable measure of manipulative complexity that allowed us to measure and compare limb movements across tasks. We used Bayesian latent variable models to model the low-dimensional structure of finger joint angles in natural actions. 3. This allowed us to build a naïve classifier that within the first 1000ms of action initiation (from a flat hand start configuration) predicted which of the 17 actions was going to be executed - enabling us to reliably predict the action intention from very short-time-scale initial data, further revealing the foreseeable nature of hand movements for control of neuroprosthetics and tele operation purposes. 4. Using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on our latent variable model permitted us to reconstruct with high accuracy (<5°-6° MAE) the movement trajectory of missing fingers by simply tracking the remaining fingers. Overall, our results suggest the hypothesis that specific hand actions are orchestrated by the brain in such a way that in the natural tasks of daily-life there is sufficient redundancy and predictability to be directly exploitable for neuroprosthetics.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience/Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience3.pdf,"[( 14 Feb 2015 , 1), ( 18 Mar 2015 , 1), ( 16 Feb 2015 , 2), ( 09 Feb 2015 , 3)]"

We show that ARC is able to assemble high quality, unbiased mitochondrial genomes seeded from 11 progressively divergent references, and is able to assemble full mitochondrial genomes starting from short, poor quality ancient DNA reads.

Calculating exact p-values for genome-wide association studies in inbred populations,Pre print,"[(Shen, Xia,  Karolinska Institutet)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/015339 ,"Motivation: Genome-wide association studies have been conducted in inbred populations where the sample size is small. The ordinary association p-values and multiple testing correction therefore become questionable, as the detected genetic effect may or may not be due to chance, depending on the minor allele frequency distribution across the genome. Instead of permutation testing, marker-specific false positive rate can be analytically calculated in inbred populations without heterozygotes. 

Results: Solutions of exact p-values for genome-wide association studies in inbred populations were derived and implemented. An example is presented to illustrate that the marker-specific experiment-wise p-value varies as the genome-wide minor allele frequency distribution changes. A simulation using real Arabidopsis thaliana genome indicates that the use of exact p-values improves detection power and reduces inflation due to population structure. An analysis of a defense-related case-control phenotype using the exact p-values revealed the causal locus, where markers with higher MAFs had smaller p-values than the top variants with lower MAFs in ordinary genome-wide association analysis.

Using recently refined biostratigraphic data that suggest two pulses of extinction leading up to the Permian-Triassic boundary, we show that during times of low extinction, paleocommunities were no more stable than randomly assembled communities, but they became stable during the mass extinction. Modelled food webs before and after the mass extinction have lower resilience and less stable transient dynamics compared to random food webs lacking in functional structure but of equal species richness. They are, however, more stable than random food webs of equal richness but with randomized functional structure. In contrast, models become increasingly more resilient and have more stable transient dynamics, relative to the random models, as the mass extinction progressed. The increased stability of the community that resulted from the first pulse of extinction was driven by significant selective extinction against small-bodied amniotes, and significantly greater probabilities of survival of large-bodied amniotes.

Such constraints should be evident in traits that, across many species, cluster around particular modal values, with few intermediates between modes. Here, I compile a new global database of 599 species from 94 plant families showing that stomatal ratio, an important functional trait affecting photosynthesis, is multimodal, hinting at distinct peaks in the adaptive landscape. The dataset confirms that most plants have all their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but shows for the first time that species with roughly half their stomata on each leaf surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. Based on a new evolutionary process model, this multimodal pattern is unlikely without constraint. Further, multimodality has evolved repeatedly across disparate families, evincing long-term constraint on the adaptive landscape. A simple cost-benefit model of stomatal ratio demonstrates that selection alone is sufficient to generate an adaptive landscape with multiple peaks. Finally, phylogenetic comparative methods indicate that life history evolution drives shifts between peaks. This implies that the adaptive benefit conferred by amphistomy -- increased photosynthesis -- is most important in plants with fast life histories, challenging existing ideas that amphistomy is an adaptation to thick leaves and open habitats. I conclude that peaks in the adaptive landscape have been constrained by selection over much of land plant evolution, leading to predictable, repeatable patterns of evolution.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print411.pdf,"[( 22 Feb 2015 , 1), ( 16 Feb 2015 , 2), ( 13 Feb 2015 , 8), ( 26 Feb 2015 , 1)]"

A defective could be immune to the presence of an inhibitor in a test. So, a test containing a defective is positive iff it does not contain its ``associated'' inhibitor. The goal of this paper is to identify the defectives, inhibitors, and their ``associations'' with high probability, or in other words, learn the Immune Defectives Graph (IDG).  We propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design, a probabilistic two-stage adaptive pooling design and decoding algorithms for learning the IDG. For the two-stage adaptive-pooling design, we show that the sample complexity of the number of tests required to guarantee recovery of the inhibitors, defectives and their associations with high probability, i.e., the upper bound, exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of items. For the non-adaptive pooling design, in the large inhibitor regime, we show that the upper bound exceeds the proposed lower bound  by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of inhibitors.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print413.pdf,"[( 11 Feb 2015 , 2), ( 12 Feb 2015 , 1)]"

We find that both forms of homeostasis provide a robust mechanism for maintaining stable activity following perturbations. However, the resulting networks differ, with diffusive homeostasis maintaining substantial heterogeneity in activity levels of individual neurons, a feature disrupted in networks with non-diffusive homeostasis. This results in networks capable of representing input heterogeneity, and linearly responding over a broader range of inputs than those undergoing non-diffusive homeostasis.

However, first generation negative selection screens using CRISPR technology demonstrate extreme variability across different cell lines.

I show that these ""harsh environments, fast life histories"" - or HEFLH - hypotheses are poorly supported by evolutionary theory. First, I use a simple model to show that effects of environmental harshness on life history evolution are incredibly diverse. In particular, small changes in basic but poorly understood variables - e.g., whether and how population density affects vital rates - can cause selection to favor very different life histories. Furthermore, I show that almost all life history theory used to justify HEFLH hypotheses is misapplied in the first place. The reason is that HEFLH hypotheses usually treat plastic responses to heterogeneous environmental conditions within a population, whereas the theory used to justify such hypotheses treat genetic responses to environmental changes across an entire population. Counter-intuitively, the predictions of the former do not generally apply to the latter: the optimal response to a harsh environment within a large heterogeneous environment is not necessarily the optimal strategy of a population uniformly inhabiting the same harsh environment.

In DNA cut & paste transposition, the element-encoded transposase performs the DNA breakage and joining reactions that excise the element from the donor site and integrate it into the new insertion site. Host factors can influence many aspects of transposition. Notably, host DNA repair factors mediate the regeneration of intact duplex DNA necessary after transposase action by repairing the double strand break in the broken donor backbone, from which the transposon has excised, and repairing the single strand gaps that flank the newly inserted transposon. We have exploited the ability of the mammalian transposon piggyBat, a member of the piggyBac superfamily, to transpose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and used the yeast single gene deletion collection to screen for genes encoding host factors involved in piggyBat transposition. piggyBac transposition is distinguished by the fact that piggyBac elements insert into TTAA target sites and also that the donor backbone is restored to its pre-transposon sequence after transposon excision, that is, excision is precise. We have found that repair of the broken donor backbone requires the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway (NHEJ). By contrast, NHEJ is not required for DNA repair at the new insertion site.

TFs are known to be generally rich in amino acid repeats or low-complexity regions (LCRs), such as polyalanine or polyglutamine runs, which can evolve rapidly and potentially influence the transcriptional activity of the protein. Here we test the hypothesis that LCRs have played a major role in the diversification of TF gene duplicates. We find that nearly half of the TF gene families (107 out of 237) originated during the 2R-WGD contain LCRs, compared to only a small percentage of the non-duplicated TF genes used as a control (15 out of 115). At the individual gene level, we observe that twice as many duplicated TFs have gained LCRs as non-duplicated TFs. In addition, duplicated TFs preferentially accumulate certain LCR types, the most prominent of which are alanine repeats. We experimentally test the role of alanine-rich LCRs in two different TF gene families, PHOX2A/PHOX2B and LHX2/LHX9. In both cases, the presence of the alanine-rich LCR in one of the copies (PHOX2B and LHX2) significantly increases the capacity of the TF to activate transcription.

To evaluate how well methods developed to detect coevolving residues within proteins can be adapted for cross-species, inter-protein analysis, we used statistical criteria to quantify the performance of these methods in detecting inter-protein residues within 8 angstroms of each other in the co-crystal structures of 33 bacterial protein interactions. We also evaluated their performance for detecting known residues at the interface of a host-virus protein complex with a partially solved structure. Our quantitative benchmarking showed that all coevolutionary methods clearly benefit from alignments with many sequences. Methods that aim to detect direct correlations generally outperform other approaches. However, faster mutual information based methods are occasionally competitive in small alignments and with relaxed false positive rates. All commonly used null distributions are anti-conservative and have high false positive rates in some scenarios, although the empirical distribution of scores performs reasonably well with deep alignments. We conclude that coevolutionary analysis of cross-species protein interactions holds great promise but requires sequencing many more species pairs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics8.pdf,"[( 06 Feb 2015 , 7), ( 22 Feb 2015 , 5)]"
