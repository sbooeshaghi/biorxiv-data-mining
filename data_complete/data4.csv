A 350-bp part of the leptin receptor coding region was amplified and sequenced and understood that the fragment contained 7 SNPs (GenBank: KP674322.1-KP674328.1) that were detected in 5 loci (T3216C, T3265C, T3265G, C3265G, T3303C, A3311G, and T3347C) in a total of 30 individuals. The T3216C and T3303C SNPs located at the end of the codon were synonymous and did not affect the presence of proline. However, phenylalanine, leucine and valine were produced when the T3265C, T3265G and C3265G SNPs, respectively, were present. Glutamine or arginine was produced when the A3311G SNP was A or G, respectively, and serine was produced when the T3347C SNP was C. Although codons and amino acid sequences changed due to the second SNP, the secondary protein structure was not changed. However, the fourth and fifth SNPs changed both the amino acid sequences and secondary protein structure. 
Pairing the SNP loci with phenotypic traits created haplogroups. When all individuals were evaluated together, some of the differences between the haplogroups were statistically significant (p<0.05; p<0.01). These results showed that both the sequence and structure of the leptin receptor gene could be altered by long-term selection. However, to achieve a more precise understanding of the role of leptin, entire coding sequences of leptin and the leptin receptor should be studied.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1256.pdf,"[( 12 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 20 Mar 2016 , 5)]"

Here, the genomic sequences of two nosocomial isolates that caused neonatal meningitis in Bangui, Central African Republic, were determined and compared with Elizabethkingia isolates from other world regions and sources. Average nucleotide identity firmly confirmed that E. anophelis, E. meningoseptica and E. miricola represent distinct genomic species and led to re-identification of several strains. Phylogenetic analysis of E. anophelis strains revealed several sublineages and demonstrated a single evolutionary origin of African clinical isolates, which carry unique antimicrobial resistance genes acquired by horizontal transfer. The Elizabethkingia genus and the species E. anophelis had pan-genomes comprising respectively 7,801 and 6,880 gene families, underlining their genomic heterogeneity. African isolates were capsulated and carried a distinctive capsular polysaccharide synthesis cluster. A core-genome multilocus sequence typing scheme applicable to all Elizabethkingia isolates was developed, made publicly available (http://bigsdb.web.pasteur.fr/elizabethkingia), and shown to provide useful insights into E. anophelis epidemiology. Furthermore, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus was uncovered in E. meningoseptica, E. miricola and in a few E. anophelis strains.

In this study, we have looked for patterns governing the transition to clinical invasion in the largest screen of clinical yeast isolates to date. In particular, we have focused on the hypothesis that ploidy changes have influenced adaptive processes. We sequenced 145 yeast strains, 132 of which are clinical isolates.

Consequently, deregulated signaling is involved in a range of human diseases including cancer and developmental defects. A better understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanism and effect of physiological (active) and pathophysiological (hyperactive) WNT signaling is important for predicting treatment response and developing novel therapies. The constitutively expressed CTNNB1 (commonly and hereafter referred to as β-catenin) is degraded by a destruction complex, composed of amongst other AXIN1 and GSK3. The destruction complex is inhibited during active signaling leading to β-catenin stabilization and induction of β-catenin/TCF target genes. In this study we investigated the mechanism and effect of β-catenin stabilization during active and hyperactive WNT signaling in a combined in silico and in vitro approach. We constructed a Petri net model of Wnt/β-catenin signaling including main players from the plasma membrane (WNT ligands and receptors), cytoplasmic effectors and the downstream negative feedback target gene AXIN2. We simulated the model with active (i.e. WNT stimulation) and hyperactive (i.e. GSK3 inhibition) signaling, which led to the following observations: 1) A dose- and time-dependent response was observed for both WNT stimulation and GSK3 inhibition. 2) The Wnt-pathway activity was 2-fold higher for GSK3 inhibition compared to WNT stimulation. Both of these observations were corroborated by TCF/LEF luciferase reporter assays. Using this experimentally validated model we simulated the effect of the negative feedback regulator AXIN2 upon WNT stimulation and observed an attenuated β-catenin stabilization. We furthermore simulated the effect of APC inactivating mutations, yielding a stabilization of β-catenin levels comparable to the Wnt-pathway activities observed in colorectal and breast cancer.

There is currently no method to dynamically control flies' access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner. This method is still commonly used in the analysis of learning, memory, addiction, feeding, and many other subjects in experimental psychology. The difficulty of microscale food delivery means this is not a technique used in fly behavior. In the present manuscript we describe a microfluidic chip integrated with machine vision and automation to dynamically control defined liquid food presentations and sensory stimuli.

We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms, and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that respectively (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment, and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually become equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs on maintaining plasticity.

Restriction of interspecific gene flow may often be achieved by gradual accumulation of intrinsic postzygotic incompatibilities with hybrid infertility typically evolving more rapidly than inviability. A reconstructed history of speciation in European loaches (Cobitis) reveals that accumulation of postzygotic reproductive incompatibilities may take an alternative, in the literature largely neglected, pathway through initiation of hybrids' asexuality rather than through a decrease in hybrids' fitness. Combined evidence shows that contemporary Cobitis species readily hybridize in hybrid zones, but their gene pools are isolated as hybridization produces infertile males and fertile but clonally reproducing females that cannot mediate introgressions. Nevertheless, coalescent analyses indicated intensive historical gene flow during earlier stages of Cobitis diversification, suggesting that non-clonal hybrids must have existed in the past. The revealed patterns imply that during the initial stages of speciation, hybridization between little diverged species produced recombinant hybrids mediating gene flow, but growing divergence among species caused disrupted meiosis in hybrids resulting in their clonality, which acts as a barrier to gene flow. Comparative analysis of published data on other fish hybrids corroborated the generality of our findings; the species pairs producing asexual hybrids were more genetically diverged than those pairs producing fertile sexual hybrids but less diverged than species pairs producing infertile hybrids.

Experimental studies have shown that the fitness of Synechococcus elongatus, a photosynthetic microorganism, is severely affected in non-24h environments. However, it has been difficult to study the effects of clock-environment mismatch on cellular physiology because such measurements require the precise determination of both clock state and growth rates in the same cell. Here, we designed a microscopy platform that allows us to expose cyanobacterial cells to pulses of light and dark while quantitatively measuring their growth, division rate, and circadian clock state over many days. Our measurements reveal that decreased fitness can result from a catastrophic growth arrest caused by unexpected darkness in a small subset of cells with incorrect clock times corresponding to the subjective morning. We find that the clock generates rhythms in the instantaneous growth rate of the cell, and that time of darkness vulnerability coincides with the time of most rapid growth. Thus, the clock mediates a fundamental trade-off between growth and starvation tolerance in cycling environments. By measuring the response of the circadian rhythm to dark pulses of varying lengths, we constrain a mathematical model of a population's fitness under arbitrary light/dark schedules. This model predicts that the circadian clock is only advantageous in highly regular cycling environments with frequencies sufficiently close to the natural frequency of the clock.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Biophysical Journal/Biophysical Journal9.pdf,"[( 26 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 22 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 10), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Among them, RAD-sequencing is one of the most widely used. It relies on digesting DNA with specific restriction enzymes and performing size selection on the resulting fragments. Despite its acknowledged utility, this method is of limited use with degraded DNA samples, such as those isolated from museum specimens, as these samples are less likely to harbor fragments long enough to comprise two restriction sites making possible ligation of the adapter sequences (in the case of double-digest RAD) or performing size selection of the resulting fragments (in the case of single-digest RAD). Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel method called hybridization RAD (hyRAD). In this approach, biotinylated RAD fragments, covering a random fraction of the genome, are used as baits for capturing homologous fragments from genomic shotgun sequencing libraries. This simple and cost-effective approach allows sequencing of orthologous loci even from highly degraded DNA samples, opening new avenues of research in the field of museum genomics. Not relying on the restriction site presence, it improves among-sample loci coverage. In a trial study, hyRAD allowed us to obtain a large set of orthologous loci from fresh and museum samples from a non-model butterfly species, with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms present in all eight analyzed specimens, including 58-year-old museum samples.  The utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Palearctic grasshopper species for which the spatial genetic structure was previously assessed using mtDNA amplicons. The application of the method is eventually discussed in a wider context. As it does not rely on the restriction site presence, it is therefore not sensitive to among-sample loci polymorphisms in the restriction sites that usually causes loci dropout.

Bracoviruses allow wasps to reproductively co-opt other insect larvae. Bracoviruses are excised from the host genome and injected in to the larva along side the wasp eggs; where they encode proteins that lower host immunity allowing development of parasitoid wasp larvae in the host.

Heuristics which implicitly address this problem have emerged in quality control measures to obtain 'good' differential expression results. However, these methods involve strict filters such as discarding low expressing genes or using technical replicates to remove discordant transcripts, and are costly or simply ad hoc. As an alternative, we model gene-level replicability of differential activity using co-expressing genes. We find that sets of housekeeping interactions provide a sensitive means of estimating the replicability of expression changes, where the co-expressing pair can be regarded as pseudo-replicates of one another. We model the effects of noise that perturbs a gene's expression within its usual distribution of values and show that perturbing expression by only 5% within that range is readily detectable (AUROC~0.73).

Greater similarity of DNA methylation levels between the sexes was found to be consistent with bi-allelic activity at these escTSSs. The significant over-representations of YY1 transcription factor binding motif and ChIP-seq peaks around escTSSs highlighted its positive association with escapees.

As only the thin section of the specimen at the focal plane of the lens is illuminated, out of focus light is naturally absent and toxicity due to light (phototoxicity) is greatly reduced enabling longer term live imaging.  OpenSPIM is an open access platform (Pitrone et al. 2013 and OpenSPIM.org) created to give new users step by step instructions on building a basic configuration of a SPIM microscope, which can in principle be adapted and upgraded to each laboratorys own requirements and budget. Here we describe our own experience with the process of designing, building, configuring and using an OpenSPIM for our research into the early development of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri, a non model animal. 
RESULTS: Our OpenSPIM builds on the standard design with the addition of two colour laser illumination for simultaneous detection of two probes/molecules and dual sided illumination, which provides more even signal intensity across a specimen. Our OpenSPIM provides high resolution 3d images and time lapse recordings, and we demonstrate the use of two colour lasers and the benefits of two color dual-sided imaging.  We used our microscope to study the development of the embryo of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri.  The capabilities of our microscope are demonstrated by our ability to record the stereotypical spiral cleavage pattern of Maritigrella with high speed multi view time lapse imaging. 3D and 4D (3D and time) reconstruction of early development from these data is possible using image registration and deconvolution tools provided as part of the open source Fiji platform. We discuss our findings on the pros and cons of a self built microscope.

Here we show how specific removal of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24% in regions canonically associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts (40-149%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. This effect size boosting is primarily a consequence of reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level, which then translates into consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level. Power simulations demonstrate that enhanced effect size enables highly-powered studies at traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could help issues regarding statistical power and non-BOLD noise and enable potential for novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are currently under-appreciated and not well understood.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/NeuroImage/NeuroImage14.pdf,"[( 11 May 2015 , 1), ( 31 Mar 2015 , 1), ( 01 Apr 2015 , 3), ( 22 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 10 May 2015 , 1), ( 19 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 25 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 11 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 10 Apr 2015 , 2), ( 12 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 09 Jul 2015 , 1), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 17 Oct 2015 , 1)]"

Applying PEP to RNA-seq data consisting of 657 samples from 309 diverse unicellular eukaryotes, we found several hundred gene sets evolving in a coordinated fashion. These allowed us to predict a role of the Golgi apparatus in Alzheimer's disease, as well as novel genes related to diabetes pathways. We also detected adaptive evolution of tRNA ligase levels to match genome-wide codon usage. In sum, we found that PEP is an effective method for inferring functional relationships - especially among core cellular components that are never lost, to which phylogenetic profiling cannot be applied - and that many subunits of the most conserved molecular machines are coexpressed across eukaryotes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1269.pdf,"[( 28 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 9), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

We apply this model to the adult intestinal stem cell (ISC) of Drosophila, whose fate is stochastic but dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. We observe a correlation between signalling state in cell pairs and their contact area. We interpret this behaviour in terms of the properties of our model in the presence of population variability in signalling thresholds.

Due to limited throughput in fitness measurements, previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, however, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20L, L being the length of the relevant sequence) and there may be higher-order interactions among more than two sites. To study how these features impact the course of protein evolution, we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in the IgG-binding domain of protein G, containing 204 = 160,000 variants. We found that the fitness landscape was rugged and direct paths of adaptation were often constrained by pairwise epistasis. However, while direct paths were blocked by reciprocal sign epistasis, we found systematic evidence that such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by ""extra-dimensional bypass"". Extra dimensions in sequence space - with a different amino acid at the site of interest or an additional interacting site - open up indirect paths of adaptation via gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These indirect paths alleviate the constraint on reaching high fitness genotypes via selectively accessible trajectories, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may completely change our views on how proteins evolve.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife55.pdf,"[( 22 Mar 2016 , 9), ( 23 Mar 2016 , 6), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 25 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Evaluation of patterns of nucleotide diversity in and near genes shows little evidence of selection on beneficial amino acid substitutions, and that the domestication bottleneck led to a decline in the efficiency of purifying selection in maize.

In D. melanogaster several lncRNAs involved in regulating Hox gene expression in the Bithorax Complex have been reported. However, no functional Hox long noncoding RNAs have been described in the Antennapedia Complex. Here we have characterized a long noncoding RNA lincX from the Antennapedia Complex, that is transcribed from previously identified cis-regulatory sequences of the Hox gene Sex combs reduced (Scr). We use both the GAL4-UAS system and mutants to ectopically overexpress the lincX RNA from exogenous and endogenous loci respectively, in order to dissect the potential regulatory functions of lincX RNA versus lincX transcription. Our findings suggest that transcription through the lincX locus, but not the lincX RNA itself, may facilitate initiation of Scr in cis in the early embryo. Transvection phenomena, where regulatory sequences on one chromosome can affect expression on the homolog, have previously been reported in genetic studies of Scr. By analysing lincX and Scr nascent transcriptional sites in embryos heterozygous for a gain of function mutation, we directly visualize this transvection, and observe that the ectopic lincX transcriptional state appears to be relayed in trans to the homologous wild-type chromosome. This trans-activation of lincX correlates with both ectopic activation of Scr in cis, and increased chromosomal proximity.

effects. However, the underlying key mechanism of action of resveratrol
remained largely controversial. Here, we demonstrate that under physiologically
relevant conditions major biological effects of resveratrol can be attributed to the
generation of oxidation products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At low
hormetic concentrations (< 50 μM), treatment with resveratrol increased cell viability
in a set of representative cell models, whereas application of quenchers of ROS
completely truncated these beneficial effects. Notably, application of resveratrol led
to mild, Nrf2-specific cellular gene expression reprogramming. For example, in
primary human epidermal keratinocytes this resulted in a 1.3-fold increase of
endogenous metabolites such as gluthathione (GSH) and subsequently in a
quantitative reduction of the cellular redox environment by 2.61 mV mmol GSH (g
protein)-1. In particular in resveratrol pre-treated cells, after external application of
oxidative stress by using 0.8 % ethanol, endogenous ROS generation was
consequently reduced by 24 %. In contrast to the common perception that resveratrol
acts mainly as a chemical antioxidant or as a target protein-specific ligand, we
propose that effects from resveratrol treatment are essentially based on oxidative
triggering of cells. In relevant physiological microenvironments this effect can lead to
hormetic shifting of cellular defence towards a more reductive state to improve
resilience to oxidative stress in a manner that can be exactly defined by the redoxenvironment

In single-genotype populations, this allows for observing the effects of standing variation on the process of developmental plasticity. Typically, such efforts do not allow us to distinguish the effect of genotype from the effects of environment. In the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, however, the L1 stage of development allows for precise and controlled imposition of starvation on a synchronized population of individuals. This allows for systematic comparisons within and between defined genotypes. 

This study provides a number of innovations in the study of Nematode developmental plasticity. The first is to demonstrate systems-level mechanisms of adaptive response for various genetic mutant phenotypes to extended L1 arrest. The effects of developmental deprivation are quantifiable by applying statistical modeling techniques to reproductive time-series. This is characterized for both a wildtype strain (N2) and a host of genetic mutant strains. A further contribution is investigating the effects of starvation at multi-generational timescales. This includes both two generations post-starvation and multiple starvation experiences with selection for fecundity over 11 generations. 

Statistical techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), fold-change analysis, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis reveal differences from baseline in the form of shifts in reproductive timing and kurtosis in peak reproductive capacity characterize adaptive responses that are semi-independent of environment. Extending these patterns of response to ad hoc comparisons with multi-generational contexts reveals that different genotypes characterized by mutations of specific genetic loci lead to vastly different outcomes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1277.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 06 May 2016 , 1), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 6)]"

Recombination allows adaptive mutations or genes to spread rapidly within (or even between) species, and reduces the burden of deleterious mutations. Clonality -- defined here as the balance between vertical and horizontal inheritance -- is therefore a key microbial trait, determining how quickly a population can adapt and the size of its gene pool. Here, I discuss whether clonality varies over time and if it can be considered a stable trait of a given population. I show that, in some cases, clonality is clearly not static. For example, non-clonal (highly recombining) populations can give rise to clonal expansions, often of pathogens. However, an analysis of time-course metagenomic data from a lake suggests that a bacterial population's past clonality (as measured by its genetic diversity) is a good predictor of its future clonality.

We used disruptions in Smn and two additional snRNP biogenesis genes, Phax and Ars2, to classify RNA processing differences as snRNP-dependent or Smn gene specific in Drosophila. Although more numerous, the processing changes in Ars2 mutants were generally distinct from those identified in Phax and Smn animals.

Collective animal behavior such as the flocking of birds or the shoaling of fish has inspired a class of algorithms designed to optimize distance-based clusters in various applications including document analysis and DNA microarrays. In the flocking model, individual agents respond only to their immediate environment and move according to a few simple rules. After several iterations the agents self-organize and clusters emerge without the need for partitional seeds. In addition to their unsupervised nature, flocking offers several computational advantages including the potential to decrease the number of required comparisons. 

Findings
In Clusterflock, we implement a flocking algorithm designed to find groups (flocks) of orthologous gene families (OGFs) that share a common evolutionary history. Pairwise distances that measure the phylogenetic incongruence between OGFs guide flock formation. We test this approach on several simulated datasets varying the number of underlying topologies, the proportion of missing data, and evolutionary rates, and show that in datasets containing high levels of missing data and rate heterogeneity, clusterflock outperforms other well-established clustering techniques. We also demonstrate its utility on a known, large-scale recombination event in Staphylococcus aureus. By isolating sets of OGFs with divergent phylogenetic signal, we can pinpoint the recombined region without forcing a pre-determined number of groupings or defining a pre-determined incongruence threshold.  

Conclusions
Clusterflock is an open source tool that can be used to discover horizontally transferred genes, recombining areas of chromosomes, and the phylogenetic 'core' of a genome. Though we use it in an evolutionary context, it is generalizable to any clustering problem. Users can write extensions to calculate any distance metric on the unit interval and use these distances to flock any type of data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/GigaScience/GigaScience13.pdf,"[( 27 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 11 Jan 2017 , 4), ( 02 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 25 Mar 2016 , 11), ( 03 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 12 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 26 Mar 2016 , 11), ( 04 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 28 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 01 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

Here, we experimentally manipulated the OSR and habitat complexity and quantified sexual selection on male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki).

We implemented trans-acting GTP into a computational model for microtubule dynamics. In simulations, growing microtubules often exposed terminal GDP-bound subunits without undergoing catastrophe. Transient GDP exposure on the growing plus end slowed elongation by reducing the number of favorable binding sites on the microtubule end. Slower elongation led to erosion of the GTP cap and an increase in the frequency of catastrophe. Allowing GDP to GTP exchange on terminal subunits in simulations mitigated these effects. Using mutant αβ-tubulin or modified GTP, we showed experimentally that a more readily exchangeable nucleotide led to less frequent catastrophe.

First, when reduplicated polytene chromosomes persist into metaphase, an anaphase delay prevents tissue malformation and apoptosis. Second, reduplicated polytene chromosomes can also separate prior to metaphase through a spindle-independent mechanism termed Separation-Into-Recent-Sisters (SIRS).

Some of these 'hidden costs' accrue due to cryptic morphological and physiological changes. In mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), males with limited food intake early in life delay maturation to eventually reach a similar adult body size to their well-fed counterparts ('catch-up growth'). Here we tested whether a poor diet early in life incurs hidden costs due to reduced expression of sexually selected male traits (genital size and ejaculate traits). We found that diet early in life significantly influenced sperm reserves and replenishment rate due to age and development-rate dependent effects.

To reflect the continuous nature of gene expression observed, we developed a quantitative score (Continuous Linear Enhanced Assessment of Renal cell carcinoma, or CLEAR) using expression analysis founded on pathologic parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 265 ccRCC gene expression profiles were used to develop the CLEAR score, representing a genetic correlate of the continuum of morphological tumor grade. A signature derivation method based on correlation of CLEAR score with gene expression ranking was used to derive an 18-transcript signature. External validation was conducted in multiple public expression datasets.
Results: As a measure of intertumoral gene expression heterogeneity, the CLEAR score demonstrated both superior prognostic estimates (94% vs 83% adequacy index in TCGA dataset) and inverse correlation with anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibition (65% vs 55% adequacy index) in comparison to previously proposed discrete subtyping classifications. Inverse correlation with high-dose interleukin-2 outcomes was also observed for the CLEAR score (p=0.05). Multiple somatic mutations (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, TP53, BAP1, PTEN, MTOR) were associated with the CLEAR score. Application of the CLEAR score to independent expression profiling of intratumoral ccRCC regions demonstrated its ability to reflect intratumoral expression heterogeneity and further analysis showed average intertumoral heterogeneity exceeded intratumoral heterogeneity.
Conclusions: The CLEAR score, a gene expression signature developed on histopathology, outperformed discrete subtype-classification in prognostic estimates and correlated better with treatment outcomes.

genetic backgrounds, we used an experimental evolution protocol to evolve 14 distinct genetic
strains over 15-20 generations. Beginning with three founder worms for each strain, we were able
to generate 790 distinct genealogies, which provided information on both the effects of natural
selection and the evolvability of each strain. Among these genotypes are a wildtype (N2) and a
collection of mutants with targeted mutations in the daf-c, daf-d, and AMPK pathways. The
overarching goal of our analysis is two-fold: to observe differences in reproductive fitness and
observe related changes in reproductive timing. This yields two outcomes. The first is that the
majority of selective effects on fecundity occur during the first few generations of evolution, while
the negative selection for reproductive timing occurs on longer timescales. The second finding
reveals that positive selection on fecundity results in positive and negative selection on
reproductive timing, both of which are strain-dependent. Using a derivative of population size per
generation called the reproductive carry-over (RCO) measure, it is found that the fluctuation and
shape of the probability distribution may be informative in terms of developmental selection.
While these consist of general patterns that transcend mutations in a specific gene, changes in the RCO measure may nevertheless be products of selection. In conclusion, we discuss the broader
implications of these findings, particularly in the context of genotype-fitness maps and the role of
uncharacterized mutations in individual variation and evolvability.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Royal Society Open Science/Royal Society Open Science3.pdf,"[( 27 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 03 Mar 2016 , 9)]"

Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories anchored globally to the nest or visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, they largely neglected evidence for possible neural substrates underlying the generated behavior. Therefore, we present here a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in embodied agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global and local vector learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agent's current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In simulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. This provides an explanation for, how view-based navigational strategies are guided by path integration. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated embodied agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1286.pdf,"[( 27 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 4), ( 25 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 26 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 31 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 28 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

The SDR of this ZW system is located within a 280kb window, in which the maternal recombination rate is lower than the paternal. In contrast to the SDR, the maternal PAR recombination rate is much higher than the rates of the paternal PAR or autosomes, culminating in an elevated chromosome-wide rate.

Cell characterizations initially focused on two different protein systems, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex and cytokeratin (CK) filaments. Hybridization experiments using pan and allele-specific HLA antibody probes showed that surface antigens on cells transferred from the palmar surface of volunteers are largely unreactive, suggesting that they cannot be used to differentiate cell populations in a touch mixture. Touch samples were also hybridized with the pan-CK probe AE1, which targets CK proteins 10, 14, 15, 16 and 19. Fluorescence levels of AE1 hybridized cells were observed to vary across donors, although these differences were not consistent across all sampling days.  We then investigated variations in red autofluorescence profiles (650-670nm) as a potential signature for distinguishing contributor cell populations. Although distinct differences in red autofluorescence profiles were observed -- with one donor consistently exhibiting higher levels of fluorescence than others -- some variation was also observed in touch samples collected from the same individual on different days.  While this suggests that contributor touch samples cannot be defined by a discrete level of autofluorescence, this attribute may still be a useful means of isolating contributors to some touch mixtures. To test whether these observed optical differences could potentially be used as the basis for a cell separation workflow, a controlled two person touch mixture was separated into two fractions via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using gating criteria based on intensity of 650-670nm emissions, and then subjected to DNA analysis.

The loving kindness meditation was associated with significant increases in delta, alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta power compared to baseline, while prayer induced significant increases in power of alpha 1 and gamma oscillations, together with an increase in the gamma: theta ratio. An increase in delta activity occurred during the loving kindness meditation but not during prayer.

Some genotype callers, such as GATK and SAMtools, directly calculate the base-calling error rates from  phred  scores or recalibrated base quality scores. Others, such as SeqEM, estimate error rates from the read data without using any quality scores. It is also a common quality control procedure to filter out reads with low  phred  scores. However, choosing an appropriate  phred  score threshold is problematic as a too-high threshold may lose data while a too-low threshold may introduce errors.
We propose a new likelihood-based genotype-calling approach that exploits all reads and estimates the per-base error rates by incorporating  phred  scores through a logistic regression model. The algorithm, which we call PhredEM, uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain consistent estimates of genotype frequencies and logistic regression parameters. We also develop a simple, computationally efficient screening algorithm to identify loci that are estimated to be monomorphic, so that only loci estimated to be non-monomorphic require application of the EM algorithm. We evaluate the performance of PhredEM using both simulated data and real sequencing data from the UK10K project.

With the development of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, scRNA-seq experiments with ordered conditions (e.g. time-course) are becoming common. Methods developed for analyzing ordered bulk RNA-seq experiments are not applicable to scRNA-seq, since their distributional assumptions are often violated by additional heterogeneities prevalent in scRNA-seq.
Here we present SCPattern - an empirical Bayes model to characterize genes with expression changes in ordered scRNA-seq experiments. SCPattern utilizes the non-parametrical Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, thus it has the flexibility to identify genes with a wide variety of types of changes. Additionally, the Bayes framework allows SCPattern to classify genes into expression patterns with probability estimates.

Results:
Simulation results show that SCPattern is well powered for identifying genes with expression changes while the false discovery rate is well controlled. SCPattern is also able to accurately classify these dynamic genes into directional expression patterns. Applied to a scRNA-seq time course dataset studying human embryonic cell differentiation, SCPattern detected a group of important genes that are involved in mesendoderm and definitive endoderm cell fate decisions, positional patterning, and cell cycle.

It is also unclear why ASD shows such high prevalence within human populations. Interestingly, the emergence of a modern faculty of language has been hypothesised to be linked to changes in the human brain/skull, but also to the process of self-domestication of the human species. It is our intention to show that people with ASD exhibit less marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also discuss many ASD candidates represented among the genes known to be involved in the domestication syndrome (the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated mammals, which seemingly results from the hypofunction of the neural crest) and among the set of genes involved in language function closely connected to them. Moreover, many of these genes show altered expression profiles in the brain of autists. In addition, some candidates for domestication and language-readiness show the same expression profile in people with ASD and chimps in different brain areas involved in language processing. Similarities regarding the brain oscillatory behaviour of these areas can be expected too.

To identify proteins that act in dense-core vesicle biogenesis, we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for mutants defective in dense-core vesicle function. We previously reported the identification of two conserved proteins that interact with the small GTPase RAB-2 to control normal dense-core vesicle cargo-sorting. Here we identify several additional conserved factors important for dense-core vesicle cargo sorting: the WD40 domain protein EIPR-1 and the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex. By assaying behavior and the trafficking of dense-core vesicle cargos, we show that mutants that lack EIPR-1 or EARP have defects in dense-core vesicle cargo-sorting similar to those of mutants in the RAB-2 pathway. Genetic epistasis data indicate that RAB-2, EIPR-1 and EARP function in a common pathway. In addition, using a proteomic approach in rat insulinoma cells, we show that EIPR-1 physically interacts with the EARP complex.

Recurrent debates on the dynamics and stability of complex systems have enriched our understanding of these systems, but generalities in the relationship between structure and dynamics are hard to come by. Although traditionally an arena for theoreticians, much of this research has been invigorated by demonstration of the existence of alternate stable equilibria in real world ecosystems such as lakes, coral reefs, forests and grasslands. Linking up systems thinking with recent advances in our understanding of ecological networks opens up exciting possibilities. In an attempt to obtain general patterns of behaviour of complex systems, we have analyzed the response of eighty-six real world ecological networks to targeted extinctions, and the findings suggest that most networks are robust to loss of specialists until specific thresholds are reached in terms of geodesics. If the extinctions persist, a state change or flip occurs and the structural properties are altered drastically, although the network does not collapse. Further, we find that as opposed to simpler networks, larger networks have several such alternate states that ensure their long-term persistence and that indeed complexity does endow resilience to such networks.

Imperfect subject network estimates can compromise subsequent efforts to detect covariate effects on network structure. We address this problem in the case of Gaussian graphical models of functional connectivity, by proposing novel two-level models that treat both subject level networks and population level covariate effects as unknown parameters. To account for imperfectly estimated subject level networks when fitting these models, we propose two related approaches: R2 based on resampling and random effects test statistics, and R3 that additionally employs random adaptive penalization.

Diarrhea remains one of the main killers of children aged below five years. Traditional antidiarrheal remedies form a potentially viable source of novel low cost efficacious antidiarrheal remedies in low resource settings. There is therefore a pressing to scientifically evaluate these remedies. 
 
Aim of the study; 
This study aimed to investigate the ″in-vivo″ and ″in-vitro″ antidiarrheal activity of Bidens biternata a herb species used in traditional Indian medicine in the management of diarrhea. 
Materials and Methods;
In the castor oil test twenty (20) adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (normal saline), positive control (5 mg/kg loperamide), (200 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) and (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups (n=5 in each group). Castor oil (4 ml/kg) was then administered to the animals one hour after administration of the respective treatments after which the total mass of fecal output excreted after four (4) hours was determined.
 In the charcoal meal test fifteen (15) Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (normal saline 5 ml/kg orally), the positive control (atropine sulphate 0.1 mg/kg i.p) and test (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups (n=5). Charcoal meal was then administered via oral gavage to each rat thirty (30) minutes after the administration of the various treatments. The distance covered by the charcoal meal from the pylorus was then determined after sacrifice of the animals.
In the enteropooling test twenty (20) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (5% v/v ethanol in normal saline), positive control (5 mg/kg loperamide) and test (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (100μg/kg) administered immediately after the treatments.  The animals were then sacrificed half an hour later and the volume of the small intestine contents determined.
The effects of different concentrations of Bidens biternata extract (0.5. 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mg/ml) on jejunal contraction were investigated and a dose-response curve constructed using the experimental data after which The ED50 dose determined. The effect of tamsulosin (α1 adrenergic blocker), yohimbine (α2 adrenergic blocker), propranolol (βadrenergic blocker) and naloxone (μopioid blocker) on the contractile activity of the extract were also investigated. 
The experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) and then analyzed  using one way ANOVA followed by Tukey′s post hoc test in cases of significance (set at p<0.05).
Results 
The freeze dried extracts of Bidens biternata had significant antidiarrheal effects in the castor oil induced diarrhea model (p=0.0075) with maximal activity being observed at the 400mg/kg dosage level (1.66± 0.81g vs. 4.54 ± 0.51 g negative control, p=0.01). Bidens biternata extract had significant effects on intestinal motility in the charcoal meal test compared to the control group (43.61 ± 4.42% vs. 60.54 ± 3.33%: p= 0.02).  Bidens biternata extract had a significant effect on PGE2 induced enteropooling (3.06 ± 0.07 ml vs. 4.74 ± 0.10 ml; p<0.001).
The freeze dried extracts of Bidens biternata had a significant negative effect on the contractility of the isolated rabbit jejunum (p<0.001). The effects of the extract were significantly attenuated by tamsulosin (53.94 ± 4.20% vs. 80.57 ± 4.09%; p=0.0067) and naloxone (53.94 ± 4.20% vs. 73.89 ± 7.26 %; p=0.0358). Yohimbine (p=0.4598) and propranolol (p=0.5966) however did not have any significant effect on the contractile activity of the extract. 
Conclusions
The freeze dried extract of Bidens biternata possess significant antidiarrheal activity in both ″in vitro″ and ″in vivo″ models which appears to be mediated by modulating both the intestinal motility as well as the secretory activity. The results of this study also validate its traditional use as an antidiarrheal remedy.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Ethnopharmacology/Journal of Ethnopharmacology1.pdf,"[( 30 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Extrapolating insights from deep investigation of a handful of developmentally important Drosophila genes to understanding the regulation of all genes is a major challenge. The developing embryo provides a unique opportunity to study the role of gene expression in pattern specification; the precise and consistent spatial positioning of key transcription factors essentially provides separate transcriptional-readout experiments at a critical point in development.

We cryosectioned and sequenced mRNA from single Drosophila melanogaster embryos at the blastoderm stage to screen for spatially-varying regulation of transcription. Expanding on our previous screening of wild type embryos, here we present data from dosage mutants for key maternally provided regulators, including depletion of zelda and hunchback and both over-expression and depletion of bicoid. These data recapitulate all of the expected patterning changes driven by these regulators; for instance, we show spatially-confined up-regulation of expression in the bicoid over-expression condition, and down-regulation of those genes in the bicoid knock-down case, consistent with bicoid's known function as an anterior-localized activator.

Our data highlight the role of combinatorial regulation of patterning gene expression. When comparing changes in multiple conditions, genes responsive to one mutation tend to respond to other mutations in a similar fashion.

Although metatranscriptomics - the study of diverse microbial population activity based on RNA-seq data - is rapidly growing in popularity, there are limited options for biologists to analyze this type of data. Current approaches for processing metatranscriptomes rely on restricted databases and a dedicated computing cluster, or metagenome-based approaches that have not been fully evaluated for processing metatranscriptomic datasets. We created a new bioinformatics pipeline, SAMSA, designed specifically for metatranscriptome dataset analysis, which runs either in-house or in conjunction with Metagenome-RAST (MG-RAST) servers. Designed for use by researchers with relatively little bioinformatics experience, SAMSA offers a breakdown of metatranscriptome activity by organism or transcript function, and is fully open source. We next used this new tool to evaluate best practices for sequencing stool metatranscriptomes.

Results
Working with the MG-RAST annotation server, we constructed the Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) software package, a complete pipeline for the analysis of gut microbiome data. In creating this package, we determined optimal parameters in data collection and processing. SAMSA can summarize and evaluate raw annotation results, identifying abundant species and significant functional differences between metatranscriptomes.

Using pilot data and simulated subsets, we determined experimental requirements for fecal gut metatranscriptomes. Sequences need to be either long reads (longer than 100bp) or paired-end reads that can be joined. Each sample nees 40-50 million raw sequences which can be expected to yield the 5-10 million annotated reads necessary for accurate abundance measures. We also demonstrated that ribosomal RNA depletion does not equally deplete ribosomes from all species within a sample, and remaining rRNA sequences should be discarded. Using publicly available metatranscriptome data in which rRNA was not depleted, we were able to demonstrate that organism activity can be measured using mRNA counts. We were also able to detect significant differences between control and experimental groups in both organism activity and functional activity.

Conclusions
By making this new pipeline publicly available, we have created a powerful new tool for metatranscriptomics research, offering a new method for greater insight into the activity of diverse microbial communities. We further recommend that stool metatranscriptomes be ribodepleted and sequenced in a 100bp paired end format with a minimum of 40 million reads per sample.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics27.pdf,"[( 31 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 30 Mar 2016 , 16), ( 01 Apr 2016 , 8), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

PCR clonal artefacts originating from NGS library preparation can affect both genomic as well as RNA-Seq applications when protocols are pushed to their limits. In RNA-Seq however the artifactual reads are not easy to tell apart from normal read duplication due to natural over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for NGS data sets. Up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for RNA-Seq data.

Results:
Here we present the tool dupRadar, which provides an easy means to distinguish artefactual from natural duplicate reads in RNA-Seq data. dupRadar assesses the fraction of duplicate reads per gene dependent on the expression level.

Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics67.pdf,"[( 03 May 2016 , 2), ( 12 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 20 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 03 Nov 2015 , 8), ( 08 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 4), ( 01 Nov 2015 , 13), ( 22 Nov 2015 , 3), ( 30 Mar 2016 , 12), ( 17 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 13 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 27 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 04 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 31 Oct 2015 , 22), ( 30 Oct 2015 , 17), ( 02 Nov 2015 , 7), ( 31 Mar 2016 , 2), ( 16 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

We apply the principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) in vivo to show the effect of a constraint field on tumor growth. The human breast cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly surrounded the growing tumor.
Two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as bioactuators, applying a constraint field and, by consequence, biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was measured two times a week. There was a significant in vivo difference between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 + population): (529 [346; 966] mm3 vs 1334 [256; 2106] mm3; p=0.015), treated mice having smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population).
On ex vivo examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups: G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59 population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6 [3.0; 42.4] mm2, p=0.005) than in G2 (20.8 [4.9; 34.3]), G3 (16.5 [13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 [1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 [1.9; 29.2] mm2, p=0.015) than in G2 (25.0 [5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 [14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5 [1.5; 51.8]).

Here we ask where is the locus of adaptation from the perspective of ecological genomics (ecogen) and evolutionary developmental biology (evodevo). Ecogen focuses on identifying loci under selection between populations living in different environments by scanning genome-wide patterns of genetic divergence, while evodevo focuses on candidate developmental regulatory genes and networks underlying phenotypic differences between species and higher taxa. We attempt to reconcile these alternative perspectives by studying the response of ant populations to past climate change on the Arizona Sky Islands, which are high elevation mountain ranges that represents a replicated natural experiment. We previously showed that adaptation to climatic changes in the Arizona Sky Islands in ant species Monomorium emersoni occurred through repeatable changes within the gene network underlying the development of dispersal alternative phenotypes: winged and wingless queens. Here, we uncover several loci under positive selection which associate with habitat temperature, a pattern consistent with a predictable and repeated increase in frequency following climatic changes on each of the Sky Islands. Furthermore, we show that gene flow between locations within a Sky Island is not a consequence of dispersal phenotypes and its gene network, but rather, is restricted by temperature adaptation along the ecological gradient. This suggests that the determination of winged and wingless queens may be developmentally plastic, and this plasticity and may facilitate jumps between adaptive peaks on the fitness landscape.

Here we used a newly developed, high-resolution multi-parameter mapping technique in 48 healthy individuals to delineate quantitative markers of in vivo histological features underlying metacognitive ability. Specifically, we examined how neuroimaging markers of local grey matter myelination, macromolecular and iron content relate to insight. Extending previous volumetric findings, we found that metacognitive ability, as determined by a signal-detection theoretic model, was positively related to the myelo-architectural integrity of aPFC grey matter. Interestingly, perceptual metacognition predicted decreased macromolecule content coupled with increased iron in the hippocampus and precuneus, areas previously implicated in meta-memory rather than meta-perception. Further, the relationship of hippocampal-precuneus and prefrontal microstructure to an auditory memory measure was respectively mediated or suppressed by metacognitive ability, suggesting a dynamic trade-off between participant's memory and metacognition.

Therefore we evaluated whether differences of the morphology and/or the energy metabolism of mitochondria can be observed between human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells obtained from osteoporotic patients as compared to non-osteoporotic controls.
Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from the bone marrow of senile osteoporotic and non osteoporotic patients, osteoporosis being assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. We then confirmed the stemness of the cells by FACS analysis of the expression of surface markers and by conducting multi-lineage differentiation experiments.

In addition we compared the energy metabolism of the stem cells to those of the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63.
The data show, for the first time, the applicability on stem cells of the methods used here. Furthermore, our results indicated that there are no obvious differences detectable in mitochondrial morphology between cells from osteoporotic and non osteoporotic donors and that these cells also seem to be energetically indistinguishable with unchanged rates of routine respiration and respiratory capacity as well as unaltered oxygen consumption rates linked to different respiratory complexes.

In addition, there is an increased interest in using marker annotations in genome-wide prediction and association. In this paper, we discuss an hybrid modeling methodology which combines the parametric mixed modeling approach and the non-parametric rule ensembles.

However, mutation rate is likely to vary among co-existing individuals within a population, due to genetic polymorphisms, heterogeneous environmental influences, and random physiological fluctuations. We explore the consequences of such mutation rate heterogeneity in a model allowing an arbitrary distribution of mutation rate among individuals, either with or without inheritance.  We find that variation of mutation rate about the mean results in a higher probability of producing zero or many simultaneous mutations on a genome. Moreover, it increases the frequency of higher order mutants even under ongoing mutation and selection. We gain a quantitative understanding of how this frequency depends on moments of the mutation rate distribution and selection coefficients. In particular, in a two-locus model, heterogeneity leads to a relative increase in double mutant frequency proportional to the squared coefficient of variation of the mutation rate.  Relative effect sizes increase with the number of loci. Finally, this clustering of deleterious mutations into fewer individuals results in a higher population mean fitness.  Our results imply that mutation rate heterogeneity allows a population to maintain a higher level of adaptedness to its current environment, while simultaneously harboring greater genetic diversity in the standing variation, which could be crucial for future adaptation to a new environment.

By coupling multiplex transfection of short hairpin RNA constructs with pooled amplicon sequencing as a readout, we were able to screen many genes for spermatogenesis function in a quick and inexpensive experiment. We transfected nine mouse testes with a pilot pool of RNAi against well-characterized genes to show that this system is highly reproducible and accurate.

In a separate experiment, we screened 26 uncharacterized genes computationally predicted to be essential for spermatogenesis and found numerous candidates for follow up studies. Further, by characterizing the effect of both libraries on neuronal N2a cells, we show that our screening results from testis are tissue-specific. Our calculations indicate that the current implementation of this approach could be used to screen thousands of protein-coding genes simultaneously in a single mouse testis. The experimental protocols and analysis scripts provided will enable other groups to use this procedure to study diverse aspects of germ cell biology ranging from epigenetics to cell physiology.

We observe a strong reduction in mobility early in AIS development. Membrane protein motion in the AIS plasma membrane is confined to a repetitive pattern of ~190 nm spaced segments along the AIS axis as early as DIV4 and this pattern alternates with actin rings.

Background 
Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airways, is the most common chronic disease of children worldwide. There are significant racial/ethnic disparities in asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality among U.S. children. This trend is mirrored in obesity, which may share genetic and environmental risk factors with asthma. The majority of asthma biomedical research has been performed in populations of European decent. 
Objective
We sought to identify genetic risk factors for asthma in African American children. We also assessed the generalizability of genetic variants associated with asthma in European and Asian populations to African American children. 
Methods
Our study population consisted of 1227 (812 asthma cases, 415 controls) African American children with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between SNP genotype and asthma status. 
Results 
We identified a novel variant in the PTCHD3 gene that is significantly associated with asthma (rs660498, p = 2.2 x10-7) independent of obesity status. Fewer than 5% of previously reported asthma genetic associations identified in European populations replicated in African Americans.  
Conclusions
Our identification of novel variants associated with asthma in African American children, coupled with our inability to replicate the majority of findings reported in European Americans, underscores the necessity for including diverse populations in biomedical studies of asthma.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Immunogenetics/Immunogenetics1.pdf,"[( 10 Mar 2016 , 5), ( 18 Mar 2016 , 1)]"

Recent epidemiological and population genetic data suggest that the geographic range of coccidioidomycosis is expanding as new endemic clusters have been identified in the state of Washington, well outside of the established endemic range. The genetic mechanisms and epidemiological consequences of this expansion are unknown and require better understanding of the population structure and evolutionary history of these pathogens. Here we perform whole genome SNP analyses of 64 new and 18 previously published genomes. The results provide evidence of substantial population structure in C. posadasii and demonstrate presence of distinct geographic clades in central and southern Arizona as well as dispersed populations in Texas, Mexico, South America and Central America. Although a smaller number of C. immitis strains were included in the analyses, some evidence of phylogeographic structure was also detected in this species, which has been historically limited to California and Baja Mexico.

We have previously shown that a transposon, Insertion Sequence 5 (IS5), can reversibly insert into the upstream regulatory region of the operon so as to activate glpFK and enable glycerol utilization.  GlpR, which represses glpFK transcription, binds to the glpFK upstream region near the site of IS5 insertion, and prevents insertion.  We here show that the cAMP-Crp complex, which also binds to the glpFK upstream regulatory region, also inhibits IS5 hopping into the activating site. This finding allowed us to identify conditions under which wild type cells can acquire glpFK-activating IS5 insertions. Maximal rates of IS5 insertion into the activating site require the presence of glycerol as well as a non-metabolizable sugar analogue that lowers cytoplasmic cAMP concentrations. Under these conditions, IS5 insertional mutants accumulate and outcompete the wild type cells.

Such processes are often detected using phylogenetic community structure metrics. When biologically significant elements, such as the number of species per assemblage, break down during randomizations, it can lead to high error rates. Realistic dispersal probabilities are often neglected during randomization, and existing models make the oftentimes empirically unreasonable assumption that all species are equally probable of dispersing to a given site. When this assumption is unwarranted, null models need to incorporate dispersal probabilities. I do so here, and present a dispersal null model (DNM) that strictly maintains species richness, and approximately maintains species occurrence frequencies and total abundance. I tested its statistical performance when used with a wide breadth of phylogenetic community structure metrics across 3,000 simulated communities assembled according to neutral, habitat filtering, and competitive exclusion processes. The DNM performed well, exhibiting low error rates (both type I and II). I also implemented it in a re-analysis of a large empirical dataset, an abundance matrix of 696 sites and 75 species of Australian Meliphagidae.

In silico bacterial, viral, and human truth datasets were generated to evaluate available metagenomics algorithms.  Sequenced datasets include background organisms, creating ambiguity in the true source organism for each read.  Bacterial and viral datasets were created with even and staggered coverage to evaluate organism identification, read mapping, and gene identification capabilities of available algorithms.  These truth datasets are provided as a resource for the development and refinement of metagenomic algorithms.  Algorithm performance on these truth datasets can inform decision makers on strengths and weaknesses of available algorithms and how the results may be best leveraged for bacterial and viral organism identification and characterization.

Source organisms were selected to mirror communities described in the Human Microbiome Project as well as the emerging pathogens listed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The six in silico datasets were used to evaluate the performance of six leading metagenomics algorithms: MetaScope, Kraken, LMAT, MetaPhlAn, MetaCV, and MetaPhyler.

Results
Algorithms were evaluated on runtime, true positive organisms identified to the genus and species levels, false positive organisms identified to genus and species level, read mapping, relative abundance estimation, and gene calling.  No algorithm out performed the others in all categories, and the algorithm or algorithms of choice strongly depends on analysis goals.  MetaPhlAn excels for bacteria and LMAT for viruses.  The algorithms were ranked by overall performance using a normalized weighted sum of the above metrics, and MetaScope emerged as the overall winner, followed by Kraken and LMAT.

Here we introduce a method to accurately infer heterozygosity probabilistically from very low coverage sequences of a single individual. The method relaxes the infinite sites assumption of previous methods, does not require a reference sequence and takes into account both variable sequencing errors and potential post-mortem damage. It is thus also applicable to non-model organisms and ancient genomes. Since error rates as reported by sequencing machines are generally distorted and require recalibration, we also introduce a method to infer accurately recalibration parameter in the presence of post-mortem damage. This method does also not require knowledge about the underlying genome sequence, but instead works from haploid data (e.g. from the X-chromosome from mammalian males) and integrates over the unknown genotypes. Using extensive simulations we show that a few Mb of haploid data is sufficient for accurate recalibration even at average coverages as low as 1-3x. At similar coverages, out method also produces very accurate estimates of heterozygosity down to $10^{-4}$ within windows of about 1Mb. We further illustrate the usefulness of our approach by inferring genome-wide patterns of diversity for several ancient human samples and found that 3,000-5,000 samples showed diversity patterns comparable to modern humans. In contrast, two European hunter-gatherer samples exhibited not only considerably lower levels of diversity than modern samples, but also highly distinct distributions of diversity along their genomes.

Recently, Jazayeri and Movshon reported a new and interesting perceptual illusion, demonstrating that the perceived motion direction of a dynamic random dot stimulus is systematically biased when preceded by a motion discrimination judgment. The authors hypothesized that these biases emerge because the brain predominantly relies on those neurons that are most informative for solving the discrimination task, but then is using the same neural weighting profile for generating the percept. In other words, they argue that these biases are ""mistakes"" of the brain, resulting from using inappropriate neural read-out weights. While we were able to replicate the illusion for a different visual stimulus (orientation), our new psychophysical data suggest that the above interpretation is likely incorrect: Biases are not caused by a read-out profile optimized for solving the discrimination task but rather by the specific choices subjects make in the discrimination task on any given trial. We formulate this idea as a conditioned Bayesian observer model and show that it can explain the new as well as the original psychophysical data. In this framework, the biases are not caused by mistake but rather by the brain's attempt to remain 'self-consistent' in its inference process.

However, excessive iron concentration leads to increased oxidative stress and toxicity. As such, iron homeostasis is strictly controlled by two RNA binding proteins known as Iron Regulatory Proteins (IRPs) that regulate at post-transcriptional level the expression of iron management genes. Despite this fine regulation, impairment of iron homeostasis occurs during aging:  iron progressively accumulates in several organs and in turn, it exacerbates cellular vulnerability and tissue decay. Moreover, excessive iron accumulation within the CNS is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the age-dependent changes of iron homeostasis using the short lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri. Here, we show that i) both iron content and expression of microRNA family miR-29 increase during adult life and aging in the N. furzeri brain; ii) iron up-regulates miR-29 expression in fish brain and murine neurons, while in turn miR-29 targets the 3-UTR of  IREB2  mRNA, reducing iron intake; iii) Transgenic fish with knock-down of miR-29 show significant adult-onset up-regulation of IRP2 and its target TFR1 in neurons and display enhanced age-dependent accumulation of brain iron; iv) miR-29 triggers a global gene expression response that partially overlaps with that induced by aging.

Read alignment is a critical and computationally intensive first step of most genomic data analysis pipelines. While significant effort has been dedicated to optimize the sensitivity and runtime efficiency of this step, few approaches have addressed outsourcing this computation securely to an untrusted party. The few secure solutions that have been proposed either do not scale to whole genome sequencing datasets or are not competitive with the state of the art in read mapping.

Here we characterize the functional consequences of a rare coding variant of TAO3, previously reported to significantly contribute to sporulation efficiency variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During mitosis TAO3 interacts with CBK1, a conserved NDR kinase and a component of RAM network. The RAM network genes are involved in regulation cell separation and polarization. We demonstrate that the role of the rare allele TAO3(4477C) in meiosis is distinct from its role in mitosis by being independent of ACE2, which is a RAM network target gene. By quantitatively measuring cell morphological dynamics and conditionally expressing TAO3(4477C) allele during sporulation, we show that TAO3 has an early role in meiosis. This early role of TAO3 coincides with entry of cells into meiotic division. Time-resolved transcriptome analyses during early sporulation phase identified regulators of carbon and lipid metabolic pathways as candidate mediators. We experimentally show that during sporulation the TAO3 allele genetically interacts with ERT1 and PIP2, the regulators of tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenic enzymes, respectively. We thus uncover meiotic functions of TAO3, a mitotic gene and propose ERT1 and PIP2 as novel regulators of sporulation efficiency.

Our comparative genomic analysis shows that obligatory asexual root-knot nematodes have a higher abundance of transposable elements (TE) compared to the facultative sexual and contain duplicated regions with a high within-species average nucleotide divergence of 8%. Phylogenomic analysis of the genes present in these duplicated regions suggests that they originated from multiple hybridization events. The average nucleotide divergence in the coding portions between duplicated regions is ~5-6 % and we detected diversifying selection between the corresponding gene copies. Genes under diversifying selection covered a wide spectrum of predicted functional categories which suggests a high impact of the genome structure at the functional level. Contrasting with high within-species nuclear genome divergence, mitochondrial genome divergence between the three ameiotic asexuals was very low, suggesting that these putative hybrids share a recent common maternal donor lineage.

While this assumption is acceptable for long transcript sequences, it frequently leads to large errors for short sequences, e.g., less than 100 bp.
Analysis of short sequences, such as splice junctions adjacent to alternatively spliced axons and microRNAs, is increasingly important
and necessitates addressing errors in short-sequence expression estimation. Indeed, when we examined RNA-Seq data from diverse studies, we found that large errors are introduced by variations RNA-Seq coverage due to sequence content, experimental conditions and sample preparation.
We developed a technique that we call the positional bootstrap, which quantifies the level of uncertainty in expression induced by non-uniform coverage. Unlike methods that attempt to correct for biases in coverage, but do so by making strong assumptions about the form of those biases, the positional bootstrap can quantify the noise induced by all types of bias, including unknown ones. Results obtained using independently generated RNA-Seq datasets show that the positional bootstrap increases the accuracy of estimates of alternative splicing levels, tissue-differential alternative splicing and tissue differential
expression, by a factor of up to 10.

Consequently, many inhibitors have broad selectivity profiles and most have significant off-target effects. Allosteric inhibitors are generally more selective, but are difficult to identify because allosteric binding sites are often unknown or poorly characterized, and there is no clearly preferred approach to generating hit matter. Aurora-A is activated through binding of TPX2 to an allosteric site on the kinase catalytic domain, and this knowledge could be exploited to generate an inhibitor. However, it is currently unclear how to design such a compound because a small molecule or peptide mimetic of TPX2 would be expected to activate, not inhibit the kinase. Here, we generated an allosteric inhibitor of Aurora-A kinase based on a synthetic, VNAR single domain nanobody scaffold, IgNARV-D01. Biochemical studies and a crystal structure of the Aurora-A/IgNARV-D01 complex show that the nanobody overlaps with the TPX2 binding site.

Still, the prognosis remains poor, so we need to know more about the genetic alterations in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in lung cancer, and microRNAs can regulate EGFR. So it is very important to predict the candidate microRNAs that target mutated EGFR and to investigate the role of these candidate microRNAs in lung cancer. 
Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated the difference of microRNAs expression between lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletion (H1650 and PC9) and its wild-type (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray. Then the expression of individual microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR assays. Moreover, we have detected the microRNAs expression in serum of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and wild-type. 
Results: The expression of 1,732 microRNAs was evaluated, and we found that microRNAs expression was different between these two groups. Hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-934 were up-regulated and hsa-miR-3196 was down-regulated in the EGFR exon 19 deletion group compared with wild-type group. The detection of circulating microRNAs showed that miR-3196 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion compared with wild-type. 
Conclusions: It is suggested that microRNAs associate with EGFR exon 19 deletion and miR-3196 can be further explored for potential predictor and targeted biomarker when it is difficult to get the tumors.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1324.pdf,"[( 06 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 20 Nov 2015 , 6)]"

Genome-wide association studies of statistical interactions influencing human traits have recently become computationally feasible and have identified many putative interactions. However, several factors that are difficult to address confound the statistical models used to detect interactions and make it unclear whether statistical interactions are evidence for true molecular epistasis. In this study, we investigate whether there is evidence for epistasis regulating gene expression after accounting for technical, statistical, and biological confounding factors that affect interaction studies. We identified 1,119 (FDR=5%) interactions within cis-regulatory regions that regulate gene expression in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, a tightly controlled, largely genetically determined phenotype.Approximately half of these interactions replicated in an independent dataset (363 of 803 tested). We then performed an exhaustive analysis of both known and novel confounders, including ceiling/floor effects, missing genotype combinations, haplotype effects, single variants tagged through linkage disequilibrium, and population stratification. Every replicated interaction could be explained by at least one of these confounders, and replication in independent datasets did not protect against this issue.  Assuming the confounding factors provide a more parsimonious explanation for each interaction, we find it unlikely that cis-regulatory interactions contribute strongly to human gene expression. As this calls into question the relevance of interactions for other human phenotypes, the analytic framework used here will be useful for protecting future studies of epistasis against confounding.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1325.pdf,"[( 06 Jun 2015 , 7), ( 11 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 10 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 15 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 04 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 24 Sep 2015 , 6), ( 27 Jun 2015 , 1), ( 16 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 25 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 13 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 07 Jun 2015 , 1), ( 05 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

Livestock movement tracing systems in Europe, Australia and Japan have allowed epidemiologists to model the risks engendered by transportation of live animals and prepare responses designed to protect the livestock industry. Within the US, data on livestock movement is not sufficient for direct parameterization of models for disease spread, but network models that assimilate limited data provide a path forward in model development to inform preparedness for disease outbreaks in the US. Here, we develop a novel data stream, the information publicly reported by US livestock markets on the origin of cattle consigned at live auctions, and demonstrate the potential for estimating a national-scale network model of cattle movement. By aggregating auction reports generated weekly at markets in several states, including some archived reports spanning several years, we obtain a market-oriented sample of edges from the dynamic cattle transportation network in the US. We first propose a sampling framework that allows inference about shipments originating from operations not explicitly sampled and consigned at non-reporting livestock markets in the US, and we report key predictors that are influential in extrapolating beyond our opportunistic sample. As a demonstration of the utility gained from the data and fitted parameters, we model the critical role of market biosecurity procedures in the context of a spatially homogeneous but temporally dynamic representation of cattle movements following an introduction of a foreign animal disease.

However, there is a lack of analysis methods that can integrate and interpret multiple experimental and molecular data types measured over the same set of samples.
Result: To address this challenge, we introduce moGSA, a multivariate single sample gene-set analysis method. It uses multivariate latent variable decomposition to discover correlated global variance structure across datasets and calculates an integrated gene set enrichment score using the most informative features in each data type. Integrating multiple diverse sources of data reduces the impact of missing or unreliable information in any single data type, and may increase the power to discover subtle changes in gene-sets.  We show that integrative analysis with moGSA outperforms existing single sample GSA methods on simulated data. We apply moGSA to two studies with real data. First, we discover similarities and differences in mRNA, protein and phosphorylation profiles of induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cell lines. Secondly, we report that three molecular subtypes are robustly discovered when copy number variation and mRNA profiling data of 308 bladder cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are integrated using moGSA. Our method provides positive or negative gene-set scores (with p-values) of each gene set in each sample. We demonstrate how to assess the influence of each data type or gene to a moGSA gene set score.  With moGSA, there is no requirement to filter data to the intersect of features, therefore, all molecular features on all platforms may be included in the analysis. 
Conclusion: moGSA provides a powerful yet simple tool to perform integrated simple sample gene-set analysis. Its latent variable approach is fundamentally different to existing single sample GSA approaches. It is an attractive approach for data integration and is particularly suited to integrated cluster or molecular subtype discovery.

There are a range of methods to use these IBD segments to identify relatives and estimate their relationship. These methods have focused on sharing on the autosomes, as they provide a rich source of information about genealogical relationships. We can hope to learn additional information about recent ancestry through shared IBD segments on the X chromosome, but currently lack the theoretical framework to use this information fully. Here, we fill this gap by developing probability distributions for the number and length of X chromosome segments shared IBD between an individual and an ancestor k generations back, as well as between half- and full-cousin relationships. Due to the inheritance pattern of the X and the fact that X homologous recombination only occurs in females (outside of the pseudo-autosomal regions), the number of females along a genealogical lineage is a key quantity for understanding the number and length of the IBD segments shared amongst relatives. When inferring relationships among individuals, the number of female ancestors along a genealogical lineage will often be unknown. Therefore, our IBD segment length and number distributions marginalize over this unknown number of recombinational meioses through a distribution of recombinational meioses we derive.

Sex chromosomes (especially the non-recombining and repeat-dense Y, W, U and V) are notoriously difficult to sequence. Strategies have been developed to obtain partially assembled sex chromosome sequences. However, most of them remain difficult to apply to numerous non-model organisms, either because they require a reference genome, or because they are designed for evolutionarily old systems. Sequencing a cross (parents and progeny) by RNA-seq to study the segregation of alleles and infer sex-linked genes is a cost-efficient strategy, which also provides expression level estimates. However, the lack of a proper statistical framework has limited a broader application of this approach. Tests on empirical data show that our method identifies many more sex-linked genes than existing pipelines, while making reliable inferences for downstream analyses. Simulations suggest few individuals are needed for optimal results. For species with unknown sex-determination system, the method can assess the presence and type (XY versus ZW) of sex chromosomes through a model comparison strategy. The method is particularly well optimised for sex chomosomes of young or intermediate age, which are expected in thousands of yet unstudied lineages.

Here, we consider family-biased case-control ascertainment, where cases and controls are ascertained non-randomly with respect to family relatedness.

In simulations with family-biased case-control ascertainment, LT-Fam was correctly calibrated (average χ2 = 1.00), whereas Armitage Trend Test (ATT) and standard mixed model association (MLM) were mis-calibrated (e.g. average χ2 = 0.50-0.67 for MLM).

We review the natural history of sylvatic ZIKV and present a mathematical dynamic transmission model to assess the probability of establishment of a sylvatic ZIKV transmission cycle in non-human primates and/or other mammals and arboreal mosquito vectors in Brazil. Brazil is home to multiple species of primates and mosquitoes potentially capable of ZIKV transmission, though direct assessment of host competence (ability to mount viremia sufficient to infect a feeding mosquito) and vector competence (ability to become infected with ZIKV and disseminate and transmit upon subsequent feedings) of New World species is lacking. Modeling reveals a high probability of establishment of sylvatic ZIKV across a large range of biologically plausible parameters. Probability of establishment is dependent on host population sizes and birthrates and ZIKV force of infection, but a network of as few as 6,000 primates with 10,000 mosquitoes is capable of supporting establishment of a ZIKV sylvatic cycle. Research on the susceptibility of New World monkeys or other small mammals to ZIKV, on the vector competence of New World Aedes, Sabethes, and Haemagogus mosquitoes for ZIKV, and on the geographic range of these species is urgently needed.

Since actin is required for myofibrillogenesis, it is of great interest to enhance our understanding of the spatial arrangements of palladin during sarcomeric assembly. Surprisingly, palladin was found to be discretely organized in different stages of myofibrillogenesis. Palladin revealed stress-fiber-like structures at undifferentiated stages, subsequently displayed chaotic expression and strongly co-distributed with actin, α-actinin, and myosin heavy chain of premyofibrils. At late stages, aggregates of palladin were spaced in a regular dot-like structure. On the other hand, palladin presents at I-Z-I bands of adult muscle. These observations suggest that palladin engages with sarcomeric proteins during the process of myoblast differentiation and that these interactions might occur in a temporally regulated fashion. In addition, transient overexpression of 140-kDa-palladin resulted in nonfilamentous actin arresting mature myotube formation. 200-kDa-palladin overexpression led to the early formation of Z-lines.

The CpG sites are distributed in high density clusters (or islands) separated by extended regions of low density. Cluster methylation tends to be bimodal, being dominantly unmethylated or mostly methylated. For CpG clusters near promoters, low methylation is associated with transcriptional activity, while high methylation is associated with gene silencing. Alternative CpG methylation states are thought to be stable and heritable, conferring localized epigenetic memory that allows transient signals to create long-lived gene expression states.  Positive feedback where methylated CpG sites recruit enzymes that methylate nearby CpGs, does not easily explain that as clusters increase in size or density they change from being primarily methylated to primarily unmethylated.

The balance of BCFAs and SCFAs in strains USA300 and SH1000 was affected considerably by differences in the conventional laboratory medium in which the strains were grown with media such as Mueller-Hinton broth and Luria broth resulting in high BCFAs and low SCFAs, whereas growth in Tryptic Soy Broth and Brain-Heart Infusion broth led to reduction in BCFAs and an increase in SCFAs. Straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids (SCUFAs) were not detected. However, when the organism was grown ex vivo in serum, the fatty acid composition was radically different with SCUFAs, which increase membrane fluidity, making up a substantial proportion of the total (<25%) with SCFAs (>37%)  and BCFAs (>36%)  making up the rest. Staphyloxanthin, an additional major membrane lipid component unique to S. aureus, tended to be greater in content in cells with high BCFAs or SCUFAs. Cells with high staphyloxanthin content had a lower membrane fluidity that was attributed to increased production of staphyloxanthin. S. aureus saves energy and carbon by utilizing host fatty acids for part of its total fatty acids when growing in serum.

Sterols are also recognized as the diagenetic precursors of steranes preserved in sedimentary rocks where they can function as geological proxies for eukaryotic organisms and/or aerobic metabolisms and environments. However, production of these lipids is not restricted to the eukaryotic domain as a few bacterial species also synthesize sterols. Phylogenomic studies have identified genes encoding homologs of sterol biosynthesis proteins in the genomes of several additional species, indicating that sterol production may be more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously thought. Although the occurrence of sterol synthesis genes in a genome indicates the potential for sterol production, it provides neither conclusive evidence of sterol synthesis nor information about the composition and abundance of basic and modified sterols that are actually being produced. Here, we coupled bioinformatics with lipid analyses to investigate the scope of bacterial sterol production. We identified oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc), which catalyzes the initial cyclization of oxidosqualene to the basic sterol structure, in 34 bacterial genomes from 5 phyla (Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) and in 176 metagenomes. Our data indicate that bacterial sterol synthesis likely occurs in diverse organisms and environments and also provides evidence that there are as yet uncultured groups of bacterial sterol producers.  Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and eukaryotic Osc sequences revealed two potential lineages of the sterol pathway in bacteria indicating a complex evolutionary history of sterol synthesis in this domain. We characterized the lipids produced by Osc-containing bacteria and found that we could generally predict the ability to synthesize sterols. However, predicting the final modified sterol based on our current knowledge of bacterial sterol synthesis was difficult. Some bacteria produced demethylated and saturated sterol products even though they lacked homologs of the eukaryotic proteins required for these modifications emphasizing that several aspects of bacterial sterol synthesis are still completely unknown. It is possible that bacteria have evolved distinct proteins for catalyzing sterol modifications and this could have significant implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of this ancient biosynthetic pathway.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1336.pdf,"[( 06 Apr 2016 , 5), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

However, few direct ATRX target genes have been identified and high-throughput genomic approaches are currently lacking for ATRX. Here we present a comprehensive ChIP-sequencing study of ATRX in multiple human cell lines, in which we identify the 3' exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) as a new class of ATRX targets. These 3' exonic regions encode the zinc finger motifs, which can range from 1-40 copies per ZNF gene and share large stretches of sequence similarity. These regions often contain an atypical chromatin signature: they are transcriptionally active, contain high levels of H3K36me3 and are paradoxically enriched in H3K9me3. We find that these ZNF 3' exons are co-occupied by SETDB1, TRIM28 and ZNF274, which form a complex with ATRX. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function studies demonstrate (i) a reduction of H3K9me3 at the ZNF 3' exons in the absence of ATRX and ZNF274 and, (ii) H3K9me3 levels at atypical chromatin regions are particularly sensitive to ATRX loss compared to other H3K9me3-occupied regions.

Specifically, rIFG is sensitive to the discrepancy between expectation and decision (mismatch), and, crucially, higher mismatch responses are associated with lower decision confidence. Connectivity analyses revealed the source of the expectancy information to be bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the source of sensory signals to be intracalcarine sulcus.

Linear classifiers are widely employed in the brain decoding paradigm to discriminate among experimental conditions. Then, the derived linear weights are visualized in the form of multivariate brain maps to further study the spatio-temporal patterns of underlying neural activities. It is well known that the brain maps derived from weights of linear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between predictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of multivariate brain maps. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of interpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of multivariate brain maps can be decomposed into their reproducibility and representativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed definition, we formalize a heuristic method for approximating the interpretability of multivariate brain maps in a binary magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding scenario. Third, we propose to combine the approximated interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our results for the MEG data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in  more informative multivariate brain maps.

Asia, Southeast Asia and Near Oceania. These results point to a colonization of the Indian
subcontinent by modern humans carrying M lineages from the east instead the west side.
Conclusions
The existence of a northern route previously advanced by the phylogeography of mtDNA
macrohaplogroup N is confirmed here by that of macrohaplogroup M. Taking this genetic
evidence and those reported by other disciplines we have constructed a new and more
conciliatory model to explain the history of modern humans out of Africa.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Evolutionary Biology/BMC Evolutionary Biology9.pdf,"[( 19 May 2016 , 1), ( 09 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 10 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 07 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 6), ( 06 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

Here, we explore the use of Nextera-tagmented reductively-amplified DNA (NextRAD) sequencing to infer movement of a highly-mobile winged insect, the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), among host plants. The psyllid vectors the pathogen that causes zebra chip disease in potato (Solanum tuberosum), but understanding and managing the spread of this pathogen is limited by uncertainty about the insect′s host plant(s) outside of the growing season. We identified 8,443 polymorphic loci among psyllids separated spatiotemporally on potato or in patches of bittersweet nightshade (S. dulcumara), a weedy plant proposed to be the source of potato-colonizing psyllids. A subset of the psyllids on potato exhibited close genetic similarity to insects on nightshade, consistent with regular movement between these two host plants. However, a second subset of potato-collected psyllids was genetically distinct from those collected on bittersweet nightshade; this suggests that a currently unrecognized host-plant species could be contributing to psyllid populations in potato. Oftentimes, dispersal of vectors of plant or animal pathogens must be tracked at a relatively fine scale in order to understand, predict, and manage disease spread.

We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens.

CoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species.

It uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets. 

CoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions. CoSMoMVPA also provides a generalized approach to multiple comparison correction across these dimensions using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement with state-of-the-art clustering and permutation techniques.

CoSMoMVPA is highly modular and uses abstractions to provide a uniform interface for a variety of MVP measures. Typical analyses require a few lines of code, making it accessible to beginner users. At the same time, expert programmers can easily extend its functionality.

CoSMoMVPA comes with extensive documentation, including a variety of runnable demonstration scripts and analysis exercises (with example data and solutions). It uses best software engineering practices including version control, distributed development, an automated test suite, and continuous integration testing. It can be used with the proprietary Matlab and the free GNU Octave software, and it complies with open source distribution platforms such as NeuroDebian.

Prevention of nosocomial transmission of infections is a central responsibility in the healthcare environment, and accurate identification of transmission events presents the first challenge. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequencing provides a high-resolution approach for accurately relating isolates to one another, allowing precise identification or exclusion of transmission events and sources for nearly all cases. We sequenced 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomes to retrospectively investigate a suspected point source of three surgical site infections (SSIs) that occurred over a one-year period. The source of transmission was believed to be a surgical team member colonized with MRSA, involved in all surgeries preceding the SSI cases, who was subsequently decolonized. Genetic relatedness among isolates was determined using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.

Results. Whole genome SNP typing (WGST) revealed 283 informative SNPs between the surgical team members isolate and the closest SSI isolate. The second isolate was 286 and the third was thousands of SNPs different, indicating the nasal carriage strain from the surgical team member was not the source of the SSIs. Given the mutation rates estimated for S. aureus, none of the SSI isolates share a common ancestor within the past 14 years, further discounting any common point source for these infections. The decolonization procedures and resources spent on the point source infection control could have been prevented if WGST was performed at the time of the suspected transmission, instead of retrospectively.

Conclusions. Whole genome sequence analysis is an ideal method to exclude isolates involved in transmission events and nosocomial outbreaks, and coupling this method with epidemiological data can determine if a transmission event occurred.

Predictions from these models parallel observed changes in species incidence and abundance in two distinctly different forest metacommunities and differ greatly from null model predictions.

Pelagic animals, as measured by acoustic backscatter, moved higher in the water column and decreased in abundance during spring upwelling, attributed to avoidance of a shoaling oxycline and advection offshore.  Seasonal changes were most evident in a non-migrating scattering layer near 500 m depth that disappeared in spring and reappeared in summer, building to a seasonal maximum in fall.

Similar correlations existed deeper in the water column, but at increasing lags, suggesting that near-surface productivity propagated down the water column at 10-15 m d-1, consistent with sinking speeds of marine snow measured in Monterey Bay.  Sub-seasonal variability in backscatter was best correlated with sea-surface height, suggesting that passive physical transport was most important at these time scales.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Deep-Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers /Deep-Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 1.pdf,"[( 09 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 06 May 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 12 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 20 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 27 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

It remains a major cause of infant death worldwide and is the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries. To date, most genomic studies have focused on a small subset of the BP genome, biasing our clinical understanding and public health awareness.

Methods: We performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on 76 U.S. BP whole genomes, including strains from recent outbreaks.

Results: A GWAS of the 76 BP isolates revealed a sharp increase in genetic variation associated with the Minnesota 2012 outbreak and identified 52 variants unique to the Minnesota outbreak and 19 unique to the California and Washington outbreaks. None of the identified variants were shared between the outbreaks and the vast majority were previously uncharacterized. We further identified variation associated with pertactin negative strains and acellular vaccination.

Conclusions: We identified novel genomic regions associated with recent BP outbreaks. Our results underscore the need for increased whole genome sequencing of BP isolates, which can reduce costly misdiagnosis and improve surveillance. The genes containing these variants warrant further investigation into their possible roles in BP pathogenicity and the ongoing resurgence in the U.S.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1350.pdf,"[( 10 Apr 2016 , 10), ( 09 Apr 2016 , 4), ( 11 Apr 2016 , 6)]"

S. pombe telomeres are composed of modular degenerate repeats that can be explained by variation in usage of the TER1 RNA template during reverse transcription. Taking advantage of this deep sequencing approach, we find that like repeat modules are highly correlated within individual telomeres. Moreover, repeat module preference varies with telomere length, suggesting that existing repeats promote the incorporation of like repeats and/or that specific conformations of the telomerase holoenzyme efficiently and/or processively add repeats of like nature. After the loss of telomerase activity, this sequencing and analysis pipeline defines a population of telomeres with altered sequence content.

The position of nucleosomes on DNA and the stability of the underlying histone-DNA interactions affect the access of regulatory proteins to DNA. Both stability and position are regulated through DNA sequence, histone post-translational modifications, histone variants, chromatin remodelers, and transcription factors. Here, we explored the functional implications of nucleosome properties on gene expression and development in C. elegans embryos. We performed a time-course of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, and measured the relative sensitivity or resistance of nucleosomes throughout the genome. Fragile nucleosomes were defined by nucleosomal DNA fragments recoverable preferentially in early MNase-digestion time points. We found fragile nucleosomes at locations where we expected to find destabilized nucleosomes, like transcription factor binding sites where nucleosomes compete with DNA-binding factors. Contrary to our expectation, the presence of fragile nucleosomes in gene promoters was anti-correlated with transcriptional activity. Instead, genes with fragile nucleosomes in their promoters tended to be expressed in a context-specific way, operating in neuronal response, the immune system, and stress response. Nucleosome fragility at these promoters was strongly and positively correlated with the AT content of the underlying DNA. There was not a strong correlation between promoter nucleosome fragility and the levels of histone modifications or histone variants. Our data suggest that in C. elegans promoters, nucleosome fragility is primarily a DNA-encoded feature that poises genes for future context-specific activation in response to environmental stress and developmental cues.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research36.pdf,"[( 09 Apr 2016 , 5)]"

Sugarbeet fields in four states were surveyed for K. scoparia in 2013 and tested for glyphosate-resistance level and EPSPS gene copy number. Glyphosate resistance was confirmed in K. scoparia populations collected from sugarbeet fields in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. The GR samples all had increased EPSPS gene copy number, with median population values up to 11. An empirical model was developed to estimate the level of glyphosate-resistance in K. scoparia based on EPSPS gene copy number. The results suggested that glyphosate susceptibility can be accurately diagnosed using EPSPS gene copy number, and further increases in EPSPS gene copy number could increase resistance levels up to 8-fold relative to susceptible K. scoparia. These trends suggest that continued glyphosate selection pressure is selecting for higher EPSPS copy number and higher resistance levels in K. scoparia.

We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus and devotes over 10% of its genome to a single species-specific gene family that may be mediating host interactions upon infection.

Many accounts of these biases appeal to limitations of human hypothesis testing and cognition, de facto evoking notions of bounded rationality, but neglect more basic aspects of behavioral control. Here we demonstrate involvement of Pavlovian approach biases in determining which information humans will choose to sample. We collected a large novel dataset from 32,445 human subjects, making over 3 million decisions, who played a gambling task designed to measure the latent causes and extent of information-sampling biases. We identified three novel approach-related biases, formalized by comparing subject behavior to a dynamic programming model of optimal information gathering. These biases reflected the amount of information sampled ('positive evidence approach'), the selection of which information to sample ('sampling the favorite'), and the interaction between information sampling and subsequent choices ('rejecting unsampled options'). The prevalence of all three biases was related to a Pavlovian approach-avoid parameter quantified within an entirely independent economic decision task. Our large dataset also revealed that individual differences in information seeking are a stable trait across multiple gameplays, and can be related to demographic measures including age and educational attainment. As well as revealing limitations in cognitive processing, our findings suggest information sampling biases reflect the expression of primitive, yet potentially ecologically adaptive, behavioral repertoires.

Drosophila melanogaster metamorphosis offers the opportunity to study muscle cell death in the context of development. Using live cell imaging of the abdomen, two groups of larval muscles can be observed, doomed muscles that undergo histolysis and persistent muscles that are remodelled and survive into adulthood. 
Method: To identify and characterize genes that control the decision between survival and cell death of muscles, we developed a method comprising in vivo imaging, targeted gene perturbation and time-lapse image analysis. Our approach enabled us to study the cytological and temporal aspects of abnormal cell death phenotypes.     
Results:  In a previous genetic screen for genes controlling muscle size and cell death in metamorphosis, we identified gene perturbations that induced cell death of persistent or inhibit histolysis of doomed larval muscles. RNA interference (RNAi) of the genes encoding the helicase Rm62 and the lysosomal Cathepsin-L homolog Cysteine proteinase 1 (Cp1) caused premature cell death of persistent muscle in early and mid-pupation, respectively. Silencing of the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin inhibited histolysis of doomed muscles. Overexpression of dominant-negative Target of Rapamycin (TOR) delayed the histolysis of a subset of doomed and induced ablation of all persistent muscles. RNAi of AMPKα, which encodes a subunit of the AMPK protein complex that senses AMP and promotes ATP formation, led to loss of attachment and a spherical morphology. None of the perturbations affected the survival of newly formed adult muscles, suggesting that the method is useful to find genes that are crucial for the survival of metabolically challenged muscles, like those undergoing atrophy. The ablation of persistent muscles did not affect eclosion of adult flies.  
Conclusions: 
Live imaging is a versatile approach to uncover gene functions that are required for the survival of muscle undergoing remodelling, yet are dispensable for other adult muscles.

We also compared gondal dysgenesis phenotypes and genomic P element predictions for isofemale strains obtained from three worldwide populations of D. melanogaster in order to guide further work on the molecular basis of differences in cytotype status across populations.

Previous studies have estimated the mutation rates of highly polymorphic STRs using capillary electrophoresis and pedigree-based designs. While this work has provided insights into the mutational dynamics of highly mutable STRs, the mutation rates of most others remain unknown. Here, we harnessed whole-genome sequencing data to estimate the mutation rates of Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) with 2-6 base pair repeat units that are accessible to Illumina sequencing. We genotyped 4,500 Y-STRs using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. Next, we developed MUTEA, an algorithm that infers STR mutation rates from population-scale data using a high-resolution SNP-based phylogeny. After extensive intrinsic and extrinsic validations, we harnessed MUTEA to derive mutation rate estimates for 702 polymorphic STRs by tracing each locus over 222,000 meioses, resulting in the largest collection of Y-STR mutation rates to date.

Despite extensive past research, the specific developmental mechanisms by which hermaphrodite sex allocation can evolve remain largely unknown. To address this problem, we here use experimental evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite-male populations to directly quantify changes in germline and somatic development that underlie adaptive shifts in hermaphrodite sex allocation associated with the evolution of improved self-fertility. Specifically, we test whether the evolution of hermaphrodite sex allocation is due to heterochrony, i.e. evolutionary changes in the relative timing of developmental processes.
We show that the experimental evolution of improved hermaphrodite self-fertility occurred through complex modification of a suite of developmental and reproductive traits: increased sperm production, accelerated oogenesis and ovulation rates, and increased embryo retention in utero. The experimental evolution of increased sperm production delayed entry into oogenesis - as expected, given the sequentially coupled production of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Surprisingly, however, delayed oogenesis onset did not delay reproductive maturity, nor did it trade-off with gamete or embryo size. Comparing developmental dynamics of germline and soma indicates that the evolution of increased sperm production did not delay reproductive maturity due to a globally accelerated larval development during the period of spermatogenesis. 
We conclude that the integration of multiple heterochronic events in gametogenesis and soma can explain the experimental evolution of hermaphrodite sex allocation and self-fertility. Our results thus support the idea that heterochrony can represent a specific mechanism that explains the maintenance of partial selfing in natural populations with mixed reproduction modes and different forms of hermaphroditism. More generally, our results provide a quantitative perspective on how natural selection can operate on developmental characters - and their integration - during the evolution of life history at the population level.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1358.pdf,"[( 09 Apr 2016 , 9), ( 13 Dec 2017 , 2)]"

Large-scale cancer genomics initiatives and next-generation sequencing for transcriptome profiling allow for detailed molecular characterization of tumors, and provide opportunities for clinical tools to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. Laboratory information, data management, and data sharing in large-scale genomics projects is a challenge. Aiming to introduce such technologies in a clinical setting offer additional challenges associated with requirements of short lead-times and specialized tracking of biomaterials, data, and analysis results. 

Results

Using the free open-source BioArray Software Environment (BASE) and extension package Reggie we have implemented a laboratory information management system and an automated RNAseq data analysis pipeline that successfully manage a large regional cancer genomics initiative. The system manages enrolled cancer patients, tumor biopsies, extraction of nucleic acid, and whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing through to data analysis and quality control. The implementation offers integration of laboratory equipment and operating procedures, and information tracking in a module based fashion enabling efficient and flexible use of personnel resources. The system provides two-factor authentication and transaction control and seamless integration of freely available software for RNAseq analysis such as Tophat, Cufflinks, and Picard. As of February 2016 more than 8000 patients and over 6000 tumor biopsies have been successfully processed. Lead-time from biopsy arrival to summarized reports based on RNAseq data is less than 5 days, in line with regional clinical requirements. BASE and Reggie are freely available and released as open-source under the GNU General Public License and GNU Affero General Public License, respectively.

Conclusion

Using free open-source software together with BASE and a customized extension package, Reggie, we have implemented a system capable of managing large collections of quality controlled and curated material for use in research and development and tailored to meet requirements for clinical use. Featuring high degree of automation and interactivity the system allows for resource efficient laboratory procedures and short lead-times with demonstrated use of RNAseq data analyses in a clinical setting.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1360.pdf,"[( 07 Feb 2016 , 2), ( 06 Feb 2016 , 15), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 11 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

For example, protein evolution by sequence substitution is constrained by epistasis between residues. In prokaryotes, evolutionary innovation frequently happens by macrogenomic events such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Previous work has suggested that HGT can be influenced by ancestral genomic content, yet the extent of such gene-level constraints has not yet been systematically characterized. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary impact of such constraints in prokaryotes, using probabilistic ancestral reconstructions from 634 extant prokaryotic genomes and a novel framework for detecting evolutionary constraints on HGT events. We identified 8,228 directional dependencies between genes, and demonstrated that many such dependencies reflect known functional relationships, including, for example, evolutionary dependencies of the photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO. Modeling all dependencies as a network, we adapted an approach from graph theory to establish chronological precedence in the acquisition of different genomic functions. Specifically, we demonstrated that specific functions tend to be gained sequentially, suggesting that evolution in prokaryotes is governed by functional assembly patterns. Finally, we showed that these dependencies are universal rather than clade-specific and are often sufficient for predicting whether or not a given ancestral genome will acquire specific genes. Combined, our results indicate that evolutionary innovation via HGT is profoundly constrained by epistasis and historical contingency, similar to the evolution of proteins and phenotypic characters, and suggest that the emergence of specific metabolic and pathological phenotypes in prokaryotes can be predictable from current genomes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research37.pdf,"[( 12 Apr 2016 , 2), ( 28 Sep 2015 , 8), ( 27 Sep 2015 , 2), ( 01 Oct 2015 , 1), ( 26 May 2016 , 3), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 2)]"

We use information theory to quantify the coding potential gain and show that an increase in alternative splicing probability contributes more to transcriptome expansion than exon-count.

Here we present a method that allows the rapid identification of a small number of co-regulated groups of genes - ""leading edge metagenes"" (LEMs) - from high scoring sets in GSEA results. LEM are sub-signatures which are common to multiple gene sets and that ""explain"" their enrichment specific to the experimental dataset of interest.

Further study of these biological processes over time following vaccination showed that at day 3 post-vaccination, vaccines derived from viruses or viral subunits exhibit patterns of biological processes that are distinct from protein conjugate vaccines; however, by day 7 these differences were less pronounced. This suggests that the immune response to diverse vaccines eventually converge to a common transcriptional response.

Expression patterns conserved across multiple expression datasets from independent disease studies are likely to represent important molecular events underlying the disease.

Methods: We present the INSPIRE (INferring Shared modules from multiPle gene expREssion datasets) method to infer highly coherent and robust modules of co-expressed genes and the dependencies among the modules from multiple expression datasets. Focusing on inferring modules and their dependencies conserved across multiple expression datasets is important for several reasons. First, using multiple datasets will increase the power to detect robust and relevant patterns (modules and dependencies among modules). Second, INSPIRE enables the use of multiple datasets that contain different sets of genes due to, e.g., the difference in microarray platforms. Many methods designed for expression data analysis cannot integrate multiple datasets with variable discrepancy to infer a single combined model, whereas INSPIRE can naturally model the dependencies among the modules even when a large proportion of genes are not observed on a certain platform.

Results: We evaluated INSPIRE on synthetically generated datasets with known underlying network structure among modules, and gene expression datasets from multiple ovarian cancer studies. We show that the model learned by INSPIRE can explain unseen data better and can reveal prior knowledge on gene functions more accurately than alternative methods. We demonstrate that applying INSPIRE to nine ovarian cancer datasets leads to the identification of a new marker and potential molecular driver of tumor-associated stroma - HOPX.  We also demonstrate that the HOPX module strongly overlaps with the genes defining the mesenchymal patient subtype identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer data. We provide evidence for a previously unknown molecular basis of tumor resectability efficacy involving tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells represented by HOPX.

Conclusions: INSPIRE extracts a low-dimensional description from multiple gene expression data, which consists of modules and their dependencies.

While considerably more heritability is explained by all genotyped SNPs (hg2), for most traits, much heritability remains missing (hg2 < h2). Rare variants, poorly tagged by genotyped SNPs, are a major potential source of the gap between hg2 and h2. Recent efforts to assess the contribution of both sequenced and imputed rare variants to phenotypes suggest that substantial heritability may lie in these variants. Here we analyze sequenced SNPs, imputed SNPs and haploSNPs (haplotype variants constructed from within a sample, without using a reference panel) and show that studies of heritability from these variants may be strongly confounded by subtle population stratification. For example, when meta-analyzing heritability estimates from 22 randomly ascertained case-control traits from the GERA cohort, we observe a statistically significant increase in heritability explained by imputed SNPs even after correcting for principal components (PCs) from genotyped (or imputed) SNPs.

Hyperosmotic stress induces a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in plants, and this Ca2+ response may reflect the activities of osmo-sensory components. Here, we find in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana that the rapid hyperosmotic-induced Ca2+ response exhibited enhanced response magnitudes after pre-exposure to an intermediate hyperosmotic stress. We term this phenomenon ""osmo-sensory potentiation"". The initial sensing and potentiation occurred in intact plants as well as in roots. Having established a quantitative understanding of WT responses, we investigated effects of pharmacological inhibitors and candidate channel/transporter mutants. Quintuple MSL channel mutants as well as double MCA channel mutants did not affect the response. However interestingly, double mutations in the plastid KEA transporters, kea1kea2, and a single mutation that does not visibly affect chloroplast structure, kea3, impaired the rapid hyperosmotic-induced Ca2+ responses. These mutations did not significantly affect sensory potentiation of the response. These findings suggest that plastids may play an important role in the early steps mediating the response to hyperosmotic stimuli. Together, these findings demonstrate that the plant osmo-sensory components necessary to generate rapid osmotic-induced Ca2+ responses remains responsive under varying osmolarities, endowing plants with the ability to perceive the dynamic intensities of water limitation imposed by osmotic stress.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PNAS/PNAS42.pdf,"[( 13 Apr 2016 , 4)]"

While the contribution of protein-coding and cis-regulatory mutations to adaptive traits have been well documented, additional sources of variation–such as the production of alternative RNA transcripts from a single gene, or isoforms–have been understudied. Here, we focus on the pigmentation gene Agouti, known to express multiple alternative transcripts, to investigate the role of isoform usage in the evolution of cryptic color phenotypes in deer mice (genus Peromyscus). We first characterize the Agouti isoforms expressed in the Peromyscus skin and find two novel isoforms not previously identified in Mus. Next, we show that a locally adapted light-colored population of P. maniculatus living on the Nebraska Sand Hills shows an up-regulation of a single Agouti isoform, termed 1C, compared to their ancestral dark-colored conspecifics. Using in vitro assays, we show that this preference for isoform 1C may be driven by isoform-specific differences in translation. In addition, using an admixed population of wild-caught mice, we find that variation in overall Agouti expression maps to a region near exon 1C, which also has patterns of nucleotide variation consistent with strong positive selection. Finally, we show that the independent evolution of cryptic light pigmentation in a different species, P. polionotus, has been driven by a preference for the same Agouti isoform.

It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store a patient's stool sample.

Methods: Using stool samples collected from 404 patients we tested whether the residual buffer containing resuspended feces in FIT cartridges could be used in place of intact stool samples.

Results: We found that the bacterial DNA isolated from FIT cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of patients' stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with CRC were conserved. We also found that models for detecting CRC that were generated using bacterial abundances from FIT cartridges were equally predictive as models generated using bacterial abundances from stool.

Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer from FIT cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for CRC. This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may facilitate combining FIT and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test.

Background
Poorer self-rated health (SRH) predicts worse health outcomes, even when adjusted for objective measures of disease at time of rating. Twin studies indicate SRH has a heritability of up to 60% and that its genetic architecture may overlap with that of personality and cognition. 
Methods
We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SRH on 111 749 members of the UK Biobank sample. Univariate genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)-GREML analyses were used to estimate the proportion of variance explained by all common autosomal SNPs for SRH. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) score regression and polygenic risk scoring, two complementary methods, were used to investigate pleiotropy between SRH in UK Biobank and up to 21 health-related and personality and cognitive traits from published GWAS consortia.
Results
The GWAS identified 13 independent signals associated with SRH, including several in regions previously associated with diseases or disease-related traits. The strongest signal was on chromosome 2 (rs2360675, p = 1.77x10-10) close to KLF7, which has previously been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A second strong peak was identified on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility region (rs76380179, p = 6.15x10-10). The proportion of variance in SRH that was explained by all common genetic variants was 13%. Polygenic scores for the following traits and disorders were associated with SRH: cognitive ability, education, neuroticism, BMI, longevity, ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, lung function, blood pressure, coronary artery disease, large vessel disease stroke, and type 2 diabetes. 
Conclusions
Individual differences in how people respond to a single item on SRH are partly explained by their genetic propensity to many common psychiatric and physical disorders and psychological traits.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/International Journal Of Epidemiology/International Journal Of Epidemiology2.pdf,"[( 21 Oct 2015 , 25), ( 20 Oct 2015 , 5), ( 23 Oct 2015 , 1), ( 11 Nov 2015 , 1), ( 30 Oct 2015 , 1), ( 22 Oct 2015 , 7)]"

Behavioral flexibility is one important adaptation to both patchy or edge habitats undergoing rapid environmental change. This is true in many generalist herbivores, whose diet preferences can vary substantially, both geographically and over time. Little is known about what plants allow generalist herbivores to respond to rapid environmental changes, and whether these responses are due to variability in diet preference in a population, or individual dietary flexibility. We investigated how the diet preferences of dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) might allow them to respond to drought in a spatially heterogeneous environment. We conducted cafeteria trials on woodrats during a year of extreme drought to assess individual preferences for locally available plants compared to more drought-tolerant edge vegetation. Our results show that woodrats sample a number of plants, but tend to prefer scrub oak, a dominant plant species in the available habitat, as well as chamise- a highly drought-tolerant plant predominantly present in the surrounding edge habitat.  No difference in food preferences was detected between sexes, but we found evidence for an effect based on age and proximity to edge habitat. Juveniles who lived closer to the habitat edge were more likely to consume, and consumed greater amounts of plants in cafeteria trials compared to adults and juveniles living further from the edge. In addition to oak and chamise, adults sampled large quantities of other plants such as poison oak and California buckeye, and in general included a wider array of plants in their preferred diets compared to juveniles.

In this article, we explain why this is the case. Invoking a key result from mathematical analysis in our model, namely, the inverse function theorem, we estimate the selection pressures of the mutations as a function of germline allele frequencies. Under complete dominance of oncogenic mutations, this selection function is expected to be linearly correlated with the distribution of the mutant alleles. We demonstrate that this is the case by investigating the allele frequencies of mutations in oncogenes across various cancer types, validating our model for mean effective selection. Consistent with the population genetics model of fitness, the selection function fits a gamma distribution curve that accurately describes the trend of the mutant allele frequencies. While existing equations for selection explain evolution at low allele frequencies, our equations are general formulas for natural selection under complete dominance operating at all frequencies. We show that selection exhibits linear behavior at all times, favoring dominant alleles with respect to the change in recessive allele frequency. Also, these equations show, selection behaves like power-law against the recessive alleles at low dominant allele frequency.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1368.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 3), ( 08 Apr 2016 , 3)]"

In contrast, selfing organisms are not subject to Haldane's Sieve and are more likely to fix recessive types than outcrossers, as selfing rapidly creates homozygotes, increasing overall selection acting on mutations. However, longer homozygous tracts in selfers also reduces the ability of recombination to create new genotypes. It is unclear how these two effects influence overall adaptation rates in partially selfing organisms. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles if there is an existing selective sweep in the population. We consider both the potential loss of the second beneficial mutation if it has a weaker advantage than the first, and the possible replacement of the initial allele if the second mutant is fitter. Overall, loss of weaker adaptive alleles during a first selective sweep has a larger impact on preventing fixation of both mutations in highly selfing organisms. Furthermore, the presence of linked mutations has two opposing effects on Haldane's Sieve. First, recessive mutants are disproportionally likely to be lost in outcrossers, so it is likelier that dominant mutations will fix. Second, with elevated rates of adaptive mutation, selective interference annuls the advantage in selfing organisms of not suffering from Haldane's Sieve; outcrossing organisms are more able to fix weak beneficial mutations of any dominance value.

Here, by comparing maximum likelihood estimates of selection coefficients that account for the true population size history with estimates that ignore drift, we address the following questions: how much can modeling the population size history improve estimates of selection coefficients? How much can mis-inferred population sizes hurt inferences of selection coefficients? We conduct our analysis under the discrete Wright-Fisher model by deriving the exact probability of an allele frequency trajectory in a population of time-varying size and we replicate our results under the diffusion model by extending the exact probability of a frequency trajectory derived by Steinrücken et al. (2014) to the case of a piecewise constant population. For both the discrete Wright-Fisher and diffusion models, we find that ignoring drift leads to estimates of selection coefficients that are nearly as accurate as estimates that account for the true population history, even when population sizes are small and drift is high. In populations of time-varying size, estimates of selection coefficients that ignore drift are similar in accuracy to estimates that rely on crude, yet reasonable, estimates of the population history.

It is widely accepted that movement endpoint is updated on a trial-by-trial basis with respect to the observed errors and that the motor program for a given movement follows the rules of optimal feedback control. Here, we show clear limitations of these predictions because of the existence of a switching cost for motor planning. First, this cost prevented participants from tuning their motor program appropriately for each individual trial. This was true even when the participants selected the width of the target that they reached toward or when they had learned the appropriate motor program previously. These data are compatible with the existence of a switching cost such as those found in cognitive studies. Interestingly, this cost of switching shares many features of costs reported in cognitive task switching experiments and, when tested in the same participants, was correlated with it. Second, we found that randomly changing the width of a target over the course of a reaching experiment prevents the motor system from updating the endpoint of movements on the basis of the performance on the previous trial if the width of the target has changed. These results provide new insights into the process of motor planning and how it relates to optimal control theory and to a selection by consequences process rather than to an error-based process for action selection.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Neurophysiology/Journal of Neurophysiology3.pdf,"[( 06 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 19 Sep 2016 , 1), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 13 Apr 2016 , 3)]"

Here we show that bidirectional transcription is a pervasive feature of all forms of accessible chromatin, including enhancers, promoters, CTCF-bound sites and other DNase hypersensitive regions. Transcription is less predictive for enhancer activity than epigenetic modifications such as H3K4me1 or the accessibility of DNA when measured in both enhancer assays and at endogenous loci. Bidirectional transcription initiation from accessible chromatin is therefore not sufficient for, nor specific to, enhancer activity. The stability of enhancer initiated transcripts does not influence measures of enhancer activity and we cannot detect any evidence of purifying selection on the resulting enhancer RNAs within the human population.  Our results suggest that transcription initiating at enhancers is frequently a by-product of promiscuous RNA polymerase activity at accessible chromatin, and may not generally play a functional role in enhancer activity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Biology/Genome Biology48.pdf,"[( 10 May 2016 , 4), ( 18 Apr 2016 , 4), ( 24 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 15 Apr 2016 , 10), ( 25 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 21 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 30 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 17 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 14 May 2016 , 1), ( 27 May 2016 , 1), ( 25 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 48), ( 19 Apr 2016 , 2), ( 16 Apr 2016 , 8)]"

Recently proposed models suggest that long-range force transmission can be attributed to the nonlinear elasticity or fibrous nature of collagen matrices, yet the mechanism whereby fibers align remains unknown. Moreover, cell shape and anisotropy of cellular contraction are not considered in existing models, although recent experiments have shown that they play crucial roles. Here, we explore all of the key factors that influence long-range force transmission in cell-populated collagen matrices: alignment of collagen fibers, responses to applied force, strain stiffening properties of the aligned fibers, aspect ratios of the cells, and the polarization of cellular contraction. A constitutive law accounting for mechanically-driven collagen fiber reorientation is proposed. We systematically investigate the range of collagen fiber alignment using both finite element simulations and analytical calculations. Our results show that tension-driven collagen fiber alignment plays a crucial role in force transmission. Small critical stretch for fiber alignment, large fiber stiffness and fiber strain-hardening behavior enable long-range interaction. Furthermore, the range of collagen fiber alignment for elliptical cells with polarized contraction is much larger than that for spherical cells with diagonal contraction.  A phase diagram showing the range of force transmission as a function of cell shape and polarization and matrix properties is presented. Our results are in good agreement with recent experiments, and highlight the factors that influence long-range force transmission, in particular tension-driven alignment of fibers.

However, good platforms for sharing habitat information for threatened ecosystems are still lacking. Limestone hills are an example of threatened ecosystems that harbour unique biodiversity, but are facing intensifying anthropogenic disturbances. As limestone is a vital resource for the construction industry, it is not possible to completely halt forest degradation and quarrying in developing countries such as Malaysia, where 445 limestone hills have been recorded in the peninsula to date. As such, there is an urgent need to identify which hills must be prioritised for conservation.

To assist in conservation prioritisation efforts, we quantify characteristics of limestone hills in terms of size, degree of isolation, and spatial distribution patterns and also assessed the degree of habitat disturbance of each limestone hill in terms of buffer area forest degradation and quarrying activity. All this information is stored in a KMZ file and can be accessed through the Google Earth interface. This product should not be viewed as a final output containing basic limestone hill information.

We first estimate genome sizes or use published values for four hermaphrodites and four dioecious species distributed across the phylogeny and show that dioecious species typically have larger genomes than hermaphroditic species.

Arabidopsis pedemontana and Arabidopsis cebennensis, two endemic species from Italy and France respectively, provide an excellent model to study the adaptive potential of species with small distribution ranges. To evaluate the genome-wide levels and patterns of genetic variation, effective population size and demographic history of both species, we genotyped 53 A. pedemontana and 28 A. cebennensis individuals across the entire species ranges with Genotyping-by-Sequencing. SNPs data confirmed a low genetic diversity for A. pedemontana although its effective population size is relatively high.

Despite this and a larger distribution, the overall genetic diversity was even lower for A. cebennensis than for A. pedemontana.

When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. The main view stipulates that spikes initiate in a conventional manner at the distal end of the AIS, then progressively sharpen as they backpropagate to the soma. We examined the biophysical models used to substantiate this view, and we found that orthodromic spikes do no initiate through a local axonal current loop that propagates along the axon, but through a global current loop encompassing the AIS and soma, which forms an electrical dipole. Therefore, the phenomenon is not adequately modeled as the backpropagation of an electrical wave along the axon, since the wavelength would be as large as the entire system. Instead, in these models, we found that spike initiation rather follows the critical resistive coupling model proposed recently, where the Na current entering the AIS is matched by the axial resistive current flowing to the soma. Besides demonstrating it by examining the balance of currents at spike initiation, we show that the observed increase in spike sharpness along the axon is artifactual and disappears when an appropriate measure of rapidness is used; instead, somatic onset rapidness can be predicted from spike shape at initiation site. Finally, we reproduce the phenomenon in a two-compartment model, showing that it does not rely on propagation. In these models, the sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of observing spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spikes are initiated through a global soma-AIS current loop forming an electrical dipole.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE126.pdf,"[( 18 Apr 2016 , 2), ( 23 Jan 2016 , 1), ( 08 Feb 2017 , 1), ( 22 Jan 2016 , 4), ( 07 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 10 Feb 2017 , 1)]"

Usually all ratio combinations are selected for association tests. However, with more metabolites being detectable, the quadratic increase of the ratio number becomes challenging from a statistical, computational and interpretational point-of-view. Therefore methods which select biologically meaningful ratios are required.
We here present a network-based approach by selecting only closely connected metabolites in a given metabolic network. The feasibility of this approach was tested on in silico data derived from simulated reaction networks. Especially for small effect sizes, network-based metabolite ratios (NBRs) improved the metabolite-based prediction accuracy of genetically-influenced reactions compared to the 'all ratios' approach. Evaluating the NBR approach on published GWAS association results, we compared reported 'all ratio'-SNP hits with results obtained by selecting only NBRs as candidates for association tests. Input networks for NBR selection were derived from public pathway databases or reconstructed from metabolomics data. NBR-candidates covered more than 80% of all significant ratio-SNP associations and we could replicate 7 out of 10 new associations predicted by the NBR approach.
In this study we evaluated a network-based approach to select biologically meaningful metabolite ratios as quantitative traits in GWAS. Taking metabolic network information into account facilitated the analysis and the biochemical interpretation of metabolite-gene association results. For upcoming studies, for instance with case-control design, large-scale metabolomics data and small sample numbers, the analysis of all possible metabolite ratios is not feasible due to the correction for multiple testing.

This problem is important in genomics, for example, where it is often desired to estimate variances for thousands of genes (or some other genomic unit) from just a few measurements on each. A common approach to this problem is to use an Empirical Bayes (EB) method that assumes the variances among genes follow an inverse-gamma distribution. Here we describe a more flexible EB method, whose main assumption is that the distribution of the variances (or, as an alternative, the precisions) is unimodal. We show that this more flexible assumption provides competitive performance with existing methods when the variances truly come from an inverse-gamma distribution, and can outperform them when the distribution of the variances is more complex. In analyses of several human gene expression datasets from the Genotype Tissues Expression (GTEx) consortium, we find that our more flexible model often fits the data appreciably better than the single inverse gamma distribution. At the same time we find that, for variance estimation, the differences between methods is often small, suggesting that the simpler methods will often suffice in practice.

Since its emergence in 2007 in Micronesia and Polynesia, the arthropod-borne flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread in the Americas and the Caribbean, following first detection in Brazil in May 2015. The risk of ZIKV emergence in Europe increases as imported cases are repeatedly reported. Together with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Any countries where these mosquitoes are present could be potential sites for future ZIKV outbreak.
Methodology/Principal Findings:
Mosquito females were challenged with an Asian genotype of ZIKV. Fully engorged mosquitoes were then maintained in insectary conditions . 16-24 mosquitoes from each population were examined at 3, 6, 9 and 14 days post-infection to estimate the infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Based on these experimental infections, we demonstrated that Ae. albopictus from France were not very susceptible to ZIKV.
Conclusions/Significance:
In combination with the restricted distribution and lower population densities of European Ae. albopictus, our results corroborate the low risk for ZIKV to expand into most parts of Europe with the possible exception of the warmest regions bordering the Mediterranean coastline.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases/PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases10.pdf,"[( 25 Apr 2016 , 2), ( 14 Apr 2016 , 5), ( 25 Jul 2017 , 1), ( 16 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 2)]"

Here we consider the alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not.

This seems counter to the theory that the fraction of life spent reproducing should be maximized in order to maximize the number of offspring produced in each generation. To resolve this paradox, hypotheses have been developed that evoke parental or grandparental care as reasons for post-reproductive life (e.g., the Mother and Grandmother Hypotheses). However, these hypotheses fail to explain the presence of post-reproductive life in organisms that do not care for their young, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that a candidate proxy of the stress of childbirth explains a large portion of the variance in post-reproductive lifespans across many species. A remarkably simple metric, the offspring ratio (ratio of the size or weight of offspring to that of the mother) explained 77% of the variance of the post-reproductive lifespan in a sample drawn from widely dispersed taxa. Our results suggest that the stress of childbirth is an important and conserved determinant of post-reproductive lifespan.

Motivation: Predict whether a mutation is deleterious based on the custom 3D model of a protein.
Methods: We have developed modict, a mutation prediction tool which is based on per residue rmsd (root mean square deviation) values of superimposed 3D protein models.

Moreover, modict scores corresponded to experimentally verified residual enzyme activities in mutated biotinidase, phenylalanine hydroxylase and medium chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Several commercially available prediction algorithms were tested and results were
compared. The modict perl package and the manual can be downloaded from

Using proTGFα, the transmembrane precursor of transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), as a model cargo protein, we demonstrate in cell-free assays that at least one auxiliary cytosolic factor is specifically required for the efficient packaging of proTGFα into COPII vesicles. Using a knockout HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we provide functional evidence showing that a transmembrane protein, Cornichon-1 (CNIH), acts as a cargo receptor of proTGFα. We show that both CNIH and the auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) are required for efficient recruitment of proTGFα to the COPII coat in vitro.

In insects and crustaceans, Argonaute-2 silences viral nucleic acids, and therefore acts as a primary effector of innate antiviral immunity. Although the function of the major Argonaute-2 domains, which are conserved across most Argonaute-family proteins, are known, many invertebrate Argonaute-2 homologs contain a glutamine-rich repeat (GRR) region of unknown function at the N-terminus. Here we combine long-read amplicon sequencing of Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines with publicly available sequence data from many insect species to show that this region evolves extremely rapidly and is hypervariable within species. We identify distinct GRR haplotype groups in D. melanogaster, and suggest that one of these haplotype groups has recently risen to high frequency in North American populations. Finally, we use published data from genome-wide association studies of viral resistance in D. melanogaster to test whether GRR haplotypes are associated with survival after virus challenge. We find a marginally significant association with survival after challenge with Drosophila C Virus in the DGRP, but we were unable to replicate this finding using lines from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource panel.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics/G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics49.pdf,"[( 14 Apr 2016 , 8)]"

their initial radiation about 540Mya they have evolved a plethora of traits and body forms allowing them
to conquer almost any habitat on earth. There are only few truly uniting and shared morphological
features retained across the phylum. Unsurprisingly, also the genetic toolkit of bilateria is highly diverged. In the light of this divergence we investigated if a set of bilaterian-specific genes exists and, beyond this, if such genes are related with respect to function and expression patterns among organisms as distant as Drosophila, Caenorhabditis and Danio. Using a conservative pyramidal approach of orthology inference we collected a set of protein-coding genes which have orthologs in all major branches of Bilateria, but no homologs in non-bilaterian species. To characterize the proteins with respect to function, we employ a novel method for multi-species GO analysis and augmented it by a human-curated annotation based on an extensive literature search. Finally, we extracted characteristic developmental expression profiles for Bilateria from the extensive data available for three model organisms and we explored the relation between expression and function. Among an initial set of several hundred candidates we identified 85 clusters of orthologous proteins which passed our filter criteria for bilaterian specificity. Although some of these proteins belong to common developmental processes, they cover a wide range of biological components, from transcription factors to metabolic enzymes. For instance, the clusters include myoD, an important regulator of mesodermal cell fate and muscle development, and prospero and several other factors involved in nervous system development. Our results reveal a so far unknown connection between morphological key innovations of bilateria, such as the mesoderm and a complex nervous system, and their genetic basis. Furthermore, we find typical expression profiles for these bilaterian specific genes, with the majority of them being highly expressed when the adult body plan is constructed. These observations are compatible with the idea that bilaterians are characterized by the unfolding of a new developmental phase, namely the transition of the larva to morphologically distinct adults.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1383.pdf,"[( 20 Mar 2016 , 8), ( 21 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 19 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

The neuronal mechanisms underlying the generation of brain rhythms are poorly understood, particularly for low-frequency oscillations. We recently reported that respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity causes delta band (0.5 - 4 Hz) oscillatory neuronal activity in the whisker sensory (barrel) cortex in mice. Furthermore, gamma oscillations (30 - 100Hz), which are widely implicated in cognitive processing, were power-modulated in synchrony with the respiratory rhythm. These findings link afferent sensory activity caused by respiration directly to cortical rhythms associated with cognitive functions. Here we review the related literature and present new evidence to propose that respiration has a direct influence on oscillatory cortical activity, including gamma oscillations, and on transitions between synchronous and asynchronous cortical network states (marked by phase transitions). Oscillatory cortical activity, as well as phase transitions, has been implicated in cognitive functions, potentially linking respiratory phase to cognitive processing. We further argue that respiratory influence on cortical activity is present in most, and possibly in all areas of the neocortex in mice and humans. We furthermore suggest that respiration had a role in modulating cortical rhythms from early mammalian evolution. Early mammals relied strongly on their olfactory sense and had proportionately large olfactory bulbs. We propose that to this day the respiratory rhythm remains an integral element of dynamic cortical activity in mammals. We argue that breathing modulates all cortical functions, including cognitive and emotional processes, which could elucidate the well-documented but largely unexplained effects of respiratory exercises on mood and cognitive function.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1385.pdf,"[( 17 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 04 May 2016 , 2), ( 21 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 19 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 16 Apr 2016 , 6)]"

We used retro-orbital dye fills, in combination with fluorescent markers for motoneuron location and birthdate, to probe spatial and temporal organization of the oculomotor (nIII) and trochlear (nIV) nuclei in the larval zebrafish.

Dorsal nIII motoneurons are, moreover, born before motoneurons of ventral nIII and nIV.

We examined associations of birth weight with a comprehensive metabolic profile measured in adolescents and adults.
Methods: High-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays were used to quantify 87 circulating metabolic measures in seven cohorts from Finland and the United Kingdom comprising altogether 18 288 individuals (mean age 26 years, range 15-75). Metabolic associations with birth weight were assessed by linear regression models adjusted for sex, gestational age, and age at blood sampling. The metabolic associations with birth weight were compared to the corresponding associations with adult body mass index (BMI).
Results: Lower birth weight was adversely associated with cardiometabolic biomarkers, including lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, amino acids, and markers of inflammation and impaired liver function (P<0.0015 for 46 measures). Associations were consistent across cohorts with different ages at metabolic profiling, but the magnitudes were weak. The pattern of metabolic deviations associated with lower birth weight resembled the metabolic signature of higher adult BMI (R2=0.77). The resemblance indicated that 1-kg lower birth weight is associated with similar metabolic aberrations as caused by 0.92-units higher BMI in adulthood.
Conclusion: Lower birth weight is associated with adverse biomarker aberrations across multiple metabolic pathways.

Methods: This study examines longitudinal metagenomics data modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given an external perturbation, the MDP predicts the next microbiome state in a temporal sequence, selected from a finite set of possible microbiome states.

Results: We examined three distinct datasets to demonstrate this approach.  An MDP created for a vaginal microbiome time series generates a variety of behaviour policies.  For example, that moving from a state associated with bacterial vaginosis to a healthier one, requires avoiding perturbations such as lubricant, sex toys, tampons and anal sex. The flexibility of our proposal is verified after applying MDPs to human gut and chick gut microbiomes, taking nutritional intakes, or salmonella and probiotic treatments, respectively, as perturbations. In the latter case, MDPs provided a quantitative explanation for why salmonella vaccine accelerates microbiome maturation in chicks. This novel analytical approach has applications in, for example, medicine where the MDP could suggest the sequence of perturbations (e.g. clinical interventions) to apply to follow the best path from any given starting state, to a desired (healthy) state, avoiding strongly negative states.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1390.pdf,"[( 21 Apr 2016 , 8), ( 08 Oct 2017 , 2), ( 23 Apr 2016 , 3)]"

The stochasticity of localized weather, however, has traditionally been viewed as impeding the quantitative study of such risks. In March 2015 a severe weather outbreak along the Arkansas River near Tulsa, Oklahoma caused widespread damage among a highly-concentrated and long-monitored population of nesting Bald Eagles. We conducted field surveys on the extent of nest loss and consulted weather and observer records to determine what characteristics of the storm (maximum azimuthal wind shear) or nests (years of use) might have been associated with nest destruction. We found 5 of 9 nests along a ~24km stretch of the river were destroyed during the storm, causing the death of at least 8 eaglets. Mean years of use was higher among destroyed nests (4.8) than surviving nests (4.0), though not significantly so within this limited sample. The degree of maximum azimuthal shear (i.e., wind rotation) during the storm within 800m of the nests, however, did significantly differ both in terms of maximums (15.8 vs 9.5 ms-1) and means (9.4 vs 6.6 ms-1) for destroyed versus persisting nests, respectively.

Here, using microbial experiments and simulations, we show that, starting with standing adaptive variation, range expansions generate a larger increase in mean fitness than spatially uniform population expansions. The adaptation gain results from 'soft' selective sweeps emerging from surfing beneficial mutations.

Recent reports show that M1 beta-high gamma (50-200 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is exaggerated in PD and is reduced following acute deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here we analyze invasive M1 electrocorticography recordings in PD patients on and off DBS, and in isolated cervical dystonia patients, and show that M1 beta oscillations are nonsinusoidal, having sharp and asymmetric features. These sharp oscillatory beta features underlie the previously reported PAC, providing an alternative to the standard interpretation of PAC as an interaction between two distinct frequency components. Specifically, the ratio between peak and trough sharpness is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma PAC (r = 0.96) and predicts PD-related motor deficit. Using a simulation of the local field potential, we demonstrate that sharp oscillatory waves can arise from synchronous synaptic activity. We propose that exaggerated beta-high gamma PAC may actually reflect such synchronous synaptic activity, manifesting as sharp beta oscillations that are ""smoothed out"" with DBS. These results support the ""desynchronization"" hypothesis of DBS wherein DBS counteracts pathological synchronization throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. We argue that PAC can be influenced by more than one mechanism. In this case synaptic synchrony, rather than the often assumed spike-field coherence, may underlie exaggerated PAC.

Application of the theory, which reproduces the previously proven scaling of the lower bound for noise suppression in terms of the number of signaling events, shows that a tetracycline repressor-based negative-regulatory gene circuit behaves as a WK filter.

In a vast majority of sexual eukaryotes, mitochondria are inherited uniparentally from only one of the two mating types, which is thought to facilitate purifying selection against deleterious mitochondrial mutations and limit the inter-genomic conflicts. Here I argue that two mating types in eukaryotes represent a mechanism of mitochondrial quality control through the highly asymmetric transmission of mitochondrial genes at cell fusion. I develop a mathematical model to explicitly study the evolution of two self-incompatible mating type alleles linked to the nuclear locus controlling the pattern of organelle inheritance. The invasion of mating-type alleles is opposed by the short-term fitness benefit of mitochondrial mixing under negative epistasis and the lower chance of encountering a compatible mating partner. Nevertheless, under high mitochondrial mutation rates purifying selection against defective mitochondria can drive two mating types with uniparental inheritance to fixation. The invasion is further facilitated by the paternal leakage of mitochondria under paternal control of cytoplasmic inheritance. In contrast to previous studies, the model does not rely on the presence of selfish cytoplasmic elements, providing a more universal solution to the long-standing evolutionary puzzle of two sexes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1396.pdf,"[( 21 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

Videos are difficult to produce and edit, particularly due to the non-linear nature of the exploratory process. Most importantly, however, neither approach provides the opportunity to return to any point in the exploration in order to review the state of the visualization in detail or to conduct additional analyses.

We discuss how the CLUE approach can be integrated into visualization tools and provide a prototype implementation.

Results: We propose a computational framework and sequence resource for assessing completeness of fungal genomes called FGMP (Fungal Genome Mapping Project). Our approach is based on evolutionary conserved sets of proteins and ultra conserved DNA elements and is applicable to various types of genomic data.

The recent emergence of population-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets has enabled genome-wide CNV delineation. However, molecular validation at this scale is impractical, so visualization is an invaluable preliminary screening approach when evaluating CNVs.  Standardized tools for visualization of CNVs in large WGS datasets are therefore in wide demand. 
Methods & Results: To address this demand, we developed a software tool, CNView, for normalized visualization, statistical scoring, and annotation of CNVs from population-scale WGS datasets. CNView surmounts challenges of sequencing depth variability between individual libraries by locally adapting to cohort-wide variance in sequencing uniformity at any locus. Importantly, CNView is broadly extensible to any reference genome assembly and most current WGS data types.

The requirement for co-transplantation of two adult progenitor cells is one factor that can potentially complicate the process of therapeutic vasculogenesis which hampers the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention referred to as regenerative medicine. Here we employed a novel strategy for therapeutic vessel development by transplanting endothelial colony forming progenitor cells solely to immune compromised mice and detect vessel formation capacity of single ECFC transplants compared to ECFC/MSPC co-transplants. We applied umbilical cord derived and bone marrow derived-MSPC and umbilical cord derived ECFC with different total cell number for subcutaneous transplantation in matrix composites either alone or mixed at a ratio of 1:5 subcutaneously into immune deficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; NSG mice.

Results confirmed that single transplantation of ECFCs with a higher cell number and later in the time course after transplantation is as efficient as co-transplantation of ECFC with MSPC at forming stable-perfused human vessels. Amongst ECFCs isolated from different human sources, white adipose tissue derived ECFC are most potent in forming neo-vessels (micro-vessels) in vivo, thus WAT-ECFC could be an optimal cell for vasculogenesis regenerative application.

Results showed that ECFC and MSC possess variable capacity in contributing to neo-vasculogenesis.

By ignoring genes with variable within-group expression, an important axis of genetic heterogeneity contributing to expression variability among affected individuals has been overlooked. To this end, we develop a new gene expression analysis method--aberrant gene expression analysis, based on the multivariate distance commonly used for outlier detection. Our method detects the discrepancies in gene expression dispersion between groups and identifies genes with significantly different expression variability. Using this new method, we re-visited RNA sequencing data generated from post-mortem brain tissues of 47 ASD and 57 control samples. We identified 54 functional gene sets whose expression dispersion in ASD samples is more pronounced than that in controls, as well as 76 co-expression modules present in controls but absent in ASD samples due to ASD-specific aberrant gene expression.

With a whole blood expression data set, we identified three aberrantly expressed gene sets whose expression levels serve as discriminating variables achieving >70% classification accuracy.

I show that the orthodox estimators suffer from pathologies such as predicting negative values for a manifestly non-negative quantity, i.e. variance, and show that the Bayesian estimators do not suffer from such pathologies. In addition, I show that the Bayesian analysis automatically identifies that optimal estimates of intrinsic and extrinsic noise depend on a subtle combination of two statistics of the data, allowing for accuracies that are up to twice the accuracy of the orthodox estimators in some parameter regimes.

Recently, existing health and social science cohorts have begun to collect genomic data. Causes of selection into a genomic dataset can influence results from genomic analyses. Selective non-participation, which is specific to a particular study and its participants, has received attention in the literature.  But mortality selection---the very general phenomenon that genomic data collected at a particular age represents selective participation by only the subset of birth cohort members who have survived to the time of data collection---has been largely ignored. Here we test the hypothesis that such mortality selection may significantly alter estimates in polygenic association studies of both health and non-health traits. We demonstrate mortality selection into genome-wide SNP data collection at older ages using the U.S.-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We then model the selection process. Finally, we test whether mortality selection alters estimates from genetic association studies. We find evidence for mortality selection. Healthier and more socioeconomically advantaged individuals are more likely to survive to be eligible to participate in the genetic sample of the HRS. Mortality selection leads to modest drift in estimating time-varying genetic effects, a drift that is enhanced when estimates are produced from data that has additional mortality selection. There is no general solution for correcting for mortality selection in a birth cohort prior to entry into a longitudinal study. We illustrate how genetic association studies using HRS data can adjust for mortality selection from study entry to time of genetic data collection by including probability weights that account for mortality selection.

Computational prediction of kinase targets -- assigning kinases to putative substrates, and selecting from protein sequence the sites that kinases can phosphorylate -- requires the consideration of both the cellular context that kinases operate in, as well as their binding affinity. This consideration enables investigation of how phosphorylation influences a range of biological processes.

We report here a novel probabilistic model for the classification of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from sequence across three model organisms: human, mouse and yeast. The model incorporates position-specific amino acid frequencies, and counts of co-occurring amino acids from kinase binding sites in a kinase- and family-specific manner. We show how this model can be seamlessly integrated with protein interactions and cell-cycle abundance profiles. When evaluating the prediction accuracy of our method, PhosphoPICK, on an independent hold-out set of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, we found it achieved an average specificity of 97% while correctly predicting 32% of true positives. We also compared PhosphoPICK's ability, through cross-validation, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with alternative methods, and found that at high levels of specificity PhosphoPICK outperforms alternative methods for most comparisons made.

We investigated the relationship between experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites and predicted nuclear localisation signals by predicting the most likely kinases to be regulating the phosphorylated residues immediately upstream or downstream from the localisation signal.

While selection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size decreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological populations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small and large---but not intermediate-sized---populations are favored to evolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology61.pdf,"[( 22 Apr 2016 , 5), ( 04 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 23 Apr 2016 , 3)]"

While modifications to DNA and histone proteins have been implicated as likely candidates for generating and regulating phenotypic plasticity, specific details of each modification and its mode of operation have remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how epigenetic mechanisms affect phenotypic plasticity in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. By measuring reaction norms of strains that are deficient in one of several key physiological processes we show that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in homeostasis and phenotypic plasticity of the fungus across a range of controlled environments. Effects on plasticity are specific to an environment and mechanism, indicating that epigenetic regulation is context dependent and is not governed by general plasticity genes.

Using genome-wide RAD markers, we describe the structure of the genetic diversity and the demographic dynamics of the H. cristata invasive populations and compare their genetic diversity with that of native African populations of both H. cristata and its sister species, H. africaeaustralis. First, we demonstrate that genetic diversity is lower in both the invasive Italian and the North Africa source range relative to other native populations from Sub-Saharan and South Africa. Second, we find evidence of multiple introduction events in the invasive range followed by very limited gene flow. Through coalescence-based demographic reconstructions, we also show that the bottleneck at introduction was mild and did not affect the introduced genetic diversity. Finally, we reveal that the current spatial expansion at the northern boundary of the range is following a leading-edge model characterized by a general reduction of genetic diversity towards the edge of the expanding range.

The study of the lag phase and the estimation of its critical timescale provide insight into the factors regulating the fibrillation process. However, methods to estimate a quantitative expression for the lag time rely on empirical expressions, which cannot connect the lag time to kinetic parameters associated with the reaction mechanisms of protein fibrillation. Here we introduce an approach for the estimation of the lag time using the governing rate equations of the elementary reactions of a subsequent monomer addition model for protein fibrillation as a case study. We show that the lag time is given by the sum of the critical timescales for each fibril intermediate in the subsequent monomer addition mechanism and therefore reveals causal connectivity between intermediate species.

Recently, we showed that antibiotic degrading species dramatically alter community dynamics: replacing intrinsic resistance with resistance through degradation generates stable communities resilient to spatial mixing, large species abundance perturbations, changes in interaction strengths, and differences in species growth rates. In addition to ecological stability, it is interesting to consider evolutionary stability of these communities to the appearance of cheater species that either cease production or degradation of antibiotics. Our investigation of evolutionary stability of cyclical 3-species communities revealed that these communities are robust to cheaters that stop degrading antibiotics. Our simulations also showed that cheaters that stop producing antibiotics do not take over the community, yet they can transiently invade and cause community collapse. In the analytical approximation we initially investigated, production cheaters with a small fitness advantage can invade the community simply because the benefit of inhibiting competitors is shared among all cells. Here, we consider evolutionary stability to cheaters in our complete model, where spatial mixing is introduced only after a short range colonization step. In this regime, an antibiotic producer cell directly benefits from killing nearby competitor species as it has a greater chance of colonizing the newly voided spaces created by the action of its antibiotic. Simulating response to cheater invasions for the cyclical three species community and for random 4-species ecologically stable topologies, we find that these communities can be fully resilient to both degradation and production cheaters. The strength of selection against cheaters varies with the area of the zone of inhibition around producers and is maximized for weak inhibition, where there is less overlap between the killing zones of neighboring cells. These results may aid the construction of complex synthetic communities that are both ecological and evolutionary stable.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1413.pdf,"[( 31 Mar 2016 , 8), ( 04 May 2016 , 2), ( 24 Apr 2016 , 2)]"

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus in the same genus as dengue virus and yellow fever virus. ZIKV transmission was first detected in Colombia in September 2015. The virus has spread rapidly across the country in areas infested with the vector Aedes aegypti. As of March 2016, Colombia has reported over 50,000 cases of Zika virus disease (ZVD).
Methods:
We analyzed surveillance data of ZVD cases reported to the local health authorities of San Andres, Colombia, and Girardot, Colombia, between September 2015 and January 2016. Standardized case definitions used in both areas were determined by the Ministry of Health and Colombian National Institute of Health at the beginning of the ZIKV epidemic. ZVD was laboratory- confirmed by a finding of Zika virus RNA in the serum of acute cases. We report epidemiological summaries of the two outbreaks. We also use daily incidence data to estimate the basic reproductive number R0 in each population.
Findings:
We identified 928 and 1,936 laboratory or clinically confirmed cases in San Andres and Girardot, respectively. The overall attack rate for reported ZVD detected by healthcare local surveillance was 12.13 cases per 1,000 residents of San Andres and 18.43 cases per 1,000 residents of Girardot. Attack rates were significantly higher in females in both municipalities. Cases occurred in all age groups but the most affected group was 20 to 49 year olds. The estimated R0 for the Zika outbreak in San Andres was 1.41 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.74), and in Girardot was 4.61 (95% CI 4.11 to 5.16).
Interpretation:
Transmission of ZIKV is ongoing and spreading throughout the Americas rapidly. The observed rapid spread is supported by the relatively high basic reproductive numbers calculated from these two outbreaks in Colombia.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Eurosurveillance/Eurosurveillance1.pdf,"[( 25 Apr 2016 , 3), ( 28 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 24 Apr 2016 , 9), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 1)]"

In seeking to disrupt Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) in a Thy1-YFP transgenic mouse, we assessed the feasibility of utilising the adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) to deliver CRISPR/Cas for genome modification of retinal cells in vivo.
 
METHODS: sgRNA plasmids were designed to target YFP and after in vitro validation, selected guides were cloned into a dual AAV system. One AAV2 construct was used to deliver SpCas9 and the other delivered sgRNA against YFP or LacZ (control) in the presence of mCherry. Five weeks after intravitreal injection, retinal function was determined using electroretinography and CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene modifications were quantified in retinal flat mounts. 

RESULTS: AAV2-mediated in vivo delivery of SpCas9 with sgRNA targeting YFP, significantly reduced the number of YFP fluorescent cells of the inner retina of our transgenic mouse model. Overall, we found an 84.0% (95% CI: 81.8-86.9) reduction of YFP-positive cells in YFP-sgRNA infected retinal cells compared to eyes treated with LacZ-sgRNA. Electroretinography profiling found no significant alteration in retinal function following AAV2-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas components compared to contralateral untreated eyes.

CONCLUSIONS: Thy1-YFP transgenic mice were used as a rapid quantifiable means to assess the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas-based retinal gene modification in vivo.

Type II diabetic subjects (mean age: 46/60 men/women) with normal AER [<2.26 mg/mmole (20 micrograms/mg) creatinine] and free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) were studied.

Understanding the relationship between a stimulus and how it is perceived reveals fundamental principles about the mechanisms of sensory perception. While this stimulus-percept problem is mostly understood for color vision and tone perception, it is not currently possible to predict how a given molecule smells. While there has been some progress in predicting the pleasantness and intensity of an odor, perceptual data for a larger number of diverse molecules are needed to improve current predictions. Towards this goal, we tested the olfactory perception of 480 structurally and perceptually diverse molecules at two concentrations using a panel of 55 healthy human subjects.

Results
For each stimulus, we collected data on perceived intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity. In addition, subjects were asked to apply 20 semantic odor quality descriptors to these stimuli, and were offered the option to describe the smell in their own words. Using this dataset, we replicated several previous correlations between molecular features of the stimulus and olfactory perception. The number of sulfur atoms in a molecule was highly correlated with the descriptors garlic, fish, decayed, and large and structurally complex molecules were perceived to be more pleasant. We discovered a number of strong correlations in intensity perception between molecules, which suggests a shared mechanism for perceiving these molecules. We show that familiarity had a strong effect on the ability of subjects to describe a smell. Many subjects used commercial products to describe familiar odors, highlighting the role of prior experience in biasing verbal report of perceived smells. Nonspecific descriptors like chemical were applied frequently to unfamiliar smells, and unfamiliar odors were generally rated as neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 

Conclusions
We present a very large psychophysical dataset and use this to correlate molecular features of a stimulus to olfactory percept.

Here we characterize four repeated instances of convergent evolution of sperm gigantism in Caenorhabditis nematodes using phylogenetic comparative methods on 26 species. Species at the extreme end of the 50-fold range of sperm-cell volumes across the genus have sperm capable of comprising up to 5% of egg-cell volume, representing severe attenuation of the magnitude of anisogamy. Exploring potential genetic and developmental determinants of Caenorhabditis sperm size variation, we uncover significant differences in mean and variance of sperm size among genotypes, between sexes of androdioecious species, as well as within and between individuals of identical genotypes. We demonstrate that the developmental basis of sperm size variation, both within and between species, becomes established during an early stage of sperm development, i.e. at the formation of primary spermatocytes while subsequent meiotic divisions contribute little further sperm size variability. These findings provide first insights into the developmental determinants of inter- and intraspecific sperm size differences in Caenorhabditis. Together, our results provide a novel integrative view on the developmental and evolutionary origins of Caenorhabditis sperm size variation.

For decades, human infections with Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus, were sporadic, associated with mild disease, and went underreported since symptoms were similar to other acute febrile diseases endemic in the same regions. Recent reports of severe disease associated with ZIKV, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and severe fetal abnormalities, have greatly heightened awareness. Given its recent history of rapid spread in immune naive populations, it is anticipated that ZIKV will continue to spread in the Americas and globally in regions where competent Aedes mosquito vectors are found. Globally, dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted human flavivirus and is both well-established and the source of outbreaks in areas of recent ZIKV introduction. DENV and ZIKV are closely related, resulting in substantial antigenic overlap. Through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), anti-DENV antibodies can enhance the infectivity of DENV for certain classes of immune cells, causing increased viral production that correlates with severe disease outcomes. Similarly, ZIKV has been shown to undergo ADE in response to antibodies generated by other flaviviruses. However, response to DENV antibodies has not yet been investigated. 
Methodology / Principal Findings
We tested the neutralizing and enhancing potential of well-characterized broadly neutralizing human anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) and human DENV immune sera against ZIKV using neutralization and ADE assays. We show that anti-DENV HMAbs, cross-react, do not neutralize, and greatly enhance ZIKV infection in vitro. DENV immune sera had varying degrees of neutralization against ZIKV and similarly enhanced ZIKV infection.
Conclusions / Significance
Our results suggest that pre-existing DENV immunity will enhance ZIKV infection in vivo and may increase disease severity. A clear understanding of the interplay between ZIKV and DENV will be critical in informing public health responses in regions where these viruses co-circulate and will be particularly valuable for ZIKV and DENV vaccine design and implementation strategies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Clinical & Translational Immunology/Clinical & Translational Immunology1.pdf,"[( 17 May 2016 , 3), ( 20 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 13 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 01 May 2016 , 2), ( 17 Jun 2016 , 8), ( 02 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 05 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 25 May 2016 , 1), ( 30 Apr 2016 , 10), ( 29 May 2016 , 5), ( 15 May 2016 , 4), ( 30 May 2016 , 9), ( 02 May 2016 , 2), ( 19 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 08 May 2016 , 1), ( 01 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 02 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 18 May 2016 , 1), ( 16 May 2016 , 4), ( 16 Jun 2017 , 1), ( 23 Jun 2016 , 7), ( 03 May 2016 , 3), ( 04 May 2016 , 3), ( 07 May 2016 , 1), ( 29 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 10 May 2016 , 3), ( 18 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 09 May 2016 , 4), ( 11 May 2016 , 2), ( 03 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 29 Apr 2016 , 7), ( 05 May 2016 , 1), ( 09 Oct 2016 , 1)]"

However, human populations have complex structures formed by social contacts, which can have a significant influence on the rate of epidemic spread. Contact network models capture this structure by explicitly representing each contact which could possibly lead to a transmission. We developed a method based on kernel approximate Bayesian computation (kernel-ABC) for estimating structural parameters of the contact network underlying an observed viral phylogeny. The method combines adaptive sequential Monte Carlo for ABC, Gillespie simulation for propagating epidemics though networks, and a kernel-based tree similarity score. We used the method to fit the Barabási-Albert network model to simulated transmission trees, and also applied it to viral phylogenies estimated from five published HIV sequence datasets. On simulated data, we found that the preferential attachment power and the number of infected nodes in the network can often be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the mean degree of the network, as well as the total number of nodes, were not estimable with kernel-ABC. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the parameter estimates on real datasets, with point estimates for the preferential attachment power ranging from 0.06 to 1.05.

These methods are essentially based on simple epidemiological models because of the difficulty in expressing the likelihood function analytically.
Computing this function numerically raises additional challenges, especially for large phylogenies.
Here, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to circumvent these problems.
ABC is a likelihood-free method of parameter inference, based on simulation and comparison between target data and simulated data, using summary statistics.
We simulated target trees under several epidemiological scenarios in order to assess the accuracy of ABC methods for inferring epidemiological parameter such as the basic reproduction number (R0), the mean duration of infection, and the effective host population size.
We designed many summary statistics to capture the information in a phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot.
We then used the simplest ABC method, called rejection, and its modern derivative complemented with adjustment of the posterior distribution by regression.
The availability of machine learning techniques including variable selection, motivated us to compute many summary statistics on the phylogeny.
We found that ABC-based inference reaches an accuracy comparable to that of likelihood-based methods for birth-death models and can even outperform existing methods for more refined models and large trees.
By re-analysing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we also found that ABC provides more realistic estimates than the likelihood-based methods, for some parameters.

This explains why considerable research effort is being expended to try to develop anti-craving strategies for relapse prevention. Recently, we discovered using the classic reinstatement model of cocaine craving that the reinstating or priming effect of cocaine can be extinguished with repeated priming in rats, a phenomenon dubbed extinction of cocaine priming. Here we sought to measure the potential beneficial effect of this novel extinction strategy on subsequent relapse (i.e., return to the pre-extinction pattern of cocaine self-administration once the drug is made again available after extinction). Overall and contrary to our initial hope, extensive and complete extinction of cocaine priming had no major impact on relapse. This lack of effect occurred despite evidence for post-extinction loss of neuronal responses to cocaine priming in brain regions critically involved in cocaine-induced reinstatement (i.e., the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens). An effect of extinction of cocaine priming on relapse was only observed when cocaine was available for self-administration under more demanding conditions. However, this effect was modest and short-lived. Finally, we succeeded to trace the origin of our failure to prevent relapse to a persistent, extinction-resistant form of operant behavior that is not directly induced by cocaine. This extinction-resistant behavior is commonly reported, though generally ignored as causally irrelevant, in many other reinstatement studies. We propose that this behavior should become both a novel marker for long-term vulnerability to relapse and a novel target for preclinical development of potential relapse prevention interventions.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1425.pdf,"[( 28 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 27 Apr 2016 , 10), ( 26 Apr 2016 , 4)]"

A total 20 geographical isolates were collected from different regions of North India, covering a major part of its species range within the Indian Subcontinent. Sequence data from nuclear-encoded Internal Transcribed Spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and plastid-encoded trnL-F spacer region, were generated for this species for the first time in the world.  ITS-based Bayesian phylogeographic analysis revealed the existence of four clades while trnL-F spacer based Bayesian analysis revealed one clade for this species distributed in the Indian subcontinent.

Comparisons of new archaic hominin paleogenome sequences with modern human genomes have confirmed a history of genetic admixture - and thus direct contact - between humans and Neandertals. Analyses of these data have also shown that Neandertal nuclear genome genetic diversity was likely considerably lower than that of the Eurasian anatomically modern humans with whom they came into contact, perhaps leaving Neandertal innate immune systems relatively more susceptible to novel pathogens. In this study, we compared levels of genetic diversity in genes for which genetic variation is hypothesized to benefit pathogen defense among Neandertals and African, European, and Asian modern humans, using available exome sequencing data (six chromosomes per population).

Using known features of osmotic stress signaling and results presented by the authors, I argue that glycerol concentration -the integral of the rate of glycerol accumulation (synthesis versus leakage)- transforms metabolic energy into increased osmolarity that drives water influx and restoration of turgor pressure.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are a type of polymorphism found to underlie phenotypic variation, both in humans and livestock. Most surveys of CNV in livestock have been conducted in the cattle genome, and often utilise only a single approach for the detection of copy number differences. Here we performed a study of CNV in sheep, using multiple methods to identify and characterise copy number changes.  Comprehensive information from small pedigrees (trios) was collected using multiple platforms (array CGH, SNP chip and whole genome sequence data), with these data then analysed via multiple approaches to identify and verify CNVs.

Results.
In total, 3,488 autosomal CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified from 30 sheep. The average length of the identified CNVRs was 19kb (range of 1kb to 3.6Mb), with shorter CNVRs being more frequent than longer CNVRs. The total length of all CNVRs was 67.6Mbps, which equates to 2.7% of the sheep autosomes.  For individuals this value ranged from 0.24 to 0.55%, and the majority of CNVRs were identified in single animals. Rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the genome, CNVRs tended to be clustered.  Application of three independent approaches for CNVR detection facilitated a comparison of validation rates. CNVs identified on the Roche-NimbleGen 2.1M CGH array generally had low validation rates, while whole genome sequence data had the highest validation rate. 
 
Conclusions.
This study represents the first comprehensive survey of the distribution, prevalence and characteristics of CNVR in sheep. Multiple approaches were used to detect CNV regions and it appears that the best method for verifying CNVR on a large scale involves using a combination of detection methodologies.  The characteristics of the 3,488 autosomal CNV regions identified in this study are comparable to other CNV regions reported in the literature and provide a valuable addition to the small subset of published sheep CNVs.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics44.pdf,"[( 27 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 26 Feb 2016 , 4)]"

The ability of next-generation sequencing to produce massive quantities of genomic data inexpensively has allowed virologists to study the structure of viral populations from an infected host at an unprecedented resolution. However, high similarity and low frequency of the viral variants impose a huge challenge to assembly of individual full-length genomes. The long read length offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allows each mutant variant to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high error rate limits the ability to reconstruct heterogeneous viral population composed of rare, related mutant variants. In this paper, we present 2SNV, a method able to tolerate the high error-rate of the single-molecule protocol and reconstruct mutant variants.  The proposed protocol is able to eliminate sequencing errors and reconstruct closely related viral mutant variants. 2SNV uses linkage between single nucleotide variations to efficiently distinguish them from read errors. To benchmark the sensitivity of 2SNV, we performed a single-molecule sequencing experiment on a sample containing a titrated level of known viral mutant variants.
Our method is able to accurately reconstruct clone with frequency of 0.2% and distinguish clones that differed in only two nucleotides distantly located on the genome. 2SNV outperforms existing methods for full-length viral mutant reconstruction. With high sensitivity and accuracy, 2SNV is anticipated to facilitate not only viral quasispecies reconstruction, but also other biological questions that require detection of rare haplotypes such as genetic diversity in cancer cell population, and monitoring B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoire.

To address these challenges, we utilize the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to evaluate whether drug synergy or antagonism is mediated through genetic interactions between their target genes. Specifically, we hypothesize that if the inhibition targets of one chemical compound are in close proximity to those of a second compound in a genetic interaction network, then the compound pair will exhibit synergy or antagonism. Graph metrics are employed to make precise the notion of proximity in a network. Knowledge of genetic interactions and small-molecule targets are compiled through literature sources and curated databases, with predictions validated according to experimentally determined gold standards. Finally, we test whether genetic interactions propagate through networks according to a ``guilt-by-association'' framework. Our results suggest that close proximity between the target genes of one drug and those of another drug does not strongly predict synergy or antagonism.

We show that tree crickets harness active processes to ensure that auditory tuning remains matched to conspecific song frequency, despite changing environmental conditions and signal characteristics.

Cyanogenesis protects plants from herbivores, but also reduces freezing tolerance. Plants evolved reduced cyanogenesis with increasing proximity to the urban center in three of the four cities. In an experiment, we demonstrate that gradients in herbivore pressure do not cause these clines.

Conventional and super-resolution light microscopy identified significantly elevated frequencies of Shh/ZRS co-localisation only in the Shh expressing regions of the limb bud.

Shh/ZRS co-localisation, therefore, correlates with the spatiotemporal domain of limb bud-specific Shh expression, but close Shh/ZRS proximity in the nucleus occurs regardless of whether the gene or enhancer is active.

Such changes are currently occurring in nettle-feeding butterflies in Sweden where Araschnia levana has recently expanded its range northward and is now likely to interact with the resident species (Aglais urticae and Aglais io). Butterfly occurrence data collected over years and across regions enabled us to investigate how a recent range expansion of A. levana may have affected the environmental niche of resident species. 
Location We focused on two regions of Sweden (Skåne and Norrström) where A. levana has and has not established, and two time-periods (2001-2006, 2009-2012) during its establishment in Skåne. 
Methods We performed two distinct analyses in each region using the PCA-env and the framework described in Broennimann et al. (2012). First, we described the main sources of variation in the environment. Second, in each time-period and region, we characterized the realized niches of our focal species across topographic and land use gradients. Third, we quantified overlaps and differences in realized niches between and within species over time.
Results In Skåne, A. levana has stabilized its distribution over time while the distribution of the native species has shifted. These shifts depicted a consistent pattern of avoiding overlap between the native species and the environmental space occupied by A. levana, and it was stronger for A. urticae than for A. io. In both regions, we also found evidence of niche partitioning between native species.
Main conclusions Interspecific interactions are likely to affect local species distributions. It appears that the ongoing establishment of A. levana has modified local biotic interactions, and induced shifts in resident species' distributions. Among the mechanisms that can explain such patterns of niche partitioning, parasitoid-driven apparent competition may play an important role in this community.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1441.pdf,"[( 14 Sep 2015 , 1), ( 15 Sep 2015 , 6), ( 24 Jun 2016 , 1)]"

Background
Changes in brain connectivity in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been investigated using graph analysis.  However, these studies were based on small data sets, explored a limited range of network parameters, and did not focus on more restricted sub-networks, where neurodegenerative processes may introduce more prominent alterations. 
Methods
In this study, we constructed structural brain networks out of 87 regions by using data from 135 healthy elders and 100 early AD patients selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We evaluated the graph properties of these networks by investigating metrics of network efficiency, small world properties, segregation, product measures of complexity, and entropy. Because degenerative processes take place at different rates in different brain areas, analysis restricted to sub-networks may reveal changes otherwise undetected. Therefore, we first analyzed the graph properties of a network encompassing all brain areas considered together, and then repeated the analysis after dividing the brain areas into two sub-networks constructed by applying a clustering algorithm.  
Results
At the level of large scale network, the analysis did not reveal differences between AD patients and controls. In contrast, the same analysis performed on the two sub-networks revealed modifications accompanying AD. Changes in small world properties suggested that the ability to engage concomitantly in integration and segregation of information diminished with AD in the sub-network containing the areas of medial temporal lobe known to be heaviest and earliest affected. In contrast, we found that the second network showed an increase in small world propensity, a novel metric that unbiasedly quantifies small world structure. Complexity and entropy measures indicated that the intricacy of connection patterns and structural diversity decreased in both sub-networks.  
Conclusions
These results show that neurodegenerative processes impact volumetric networks in a non-global fashion. Our findings provide new quantitative insights into topological principles of structural brain networks and their modifications during early stages of Alzheimer's disease.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Brain Structure and Function/Brain Structure and Function2.pdf,"[( 02 May 2016 , 1), ( 30 Apr 2016 , 1), ( 29 Apr 2016 , 5)]"

Thus, to our knowledge, no information is available on theory and efficiency of GWAS in open-pollinated populations. Our objectives are to present quantitative genetics theory for GWAS, evaluate the relative efficiency of GWAS in non-inbred and inbred populations and in an inbred lines panel, and assess factors affecting GWAS, such as linkage disequilibrium (LD), sample size, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) heritability. Fifty samples of 400 individuals from populations with LD were simulated. Individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for traits with different degrees of dominance controlled by 10 QTLs and 90 minor genes. The average SNP density was 0.1 centiMorgan and the trait heritabilities were 0.4 and 0.8. We assessed GWAS efficiency based on the power of QTL detection, number of false-positive associations, bias in the estimated QTL position, and range of the significant SNPs for the same QTL. When the LD between a QTL and one or more SNPs is restricted to markers very close to or within the QTL, GWAS in open-pollinated populations can be highly efficient, depending mainly on QTL heritability and sample size. GWAS achieved the highest power of QTL detection, the smallest number of false-positive associations, and the lowest bias in the estimated QTL position for the inbred lines panel correcting for population structure. Under low QTL heritability and reduced sample size, GWAS is ineffective for non-inbred and inbred populations and for inbred lines panel.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1443.pdf,"[( 30 Apr 2016 , 2), ( 04 May 2016 , 1), ( 29 Apr 2016 , 5)]"

First, Earths prebiotic chemical evolution is historically continuous with Darwinian evolution; second, cycling energies of solar radiation are primary drivers of chemical evolution; third, environmental molecular complexity must be high at the origin of life; and fourth, noncovalent molecular forces determine molecular recognition and cellular organization. Under normal physiological conditions of high ionic strength and high macromolecular crowding, hydration interactions (hydrogen bonding), screened electrostatic forces and excluded volume repulsions act over a commensurate distance of about one nanometer. This intermolecular distance governs chemical coevolution of protobiomacromolecular surfaces (nucleic acids, proteins and membranes) toward Darwinian thresholds and living states. The above physicochemical principles of lifes emergence are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, and with the current facts of molecular microbiology and planetary sciences.

While subsequent studies using rearing treatment water (control or high CO2) in the test arena have confirmed the effects of high CO2 on a range of reef fish behaviours, a further investigation into the use of different test water in the experimental arena is warranted. Here, we used a fully factorial design to test the effect of rearing treatment water (control or high CO2) and experimental test water (control or high CO2) on antipredator responses of larval reef fishes. We tested antipredator behaviour in larval clownfish Amphiprion percula and ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis, two species that have been used in previous high CO2 experiments. Specifically we tested if: 1) using control or high CO2 water in a two channel flume influenced the response of larval clownfish to predator odour, and 2) using control or high CO2 water in the test arena influenced the escape response of larval damselfish to a startle stimulus. Finally, 3) because the effects of high CO2 on fish behaviour appear to be caused by altered function of the GABA-A neurotransmitter we tested if antipredator behaviours were restored in clownfish treated with a GABA antagonist (gabazine) in high CO2 water. Larval clownfish reared from hatching in control water (496 uatm) strongly avoided predator cue whereas larval clownfish reared from hatching in high CO2 (1022 uatm) were attracted to the predator cue, as has been reported in previous studies. There was no effect of testing fish using control or high CO2 water in the flume. Larval damselfish reared for 4 days in high CO2 (1051 uatm) exhibited a slower response to a startle stimulus, slower escape speed and a shorter escape distance compared with fish reared in control conditions (464 uatm). There was no effect of test water on escape responses. Treatment of high-CO2 reared clownfish with 4 mg l-1 gabazine in high CO2 seawater restored the normal response to predator odour, as has been previously reported with fish tested in control water.

They have the potential to cause great genomic change due to their ability to 'jump' around the genome and amplify themselves, resulting in the duplication and rearrangement of regulatory DNA. Active L1, in particular, are often thought of as tightly constrained, homologous and ubiquitous elements with well-characterised domain organisation. For the past 30 years, model organisms have been used to define L1s as 6-8kb sequences containing a 5'-UTR, two open reading frames working harmoniously in cis, and a 3'-UTR with a polyA tail.

In this study, we demonstrate the remarkable and overlooked diversity of L1s via a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of over 500 species from widely divergent branches of the tree of life. The rapid and recent growth of L1 elements in mammalian species is juxtaposed against their decline in plant species and complete extinction in most reptiles and insects. In fact, some of these previously unexplored mammalian species (e.g. snub-nosed monkey, minke whale) exhibit L1 retrotranspositional 'hyperactivity' far surpassing that of human or mouse. In contrast, non-mammalian L1s have become so varied that the current classification system seems to inadequately capture their structural characteristics. Our findings illustrate how both long-term inherited evolutionary patterns and random bursts of activity in individual species can significantly alter genomes, highlighting the importance of L1 dynamics in eukaryotes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Biology and Evolution/Genome Biology and Evolution21.pdf,"[( 29 Apr 2016 , 5)]"

By plotting these repair rates in relation to genes and their associated flanking sequences, we reveal that in normal cells, genomic repair rates display a distinctive pattern, suggesting that DNA repair is highly organised within the genome. Furthermore, by comparing genome-wide DNA repair rates in wild-type cells, and cells defective in the global genome-NER (GG-NER) sub-pathway, we establish how this alters the distribution of NER rates throughout the genome. We also examined the genomic locations of GG-NER factor binding to chromatin before and after UV irradiation revealing that GG-NER is organised and initiated from specific genomic locations. At these sites, chromatin occupancy of the histone acetyl transferase Gcn5 is controlled by the GG-NER complex, which regulates histone H3 acetylation and chromatin structure, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair of UV-induced lesions.

I describe a new approach that uses a null model based on high-throughput lab measurements of a gene's site-specific amino-acid preferences. This null model makes it possible to identify diversifying selection for amino-acid change and differential selection for mutations to amino acids that are unexpected given the measurements made in the lab. I show that this approach identifies sites of adaptive substitutions in four genes (lactamase, Gal4, influenza nucleoprotein, and influenza hemagglutinin) far better than a comparable method that simply compares the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions.

Mutant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) can be viewed as selfish genetic elements that persist in a state of heteroplasmy despite having potentially deleterious consequences to the organism. We sought to investigate mechanisms that allow selfish mtDNA to achieve and sustain high levels. Here, we establish a large 3.1kb deletion bearing mtDNA variant uaDf5 as a bona fide selfish genome in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Next, using droplet digital PCR to quantify mtDNA copy number, we show that uaDf5 mutant mtDNA replicates in addition to, not at the expense of, wildtype mtDNA. These data suggest existence of homeostatic copy number control for wildtype mtDNA that is exploited by uaDf5 to hitchhike to high frequency. We also observe activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in animals with uaDf5. Loss of UPRmt results in a decrease in uaDf5 frequency whereas constitutive activation of UPRmt increases uaDf5 levels. These data suggest that UPRmt allows uaDf5 levels to increase. Interestingly, the decreased uaDf5 levels in absence of UPRmt recover in parkin mutants lacking mitophagy, suggesting that UPRmt protects uaDf5 from mitophagy. We propose that cells activate two homeostatic responses, mtDNA copy number control and UPRmt, in uaDf5 heteroplasmic animals.

While DPs showed typical retinotopic organization of ventral visual cortex and normal pRF sizes in early visual areas, we found significantly reduced pRF sizes in face-selective regions and in intermediate areas hV4 and VO1.

Failure to regulate feeding may have devastating results, including obesity and diabetes, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. The nematode C. elegans, whose food uptake consists of pumping bacteria from the environment into the gut, provides excellent opportunities for discovering principles of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Here we show that worms implement a graded feeding response to the concentration of environmental bacteria by modulating a commitment to bursts of fast pumping. Using longterm, high-resolution, longitudinal recordings of feeding dynamics under defined conditions, we find that the frequency and duration of pumping bursts increase and the duration of long pauses diminishes in environments richer in bacteria. The bioamine serotonin, a known feeding regulator in metazoa, is required for food-dependent induction of bursts as well as for maintaining their high rate of pumping through two distinct mechanisms. Following this phenotype quantitatively we identify the essential serotonergic neurons and the differential roles of distinct families of serotonin receptors.

We confirmed the genetic continuity between the ancient and modern individuals and modeled the population collapse after European contact, inferring a 57% reduction in effective population size. We also identified signatures of positive selection on immune-related genes in the ancient but not the modern group. The strongest selection signal in the ancients came from the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene HLA-DQA1, with alleles that are close to fixation. The important immune function of HLA-DQA1 supports an ancient adaptation to the environments of the Americas. The modern individuals show a marked decrease in the frequency of the associated alleles (the most pronounced variant showing a 64% difference). This decrease is likely due to the environmental change associated with European colonization, which resulted in a shift of selection pressures, whereby negative selection may have acted on the same gene after contact. Furthermore, the selection pressure shift could correlate to the European-borne epidemics of the 1800s, suffered in the Northwest Coast region.

Methods: We used a validated mathematical method to calculate energy intake changes during a 52 week placebo-controlled trial in 153 patients treated with canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitor that increases urinary glucose excretion thereby resulting in weight loss without patients being directly aware of the energy deficit. We analyzed the relationship between the body weight time course and the calculated energy intake changes using principles from engineering control theory.

Results: We discovered that weight loss leads to a proportional homeostatic drive to increase energy intake above baseline by ~100 kcal/day per kg of lost weight - an amount more than 3-fold larger than the corresponding energy expenditure adaptations.

We show that an approach based on submodular optimization results in representative protein sequence subsets with greater functional diversity than sets chosen with existing methods. In particular, we compare to a widely used, heuristic algorithm implemented in software tools such as CD-HIT, using as a gold standard the SCOPe library of protein domain structures. In this setting, submodular optimization consistently yields protein sequence subsets that include more SCOPe domain families than sets of the same size selected by the heuristic approach.

Using targeted sequencing of 670 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies, we investigated the genetic basis of primary chemotherapy resistance and remission induction failure of 107 primary cases obtained at diagnosis from children and adults with cytogenetically normal AML. Comparative analysis revealed mutations of SETBP1, ASXL1 and RELN to be significantly enriched at diagnosis in primary induction failure as compared to remission cases. In addition, this analysis revealed novel genomic alterations not previously described in AML, as well as distinct genes that are significantly overexpressed in therapy resistant AML.

The current study reveals a role for purinergic signaling in HCMV infection. The levels of several components of the purinergic signaling system, including the P2Y2 receptor, were altered in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. P2Y2 receptor RNA and protein are strongly induced following infection. Pharmacological inhibition of receptor activity or knockdown of receptor expression markedly reduced the production of infectious HCMV progeny. When P2Y2 activity was inhibited, the accumulation of most viral RNAs tested and viral DNA was reduced. In addition, the level of cytosolic calcium within infected cells was reduced when P2Y2 signaling was blocked. The HCMV-coded UL37x1 protein was previously shown to induce calcium flux from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, and the present study demonstrates that P2Y2 function is required for this mobilization.

Resolution of this question has been thwarted by the fact that many modern introns appear to be hundreds of millions of years old, obscuring the mechanisms by which they were initially created.  As such, analysis of lineages undergoing rapid intron creation is crucial.  Recently, Hoy et al. reported the genome of the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis, revealing generally rapid molecular evolution including wholesale loss of ancestral introns and gain of new ones.  I sought to test several potential mechanisms of intron creation.  BLAST searches did not reveal patterns of similarity between intronic sequences from different sites or between intron sequences and non-intronic sequences, which would be predicted if introns are created by propagation of pre-existing intronic sequences or by transposable element insertion.  To test for evidence that introns are created by any of multiple mechanisms that are expected to lead to duplication of sequences at the two splice boundaries of an intron, I compared introns likely to have been gained in the lineage leading to M. occidentalis and likely ancestral introns.  These comparisons did initially reveal greater similarity between boundaries in M. occidentalis-specific introns, however this excess appeared to be largely or completely due to greater adherence of newer introns to the so-called protosplice site, and therefore may not provide strong evidence for particular intron gain mechanisms.  The failure to find evidence for particular intron creation mechanisms could reflect the relatively old age of even these introns, intron creation by variants of tested mechanisms that do not leave a clear sequence signature, or by intron creation by unimagined mechanisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1455.pdf,"[( 10 May 2016 , 2), ( 03 May 2016 , 1), ( 09 May 2016 , 2), ( 02 May 2016 , 7), ( 07 May 2016 , 4), ( 01 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Using spatial PCA on the full dataset, we detected patterns of population affinities in the area similar to those of genome-wide SNP and STR studies.

When coupled with large behavioral data sets, unsupervised clustering methods offer the potential of unbiased mapping of behavioral spaces. However, unsupervised techniques to map behavioral spaces are in their infancy, and there have been few systematic considerations of all the methodological options. We compared the performance of seven distinct mapping methods in clustering a data set consisting of the x- and y-positions of the six legs of individual flies. Legs were automatically tracked by small pieces of fluorescent dye, while the fly was tethered and walking on an air-suspended ball. We find that there is considerable variation in the performance of these mapping methods, and that better performance is attained when clustering is done in higher dimensional spaces (which are otherwise less preferable because they are hard to visualize). High dimensionality means that some algorithms, including the nonparametric watershed cluster assignment algorithm, cannot be used. We developed an alternative watershed algorithm which can be used in high-dimensional spaces when the probability density estimate can be computed directly. With these tools in hand, we examined the behavioral space of fly leg postural dynamics and locomotion. We find a striking division of behavior into modes involving the fore legs and modes involving the hind legs, with few direct transitions between them. By computing behavioral clusters using the data from all flies simultaneously, we show that this division appears to be common to all flies. We also identify individual-to-individual differences in behavior and behavioral transitions.

By not taking this into account, previous genetic studies implicitly assumed that the genetic effects are constant across time and space. We conduct a mega-analysis applying whole genome methods on 31,396 unrelated men and women from six Western countries. Across all individuals and environments, common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explained only  ~4% of the variance in NEB and AFB. We then extend these models to test whether genetic effects are shared across different environments or unique to them. For individuals belonging to the same population and demographic cohort (born before or after the 20th century fertility decline), SNP-based heritability was almost five times higher at 22% for NEB and 19% for AFB. We also found no evidence suggesting that genetic effects on fertility are shared across time and space. Our findings imply that the environment strongly modifies genetic effects on the tempo and quantum of fertility, that currently ongoing natural selection is heterogeneous across environments, and that gene-environment interactions may partly account for missing heritability in fertility.

The high density of differences between the maternally and paternally contributed sequences (heterozygous sites) in some organisms makes de novo genome assembly very challenging, even for algorithms specifically designed to deal with these cases. Therefore, various approaches, most commonly inbreeding in the laboratory, are used to reduce heterozygosity in genomic data prior to assembly. However, many species are not amenable to these techniques.
Results: We introduce trio-sga, a set of three algorithms designed to take advantage of mother-father-offspring trio sequencing to facilitate better quality genome assembly in organisms with moderate to high levels of heterozygosity. Two of the algorithms use haplotype phase information present in the trio data to eliminate the majority of heterozygous sites before the assembly commences. The third algorithm is designed to reduce sequencing costs by enabling the use of parents' reads in the assembly of the genome of the offspring. We test these algorithms on a 'simulated trio' from four haploid datasets, and further demonstrate their performance by assembling three highly heterozygous Heliconius butterfly genomes. While the implementation of trio-sga is tuned towards Illumina-generated data, we note that the trio approach to reducing heterozygosity is likely to have cross-platform utility for de novo assembly.
Availability: trio-sga is an extension of the sga genome assembler. It is available at https://github.com/millanek/trio-sga, written in C++, and runs multithreaded on UNIX- based systems.

Although most of these changes have important ecological and at times economic implications, they remain notoriously difficult to detect in advance. Here, we use a Ricker-type model to simulate the transition of a hypothetical stable fisheries population either to irregular boom-bust dynamics or to overexploitation. Our aim is to infer the risk of extinction in these two scenarios by comparing changes in variance, autocorrelation, and nonlinearity between unexploited and exploited populations. We find that changes in these statistical metrics reflect the risk of extinction but depend on the type of dynamical transition. Variance and nonlinearity increase similarly in magnitude along both transitions. In contrast, autocorrelation depends strongly on the presence of underlying oscillating dynamics. We also compare our theoretical expectations to indicators measured in long-term datasets of fish stocks from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation in the Eastern Pacific and from the Northeast Shelf in the Western Atlantic. Our results suggest that elevated variance and nonlinearity could be potentially used to rank exploited fish populations according to their risk of extinction.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1462.pdf,"[( 04 May 2016 , 5)]"

A scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency revealed a short segment on bovine chromosome 19 (Braunvieh haplotype 2, BH2) that was associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh cattle. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings and the pathophysiology of BH2 remain to be elucidated.

Results: The frequency of BH2 was 6.5 % in 8,446 Braunvieh animals from the national bovine genome databases. Both perinatal and juvenile mortality of BH2 homozygous calves were higher than the average in Braunvieh cattle resulting in a depletion of BH2 homozygous adult animals (P=9.3x10-12). The analysis of whole-genome sequence data from 54 Braunvieh animals uncovered a missense mutation in TUBD1 (rs383232842, p.H210R) that was compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2. The availability of sequence data of 236 animals from diverse bovine populations revealed that the missense mutation also segregated at a low frequency (1.7 %) in the Fleckvieh breed. A validation study in 37,314 Fleckvieh animals confirmed high juvenile mortality of homozygous calves (P=2.2x10-15). Our findings show that the putative disease allele is located on an ancestral haplotype that segregates in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. To unravel the pathophysiology of BH2, six homozygous animals were examined at the animal clinic. Clinical and pathological findings revealed that homozygous calves suffered from chronic airway disease possibly resulting from defective cilia in the respiratory tract.

Conclusions: A missense mutation in TUBD1 is associated with high perinatal and juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation is located on a common haplotype likely originating from an ancient ancestor of Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that deleterious alleles may segregate across closed cattle breeds without recent admixture. Homozygous calves suffer from chronic airway disease resulting in poor growth performance and high juvenile mortality. The respiratory manifestations resemble key features of diseases resulting from impaired function of airway cilia.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics45.pdf,"[( 17 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 02 Mar 2016 , 3)]"

These structures are often highly dynamic, with subunits in a continuous state of flux, binding to and falling off the filament. In spite of this constant turnover of their molecular parts, many cellular structures seem to maintain a well-defined size over time, which is often required for their proper functioning. One widely discussed mechanism of size regulation involves the cell maintaining a finite pool of protein subunits available for assembly. This finite pool mechanism can control the length of a single filament by having assembly proceed until the pool of free subunits is depleted to the point when assembly and disassembly are balanced. Still, this leaves open the question whether the same mechanism can provide size control for multiple filamentous structures that are assembled from a common pool of protein subunits, as is often the case in cells. We address this question by solving the steady-state master equation governing the stochastic assembly and disassembly of multi-filament structures made from a shared, finite pool of subunits. We find that, while the total number of subunits within a multi-filament structure is well defined, individual filaments within the structure have a wide, power-law distribution of lengths. We also compute the phase diagram for two multi-filament structures competing for the same pool of subunits and identify conditions for coexistence when both have a well-defined size. These predictions can be tested in cell experiments in which the size of the subunit pool or the number of filaments with a multifilament structure is tuned within a cell.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/The Journal Of Physical Chemistry B/The Journal Of Physical Chemistry B2.pdf,"[( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 03 Mar 2016 , 5)]"

Both types of networks have the same topology, and we compute MRFs for both families of networks to illustrate two different ways of constructing taxonomies to group the networks into clusters of related fungi and slime moulds. Although both network taxonomies generate intuitively sensible groupings of networks across species, treatments and laboratories, we find that clustering using the functional-network measure appears to give groups with lower intra-group variation in species or treatments.

In this paper, we show how to estimate inbreeding coefficients using genomic data from Pf clinical samples, providing a simple metric for assessing within-sample mixture that connects to an extensive literature in population genetics and conservation ecology. Features of the Pf genome mean that some standard methods for inbreeding coefficients and related F-statistics cannot be used directly.

Here, we identify a set of orthologous single-copy genes from transcriptome assemblies for the land snails and slugs (Eupulmonata) using a thorough approach to orthology determination involving manual alignment curation, gene tree assessment and sequencing from genomic DNA. We qualified the orthology of 500 nuclear, protein coding genes from the transcriptome assemblies of 21 eupulmonate species to produce the most complete gene data matrix for a major molluscan lineage to date, both in terms of taxon and character completeness. Exon-capture targeting 490 of the 500 genes (those with at least one exon > 120 bp) from 22 species of Australian Camaenidae successfully captured sequences of 2,825 exons (representing all targeted genes), with only a 3.7% reduction in the data matrix due to the presence of putative paralogs or pseudogenes. The automated pipeline Agalma retrieved the majority of the manually qualified 500 single-copy gene set and identified a further 375 putative single-copy genes, although it failed to account for fragmented transcripts resulting in lower data matrix completeness. This could potentially explain the minor inconsistencies we observed in the supported topologies for the 21 eupulmonate species between the manually curated and Agalma-equivalent dataset (sharing 458 genes).

We identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human genomes that are preserved in genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. The identified positionally conserved lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription factor loci with which they are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Strikingly, over half of all positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to distinct chromatin organization structures, overlapping the binding sites for the CTCF chromatin organizer and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of topologically associating domains (TADs).

In addition, abnormally shaped elongating spermatid heads and bulbous round spermatids were found in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. Electron microscopy revealed increased cytoplasmic vesicles, fiber-like structures, abnormal accumulation of mitochondria and decreased mature lysosomes. The few developed sperm had disrupted axoneme and retained cytoplasmic lobe components on the flagella. ODF2 and SPAG16L, two sperm flagella proteins failed to be incorporated into sperm tails of the mutant mice. Expression levels of an autophagy core protein that associates with IFT20, Atg16, were significantly reduced in the testis of the Ift20 mutant mice. Our studies suggest that IFT20 is essential for spermiogenesis in mice, and it plays a role in sperm flagella formation, and removing excess cytoplasmic components by regulating autophagy core proteins.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1468.pdf,"[( 04 May 2016 , 5), ( 10 Sep 2016 , 1)]"

Because the method relies on summary level results data, LD score regression is computationally tractable even for very large sample sizes. However, publicly available GWAS summary-level data are typically stored in different databases and have different formats, making it difficult to apply LD score regression to estimate genetic correlations across many different traits simultaneously. 
Results: In this manuscript, we describe LD Hub - a centralized database of summary-level GWAS results for 177 diseases/traits from different publicly available resources/consortia and a web interface that automates the LD score regression analysis pipeline. To demonstrate functionality and validate our software, we replicated previously reported LD score regression analyses of 49 traits/diseases using LD Hub; and estimated SNP heritability and the genetic correlation across the different phenotypes. We also present new results obtained by uploading a recent atopic dermatitis GWAS meta-analysis to examine the genetic correlation between the condition and other potentially related traits. In response to the growing availability of publicly accessible GWAS summary-level results data, our database and the accompanying web interface will ensure maximal uptake of the LD score regression methodology, provide a useful database for the public dissemination of GWAS results, and provide a method for easily screening hundreds of traits for overlapping genetic aetiologies.

My study sample includes individuals of European ancestry born between 1931 and 1953 in the Health and Retirement Study, a representative study of the US population.

Temporal methods provide a powerful and simple approach to estimate short-term Ne. They use allele frequency shifts between temporal samples to calculate the standardized variance, which is directly related to Ne. Here we focus on experimental evolution studies that often rely on repeated sequencing of samples in pools (Pool-Seq). Pool-Seq is cost-effective and outperforms individual-based sequencing in estimating allele frequencies, but it is associated with atypical sampling properties:  additional to sampling individuals, sequencing DNA in pools leads to a second round of sampling increasing the estimated allele frequency variance. We propose a new estimator of Ne, which relies on allele frequency changes in temporal data and corrects for the variance in both sampling steps. In simulations, we obtain accurate Ne estimates, as long as the drift variance is not too small compared to the sampling and sequencing variance. In addition to genome-wide Ne estimates, we extend our method using a recursive partitioning approach to estimate Ne locally along the chromosome. Since type I error is accounted for, our method permits the identification of genomic regions that differ significantly in Ne. We present an application to Pool-Seq data from experimental evolution with Drosophila, and provide recommendations for whole-genome data.

Through interactions with membrane potential, ion channels both control metabolic events and mediate cell communication. Consequentially, membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuroscience. Conductance models have proven successful in quantitatively capturing these dynamics but are often considered difficult, with interpretation relegated to specialists. To facilitate research in membrane dynamics, especially in fields where roles for ion channels are just beginning to be quantified, we must make these models easy to understand.

Here, we show that the membrane differential equation central to conductance models can be understood using simple circular geometry. The membrane state diagrams we construct are compact, faithful representations of conductance model state, designed to look like circular ""cells"" with currents flowing in and out. Every feature of a membrane state diagram corresponds to a physiological variable, so that insight taken from a diagram can be translated back to the underlying model. The construction is elementary: we convert conductances to angles subtended on the circle and potentials to radii; currents are then areas of the enclosed annular sectors. 

Our method clarifies a powerful but prohibitive modeling approach and has the potential for widespread use in both electrophysiological research and pedagogy. We illustrate how membrane state diagrams can augment traditional methods in the stability analysis of voltage equilibria and in depicting the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential, and we use the diagrams to infer the possibility of nontrivial fixed-voltage channel population dynamics by visual inspection rather than linear algebra.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1470.pdf,"[( 05 May 2016 , 5)]"

We earlier reported it to improve life history traits and to suppress neurodegeneration as well as induced apoptosis in Drosophila. 
Aim of the study
To examine effects of dietary AR supplement on cell stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster. 
Materials and methods
Larvae/flies, reared on normal food or on that supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) AR, were exposed to crowding, thermal or oxidative stress and examined for survival, stress tolerance and levels of lipid peroxides, SOD and HSPs. 
Results
Wild type larvae/flies reared on AR supplemented food survived the various cell stresses much better than those reared on normal food. AR-fed mutant park-13 or DJ-1beta-delta93 (Parkinsons disease model) larvae, however, showed only partial or no protection, respectively, against paraquat-induced oxidative stress, indicating essentiality of DJ-1beta; for AR mediated oxidative stress tolerance. AR feeding reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation even in aged (35 day old) wild type flies while enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We show for the first time that while Hsp70 or Hsp83 expression under normal or stress conditions was not differentially affected by AR feeding, Hsp27 levels were elevated in AR fed wild type control as well as heat shocked larvae. Therefore, besides the known anti-oxidant activity of Phyllanthus emblica fruits, dietary AR also enhances cellular levels of Hsp27. 
Conclusion
In the context of the reported anti-aging and healthy-aging effects of AR, the present in vivo study on a model organisms shows that AR feeding significantly improves tolerance to a variety of cell stresses through reduced ROS and lipid peroxidation and enhanced SOD activity and Hsp27. Such improved cellular defences following dietary AR provide better homeostasis and thereby improve the life-span and quality of life of the organism.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal of Biosciences/Journal of Biosciences2.pdf,[]

Here we formulate a multistable decision-switch model involving many possible phenotypes with the antagonistic influence of parasitism. As expected, pathogens can drive dominant (common) phenotypes to become inferior, such as through negative frequency-dependent selection. Furthermore, novel predictions of our model show that parasitism can steer the dynamics of phenotype specification from multistable equilibrium convergence to oscillations. This oscillatory behavior could explain pathogen-mediated epimutations and excessive phenotypic plasticity.

The problem is that correlations between traits make it difficult to distinguish between direct and indirect selection. A phenotype is a direct target of selection when that trait in particular was shaped by selection to better perform a function. An indirect target of selection, also known as an evolutionary spandrel, is a phenotype that changes only because it is correlated with another trait under direct selection. Studies that mutate genes and examine the phenotypic consequences are increasingly common, and these experiments could estimate the mutational accessibility of the phenotypic changes that arise during an instance of adaptive molecular evolution. Under indirect selection, we expect phenotypes to evolve toward states that are more accessible by mutation. Deviation from this null expectation (evolution toward a phenotypic state rarely produced by mutation) would be compelling evidence of adaptation, and could be used to distinguish direct selection from indirect selection on correlated traits. To be practical, this molecular test of adaptation requires phenotypic differences that are caused by changes in a small number of genes. These kinds of genetically simple traits have been observed in many empirical studies of adaptive evolution.

Examples include olfactory receptor gene clusters involved in the recognition of diverse odors, defensin and phospholipase gene clusters involved in snake venoms, and Hox gene clusters involved in morphological diversity. Historically, gene clusters have been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several paralogs, however, their genomic arrangements are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. For example, the prolactin gene cluster shows variation in paralogous gene number, order and intergenic distance across mammals, whereas animal Hox gene clusters are often broken into sub-clusters of different sizes. A lack of formal definition for clusters of gene paralogs does not only hamper the study of their evolutionary dynamics, but also the discovery of novel ones in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CGPFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of clusters of gene paralogs (CGPs) by examining the physical distribution of individual gene members of families of paralogous genes across chromosomes. Application of CGPFinder to diverse mammalian genomes accurately identified CGPs for many well-known gene clusters in the human and mouse genomes (e.g., Hox, protocadherin, Siglec, and beta-globin gene clusters) as well as for 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences were due to the exclusion of non-homologous genes that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of one or more genes between the CGPs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CGPs. Finally, examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CGPFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450, aquaporins, and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating the identification of CGPs and of genes that are members of CGPs, CGPFinder will facilitate furthering our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of genomic neighborhoods containing CGPs, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1473.pdf,"[( 05 May 2016 , 4), ( 16 May 2016 , 4), ( 28 May 2016 , 1), ( 06 May 2016 , 7)]"

Among several experimentally observed features, the model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS activation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid influx of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1 to 5 minutes) is followed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1474.pdf,"[( 11 May 2016 , 1), ( 05 May 2016 , 1), ( 06 May 2016 , 1)]"

For this study, we used RNAseq to characterize the brain transcriptome of the three male tactics and females during spawning to identify gene categories associated with each tactic and identify potential candidate genes influencing their different spawning behaviors. We found that sneaker males had higher levels of gene differentiation compared to the other two male tactics.

Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell-type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology. Tissue-specific/selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.

Corresponding cellular models of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression associate synaptic strength with either spine enlargement or spine shrinkage. Although a variety of automatic spine segmentation and feature extraction methods were developed recently, no approaches allowing for an automatic and unbiased distinction between dendritic spine subpopulations and detailed computational models of spine behavior exist.

We propose an automatic and statistically based method for the unsupervised construction of spine shape taxonomy based on arbitrary features. The taxonomy is then utilized in the newly introduced computational model of behavior, which relies on transitions between shapes.  Models of different populations are compared using supplied bootstrap-based statistical tests. 

We compared two populations of spines at two time points. The first population was stimulated with long-term potentiation, and the other in the resting state was used as a control. The comparison of shape transition characteristics allowed us to identify differences between population behaviors. Although some extreme changes were observed in the stimulated population, statistically significant differences were found only when whole models were compared. Therefore, we hypothesize that the learning process is related to the subtle changes in the whole ensemble of different dendritic spine structures, but not at the level of single shape classes.

In particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory argues that there is a computational trade-off between learning the specifics of individual experiences and regularities that hold across those experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a neural network model that instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and subfields to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We found that the monosynaptic pathway - the pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to region CA1 - was able to support statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway - connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate gyrus and CA3 - learned only individual episodes, with apparent representations of regularities resulting from associative reactivation through recurrence.

Methods: We sequenced new transcriptomes for Barnadesia, the lineage sister to all other Compositae, and four representatives of closely related families. Using a recently developed algorithm, MAPS, we analyzed nuclear gene family phylogenies for evidence of paleopolyploidy.

Key results: We found that the previously recognized Compositae paleopolyploidy is also in the ancestry of the Calyceraceae. Our phylogenomic analyses uncovered evidence for a successive second round of genome duplication among all sampled Compositae except Barnadesia.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed for 119 prokaryotes representing 2 phyla under Archaea and 11 phyla under Bacteria after comparing multiple sequence alignments for 15 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptides. The topology of Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides varied substantially. We use Euclidean geometry to estimate all-pairs distances in order to construct phylogenetic trees. Further, we used a novel 'Taxonomic fidelity' algorithm to estimate clade by clade similarity between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic tree. We find that, as compared to trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides and rDNA sequences, the topology of our Euclidean tree and that for aligned and concatenated sequences of 15 proteins are closer to the taxonomic trees and offer the best consensus. We have also aligned sequences after concatenation, and find that by changing the order of sequence joining prior to alignment,  the tree topologies vary. In contrast, changing the types of polypeptides in the grouping for Euclidean trees does not affect the tree topologies.

Alternative splicing is the major post-transcriptional mechanism by which gene expression is regulated and affects a wide range of processes and responses in most eukaryotic organisms. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can generate genome-wide quantification of individual transcript isoforms to identify changes in expression and alternative splicing. RNA-seq is an essential modern tool but its ability to accurately quantify transcript isoforms depends on the diversity, completeness and quality of the transcript information. 
Results
We have developed a new Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) for RNA-seq analysis containing over 82k non-redundant transcripts, whereby 74,194 transcripts originate from 27,667 protein-coding genes. A total of 13,524 protein-coding genes have at least one alternatively spliced transcript in AtRTD2 such that about 60% of the 22,453 protein-coding, intron-containing genes in Arabidopsis undergo alternative splicing. More than 600 putative U12 introns were identified in more than 2,000 transcripts. AtRTD2 was generated from transcript assemblies of ca. 8.5 billion pairs of reads from 285 RNA-seq data sets obtained from 129 RNA-seq libraries and merged along with the previous version, AtRTD, and Araport11 transcript assemblies. AtRTD2 increases the diversity of transcripts and through application of stringent filters represents the most extensive and accurate transcript collection for Arabidopsis to date. We have demonstrated a generally good correlation of alternative splicing ratios from RNA-seq data analysed by Salmon and experimental data from high resolution RT-PCR. However, we have observed inaccurate quantification of transcript isoforms for genes with multiple transcripts which have variation in the lengths of their UTRs. This variation is not effectively corrected in RNA-seq analysis programmes and will therefore impact RNA-seq analyses generally. To address this, we have tested different genome-wide modifications of AtRTD2 to improve transcript quantification and alternative splicing analysis. As a result, we release AtRTD2-QUASI specifically for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms and demonstrate that it out-performs other available transcriptomes for RNA-seq analysis.
Conclusions
We have generated a new transcriptome resource for RNA-seq analyses in Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) designed to address quantification of different isoforms and alternative splicing in gene expression studies.  Experimental validation of alternative splicing changes identified inaccuracies in transcript quantification due to UTR length variation. To solve this problem, we also release a modified reference transcriptome, AtRTD2-QUASI for quantification of transcript isoforms, which shows high correlation with experimental data.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research46.pdf,"[( 10 May 2016 , 2), ( 06 May 2016 , 7), ( 09 May 2016 , 1), ( 11 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 07 May 2016 , 17), ( 12 May 2016 , 3), ( 08 May 2016 , 3), ( 16 May 2016 , 1), ( 27 Sep 2017 , 1), ( 11 Aug 2016 , 2)]"

Our approach is based on defining a correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system. We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1479.pdf,"[( 08 May 2016 , 4)]"

Recently, ourselves and others reported that in the diplomonad protist Giardia lamblia, the coding regions of several mRNAs are produced by ligation of independent RNA species expressed from distinct genomic loci.  Such trans-splicing of introns was found to affect nearly as many genes in this organism as does classical cis-splicing of introns.  These findings raised questions about the incidence of intron trans-splicing both across the G. lamblia transcriptome and across diplomonad diversity, however a dearth of transcriptomic data at the time prohibited systematic study of these questions.  Here, I leverage newly available transcriptomic data from G. lamblia and the related diplomonad Spironucleus salmonicida to search for trans-spliced introns.  My computational pipeline recovers all four previously reported trans-spliced introns in G. lamblia, suggesting good sensitivity.  Scrutiny of thousands of potential cases revealed only a single additional trans-spliced intron in G. lamblia, in the p68 helicase gene, and no cases in S. salmonicida.  The p68 intron differs from the previously reported trans-spliced introns in its high degree of streamlining: the core features of G. lamblia trans-spliced introns closely packed together, revealing striking efficiency in the implementation of a seemingly inherently inefficient molecular mechanism.  These results serve to circumscribe the role of trans-splicing both in terms of genes effected and taxonomically.  Future work should focus on the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins and phenotypic implications of this intriguing phenomenon.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PeerJ/PeerJ20.pdf,"[( 09 May 2016 , 1), ( 08 May 2016 , 5)]"

However, future activation is not always observed and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving simply as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may mark enhancers for spatial activation during tissue patterning.

Light limitation is associated with selective forces as well as reduced exposure to mutagens, and over evolutionary timescales it can leave a footprint on species genome.  Here we present the chloroplast genomes of four green algae (Bryopsidales, Ulvophyceae), including the endolithic (limestone-boring) alga Ostreobium quekettii, which is a low light specialist. We use phylogenetic models and comparative genomic tools to investigate whether the chloroplast genome of Ostreobium corresponds to our expectations of how low light would affect genome evolution. Ostreobium has the smallest and most gene-dense chloroplast genome among Ulvophyceae reported to date, matching our expectation that light limitation would impose resource constraints. Rates of molecular evolution are significantly slower along the phylogenetic branch leading to Ostreobium, in agreement with the expected effects of low light and energy levels on molecular evolution. Given the exceptional ability of our model organism to photosynthesize under extreme low light conditions, we expected to observe positive selection in genes related to the photosynthetic machinery. However, we observed stronger purifying selection in these genes, which might either reflect a lack of power to detect episodic positive selection followed by purifying selection and/or a strengthening of purifying selection due to the loss of a gene related to light sensitivity.

Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary - the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents.

Recent data have revised this picture in two important ways. First, the physical origin of chirality has been identified; cytoskeletal dynamics underlie the asymmetry of single cell behavior and of patterning of the left-right axis.  Second, the pathway is not linear: early disruptions that alter the normal sidedness of upstream asymmetric genes do not necessarily induce defects in the laterality of the downstream genes or in organ situs. Thus, the LR pathway is a unique example of two fascinating aspects of biology: the interplay of physics and genetics in establishing large-scale anatomy, and regulative (shape-homeostatic) pathways that correct errors of patterning over time. Here, we review aspects of asymmetry from its intracellular, cytoplasmic origins to the recently-uncovered ability of the LR control circuitry to achieve correct gene expression and morphology despite reversals of key ″determinant″ genes.

Recently, they have been found to have important roles in antibiotic resistance and in affecting production of metabolites used in industrial and agricultural applications. However, their characterization through deep sequencing remains challenging, in spite of rapid drops in cost and throughput increases for sequencing. Here, we attempt to ameliorate this situation by introducing a new plasmid-specific assembly algorithm, leveraging assembly graphs provided by a conventional de novo assembler and alignments of paired-end reads to assembled graph nodes. We introduce the first tool for this task, called Recycler, and demonstrate its merits in comparison with extant approaches. We show that Recycler greatly increases the number of true plasmids recovered while remaining highly accurate. On simulated plasmidomes, Recycler recovered 5 to 14% more true plasmids compared to the best extant method with overall precision of about 90%. We validated these results in silico on real data, as well as in vitro by PCR validation performed on a subset of Recycler's predictions on different data types. All 12 of Recycler's outputs on isolate samples matched known plasmids or phages, and had alignments having at least 97% identity over at least 99% of the reported reference sequence lengths. For the two E. Coli strains examined, most known plasmid sequences were recovered, while in both cases additional plasmids only known to be present in different hosts were found. Recycler also generated plasmids in high agreement with known annotation on real plasmidome data. Moreover, in PCR validations performed on 77 sequences, Recycler showed mean accuracy of 89% across all data types - isolate, microbiome, and plasmidome.

How coupling between stochastic expression and cell cycle impacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well understood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random bursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle. Formulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are derived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and stochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions from bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules between daughter cells.  These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off: cell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty expression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We  investigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell cycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a zero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring just before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed mean protein level.  In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of partitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide examples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell cycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle decisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1487.pdf,"[( 09 May 2016 , 2)]"

Growing sequence datasets are uncovering large numbers of rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in coding regions, many of which may even be unique to single individuals. The rarity of such variants makes it difficult to use conventional variant-phenotype associations as a means of predicting their potential impacts. As such, protein structures may help to provide the needed means for inferring otherwise difficult-to-discern rare SNV-phenotype associations. Previous efforts have sought to quantify the effects of SNVs on structures by evaluating their impacts on global stability. However, local perturbations can severely impact functionality (such as catalysis,allosteric regulation, interactions and specificity) without strongly disrupting global stability.Here, we describe a workflow in which localized frustration (which quantifies unfavorable residue-residue interactions) is employed as a metric to investigate such effects. We apply frustration to study the impacts of a large number of SNVs available throughout a number of next-generation sequencing datasets. Most of our observations are intuitively consistent: we observe that disease-associated SNVs have a strong proclivity to induce strong changes in localized frustration, and rare variants tend to disrupt local interactions to a larger extent than do common variants. Furthermore, we observe that somatic SNVs associated with oncogenes induce stronger perturbations at the surface, whereas those associated with tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) induce stronger perturbations in the interior. These findings are consistent with the notion that gain-of-function (for oncogenes) and loss-of-function events (for TSGs) may act through changes in regulatory interactions and basic functionality, respectively.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research47.pdf,"[( 26 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 09 May 2016 , 3), ( 08 May 2016 , 8)]"

We measured both testes size and genital spine length in monogamous and polyandrous treatments over seven generations.  We found that testes size was not significantly different between treatments, but that genital spine length was significantly longer in the polyandrous treatment within seven generations.

We model a population of individuals who cooperate to produce and divide a resource, and choose their cooperative partners based on how they are willing to divide the resource. Agent-based simulations, an analytical model, and extended simulations using neural networks provide converging evidence that equity is the best evolutionary strategy in such an environment: individuals maximize their fitness by dividing benefits in proportion to their own and their partners' relative contribution. The need to be chosen as a cooperative partner thus creates a selection pressure strong enough to explain the evolution of preferences for equity.

To assess how deer have broadly affected patterns of tree recruitment across northern Wisconsin, we analyzed recruitment success in 11 common trees species that vary in palatability across 13,105 USFS - FIA plots sampled between 1983 and 2013. We also examined how recruitment in these species covaried with estimated deer densities here. Saplings of five palatable species were scarce relative to less palatable species and showed highly skewed distributions. Scarcity and skew provide reliable signals of deer impacts even when deer have severely reduced recruitment and/or no reliable deer density data are available.  Deer densities ranged from 2.3-23 deer per km2 over a 30 year period. Sapling numbers in two maples (Acer) and aspen (Populus) with intermediate palatability declined sharply in apparent response to higher deer density. Path analysis also reveals that deer act to cumulatively depress sapling recruitment in these species over successive decades. Together, these approaches show that deer have strongly depressed sapling recruitment in all taxa except Abies and Picea. As these impacts are now propagating into larger sized trees, deer are also altering canopy composition composition and dynamics. The tools developed here provide efficient and reliable indicators for monitoring deer impacts on forest tree recruitment using consistent data collected by public agencies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1490.pdf,"[( 10 May 2016 , 5), ( 11 May 2016 , 1)]"

Here, we present a simple relationship between disease association statistics and the decline of linkage disequilibrium from a causal site.  A complete derivation of this relationship from a general disease model is shown for very large sample sizes.  Quite interestingly, this relationship holds across all modes of inheritance.  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations using a disease genetics model applied to chromosomes subjected to a standard model of recombination are employed to better understand the variation around this fine mapping theorem due to sampling effects.  We also use this relationship to provide a framework for estimating properties of a non-interrogated causal site using data at closely linked markers.

Here we show that this is in large part due to the non-uniformity of read coverage, even after intra-sample normalization, and that this is exacerbated in regions of low-mappability. To improve on this, we propose PopSV, an analytical method that uses multiple samples to control for technical variation and enables the robust detection of CNVs. We show that PopSV is able to detect up to 2.7 times more variants compared to previous methods, with an accuracy of about 90%. Applying PopSV to 640 normal and cancer whole-genome datasets, we demonstrate that CNVs affect on average 7.4 million DNA bases in each individual, a 23% increase over previous estimates. Notably, we find that regions of low-mappability are approximately 8 times more likely to harbor CNVs than the rest of the genome, which contrasts with somatic CNVs that are nearly uniformly distributed. In addition to the known enrichment in segmental duplication, we also observe that CNVs are enriched near centromeres and telomeres, in specific types of satellite and short tandem repeats, and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Although CNVs are found to be depleted in protein-coding genes, we identify 7206 genes with at least one exonic CNV, 682 of which harbored CNVs in low-mappability regions that would have been missed by other methods.

Using this resource, we find that ~20% of the schizophrenia risk loci have common variants that could explain regulation of brain gene expression. In five loci, these variants modulate expression of a single gene: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or SNAP91. Experimentally altered expression of three of them, FURIN, TSNARE1, and CNTN4, perturbs the proliferation and apoptotic index of neural progenitors and leads to neuroanatomical deficits in zebrafish. Furthermore, shRNA mediated knock-down of FURIN in neural progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells produces abnormal neural migration. Although 4.2% of genes (N = 693) display significant differential expression between cases and controls, 44% show some evidence for differential expression. All fold changes are ≤ 1.33, and an independent cohort yields similar differential expression for these 693 genes (r = 0.58). These findings are consistent with schizophrenia being highly polygenic, as has been reported in investigations of common and rare genetic variation. Co-expression analyses identify a gene module that shows enrichment for genetic associations and is thus relevant for schizophrenia.

Various processes are thought to maintain this balance across a range of stimuli/conditions. However, the developmental formation of this balance remains an open question, especially regarding the interplay between network blue-print (the spatial arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory nodes) and homeostatic processes. In this paper, we use a published model of activity-dependent growth to show that the E/I ratio alone cannot accurately predict system behaviour but rather it is the combination of this ratio and the underlying spatial arrangement of neurones that predict both activity in, and structure of, the resulting network. In particular, we highlight the particular role of clustered inter-inhibitory connectivity. We develop a measure that allows us to determine the relationship between inter-inhibitory connectivity clustering and system behaviour in an exhaustive list of spatial arrangements with a given fixed number of excitatory and inhibitory neurones. Our results reveal that, for a given E/I ratio, networks with high levels of inter-inhibitory clustering are more likely to experience oscillatory behaviour than networks with low levels, and we investigate the network attributes which characterise each global behaviour type produced by the model.

These genes are located in large repetitive sequences arranged as palindromes, inverted-, and tandem-repeats termed amplicons.  In humans, these genes have critical roles in male fertility and are essential for the production of sperm.  The structure of human and chimpanzee amplicon sequences show remarkable difference relative to the remainder of the genome, a difference that may be the result of intense selective pressure on male fertility. Four populations of common chimpanzees have undergone extended periods of isolation and appear to be in the early process of speciation. A recent study found amplicons enriched for testis-expressed genes on the primate X-chromosome the target of hard selective sweeps, and male-fertility genes on the Y-chromosome may also be the targets of selection.  However, little is understood about Y-chromosome amplicon diversity within and across chimpanzee populations.  Here, we analyze 9 common chimpanzee (representing three subspecies: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan troglodytes ellioti, and Pan troglodytes verus) and two bonobo (Pan paniscus) male whole-genome sequences to assess Y ampliconic copy-number diversity across the Pan genus.  We observe that the copy-number of Y chromosome amplicons is variable amongst chimpanzees and bonobos, and identify several lineage-specific patterns, including variable copy-number of azoospermia candidates RBMY and DAZ.

The modulation of chromatin accessibility is one of the key mediators of transcriptional regulation and variation in chromatin accessibility across individuals has been liked to complex traits and disease susceptibility. While mechanisms responsible for chromatin variation across individuals have been investigated, the overwhelming majority of chromatin variation remains unexplained. Furthermore, the processes through which the variation of chromatin accessibility contributes to phenotypic diversity remain poorly understood.
Results: We profiled chromatin accessibility in liver from seven strains of mice with phenotypic diversity in response to a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet and identified reproducible chromatin variation across the genome. We found that sites of variable chromatin accessibility were more likely to coincide with particular classes of transposable elements (TEs) than sites with common chromatin features. Evolutionarily younger long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are particularly enriched for variable chromatin sites. These younger LINEs are enriched for binding sites of immune-associated transcription factors, whereas older LINEs are enriched for liver-specific transcription factors. Genomic region enrichment analysis indicates that variable chromatin sites at TEs contribute to liver metabolic pathways. Finally, we show that polymorphism of TEs and differential DNA methylation at TEs can both contribute to chromatin variation.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate specific classes of TEs contribute to chromatin accessibility variation across strains of mice that display phenotypic diversity in response to a HF/HS diet. These results indicate that regulatory variation at TEs is an important contributor to phenotypic variation among populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Epigenetics & Chromatin/Epigenetics & Chromatin2.pdf,"[( 10 May 2016 , 5), ( 11 May 2016 , 2), ( 12 May 2016 , 1)]"

Here we report a suite of MeSH packages for chicken in Bioconductor and illustrate some features of different MeSH-based analyses, including MeSH-informed enrichment analysis and MeSH-guided semantic similarity among terms and gene products, using two lists of chicken genes available in public repositories. The two published datasets that were employed represent (i) differentially expressed genes and (ii) candidate genes under selective sweep or epistatic selection. The comparison of MeSH with GO overrepresentation analyses suggested not only that MeSH supports the findings obtained from GO analysis but also that MeSH is able to further enrich the representation of biological knowledge and often provide more interpretable results. Based on the hierarchical structures of MeSH and GO, we computed semantic similarities among vocabularies as well as semantic similarities among selected genes. These yielded the similarity levels between significant functional terms, and the annotation of each gene yielded the measures of gene similarity. Our findings show the benefits of using MeSH as an alternative choice of annotation in order to draw biological inferences from a list of genes of interest.

Recent work also suggests that immune priming is a costly response. Thus, depending on host and pathogen ecology and evolutionary history, tradeoffs with other fitness components may constrain the evolution of priming. However, the relative impacts of priming at different life stages and across natural populations remain unknown. We quantified immune priming responses of 10 natural populations of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, primed and infected with the natural insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. We found that priming responses were highly variable both across life stages and populations, ranging from no detectable response to a 13-fold survival benefit. Comparing across stages, we found that ontogenic immune priming at the larval stage conferred maximum protection against infection. Finally, we found that various forms of priming showed sex-specific associations that may represent tradeoffs or shared mechanisms. These results suggest that sex-, life stage-, and pathogen- specific selective pressures can cause substantial divergence in priming responses even within a species.

In a replicated experiment using a novel approach allowing within-site comparison, we examined changes in immigration rate following the gradual removal of territorial damselfish from a limited area within a much larger patch of continuous habitat. In all sites, immigration occurred at intermediate densities but did not occur before the start of removals and only rarely as density approached zero. In the combined data and in 5 of 7 sites, the number of immigrants was a hump-shaped function of density. This is the first experimental evidence for hump-shaped, density-dependent immigration. This pattern may be more widespread than previously recognized because studies over more limited density ranges have identified positive density dependence at low densities and negative density dependence at high densities. Positive density dependence at low density can arise from limits to the number of potential immigrants and from behavioral preferences for settling near conspecifics. Negative density dependence at high density can arise from competition for resources, especially high quality territories. The potential for non-linear effects of local density on immigration needs to be recognized for robust predictions of conservation reserve function, harvest impacts, pest control, and the dynamics of fragmented populations.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE131.pdf,"[( 12 Dec 2015 , 1), ( 01 Dec 2015 , 5)]"

strategy combines the core cognitive processes commonly linked to medial temporal lobe (MTL)

During such tasks fMRI studies consistently demonstrate increases in medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity, while electrophysiological studies have emphasized the important role of theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the MTL. How MTL activity is linked to theta oscillatory EEG power, however, is unknown. Specifically, it is not known
whether increases or decreases in MTL theta power are associated with increased BOLD signal. To investigate this question we recorded EEG and fMRI while participants used the spatial Method of Loci contrasted to the Pegword Method, a similarly associative but non spatial mnemonic. Surprisingly, the more effective spatial mnemonic induced a pronounced theta power decrease in the left MTL compared to the non-spatial associative mnemonic strategy. This effect was mirrored by
BOLD signal increases in the MTL. This pattern of results suggests that theta oscillations in the MTL are negatively related to BOLD signal increases. These findings extend the well-known negative relation of alpha/beta oscillations and BOLD signals in the cortex to theta oscillations in the MTL.

Rapid developments in computer simulation promise increasingly accurate recovery of RNA's nearest neighbor (NN) free energy parameters, but these methods have not been tested in predictive trials or on non-standard nucleotides. Here, we present the first such tests through a RECCES-Rosetta (Reweighting of Energy-function Collection with Conformational Ensemble Sampling in Rosetta) framework that rigorously models conformational entropy, predicts previously unmeasured NN parameters, and estimates these values' systematic uncertainties. RECCES-Rosetta recovers the ten NN parameters for Watson-Crick stacked base pairs and thirty-two single-nucleotide dangling-end parameters with unprecedented accuracies - root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 0.28 kcal/mol and 0.41 kcal/mol, respectively. For set-aside test sets, RECCES-Rosetta gives an RMSD of 0.32 kcal/mol on eight stacked pairs involving G-U wobble pairs and an RMSD of 0.99 kcal/mol on seven stacked pairs involving non-standard isocytidine-isoguanosine pairs. To more rigorously assess RECCES-Rosetta, we carried out four blind predictions for stacked pairs involving 2,6-diaminopurine-U pairs, which achieved 0.64 kcal/mol RMSD accuracy when tested by subsequent experiments. Overall, these results establish that computational methods can now blindly predict energetics of basic RNA motifs, including chemically modified variants, with consistently better than 1 kcal/mol accuracy.

Here, we reveal a collective mechanism of confinement, which we call self- driven jamming, that promotes the build-up of large me- chanical pressures in microbial populations. Microfluidic experiments on budding yeast populations in space-limited environments show that self-driven jamming arises from the gradual formation and sudden collapse of force chains driven by microbial proliferation, extending the framework of driven granular matter. The resulting contact pressures can become large enough to slow down cell growth by delaying the cell cycle in the G1 phase and to strain or even destroy the microenvironment through crack propagation.

There is a need to accelerate collection efforts in these regions before threatened or endangered species become extinct. The diverse geographical, ecological, genetic, morphological, and behavioral data generated from the on-site collection of an individual specimen are useful for many scientific purposes. However, traditional methods for specimen preparation in the field do not permit researchers to retrieve neuroanatomical data, disregarding potentially useful data for increasing our understanding of brain diversity. These data have helped clarify brain evolution, deciphered relationships between structure and function, and revealed constraints and selective pressures that provide context about the evolution of complex behavior. Here, we report our field-testing of two commonly used laboratory-based techniques for brain preservation while on a collecting expedition in the Congo Basin and Albertine Rift, two poorly known regions associated with the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. 
First, we found that transcardial perfusion fixation and long-term brain storage, conducted in remote field conditions with no access to cold storage laboratory equipment, had no observable impact on cytoarchitectural features of lizard brain tissue when compared to lizard brain tissue processed under laboratory conditions. Second, field-perfused brain tissue subjected to prolonged post-fixation remained readily compatible with subsequent immunohistochemical detection of neural antigens, with immunostaining that was comparable to that of laboratory-perfused brain tissue. Third, immersion-fixation of lizard brains, prepared under identical environmental conditions, was readily compatible with subsequent iodine-enhanced X-ray microcomputed tomography, which facilitated the non-destructive imaging of the intact brain within its skull. 
In summary, we have validated multiple approaches to preserving intact lizard brains in remote field conditions with limited access to supplies and a high degree of environmental exposure. This protocol should serve as a malleable framework for researchers attempting to rescue perishable and irreplaceable morphological and molecular data from regions of disappearing biodiversity. Our approach can be harnessed to extend the numbers of species being actively studied by the neuroscience community, by reducing some of the difficulty associated with acquiring brains of animal species that are not readily available in captivity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE132.pdf,"[( 11 May 2016 , 4)]"

The method also considers the extensive temporal and geographic heterogeneity commonly found in aDNA datasets. We compare our spatially-explicit approach to the previous non-spatial method and show that it is more conservative and thus suitable for testing population continuity, especially when small, isolated populations, such as prehistoric ones, are considered. Moreover, our approach also allows investigating partial population continuity and we apply it to a real dataset of ancient mitochondrial DNA.

However, Becquet and Przeworski (2009) report that the parameter estimates obtained by fitting the IM model are very sensitive to the model's assumptions (including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present). This paper is concerned with the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model of Wilkinson-Herbots (2012), which drops precisely this assumption. In the IIM model, one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations, between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period of isolation. We derive a very fast method of fitting an extended version of the IIM model, which also allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal population sizes. This is a maximum-likelihood method, applicable to data on the number of segregating sites between pairs of DNA sequences from a large number of independent loci. In addition to obtaining parameter estimates, our method can also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different evolutionary scenarios, by means of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the procedure on pairs of Drosophila sequences from approximately 30,000 loci. The computing time needed to fit the most complex version of the model to this data set is only a couple of minutes.

We employed theory and experiments to investigate how ecological antagonism influences social dynamics and resistance evolution in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We subjected two clones of bacterium to four doses of antibiotics and assessed growth and frequencies of public goods producing and non-producing genotypes.

Moreover, the dominance of non-producers in mixed cultures was associated with higher survival and resistance to antibiotics than in either producer or non-producer monocultures.

I show that a sympatric three-species radiation on San Salvador Island, Bahamas diversified 1,445 times faster than neighboring islands in jaw length due to evolution of a novel scale-eating adaptive zone from a generalist ancestral niche. I then sampled 22 generalist populations on seven neighboring islands and measured morphological diversity, stomach content diversity, dietary isotopic diversity, genetic diversity, lake/island areas, macroalgae richness, and Caribbean-wide patterns of gene flow. None of these standard metrics of ecological opportunity or gene flow were associated with adaptive radiation, except for slight increases in macroalgae richness. Thus, exceptional trophic diversification is highly localized despite myriad generalist populations in comparable environmental and genetic backgrounds.

Surprisingly, fundamental ecological factors, specifically competition for limited resources and resource variance, are frequently ignored in models of animal sociality. We here develop a mathematical model that includes density-dependent population growth and quantify the influence of cooperative foraging on resource use efficiency. We derive optimal resource sharing strategies, ranging from egalitarian to cooperatively breeding and eusocial groups. We find that, while egalitarian resource sharing is a risk-reducing foraging strategy, eusociality yields additional benefits: like egalitarian strategies, eusocial groups can reduce their members' starvation risk by reducing resource variance. Additionally, eusocial groups increase their reproductive output by increasing intra-group variance in resources allocated to reproduction. This allows reproduction even when resources are so scarce that solitary animals would not be able to reproduce. In a majority of environmental situations and life-histories, this twofold benefit of eusociality increased resource use efficiency and led to supersaturation, that is, to a strong increase in carrying capacity. Supersaturation provides indirect benefits to group members even for low intra-group relatedness and represents one potential explanation for the evolution and maintenance of eusociality and cooperative breeding.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1505.pdf,"[( 12 May 2016 , 2), ( 13 May 2016 , 1)]"

To diversify the set of tools available for wheat genome engineering, we have established a tRNA-based multiplex gene editing strategy for hexaploid wheat.
Results: The functionality of the various CRISPR/Cas9 components was assessed using the transient expression in the wheat protoplasts followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the targeted genomic regions. The efficiency of wheat codon-optimized Cas9 for targeted gene editing in wheat was validated. Multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were evaluated for the ability to edit the homoeologous copies of four genes affecting some important agronomic traits in wheat. Low correspondence was found between the gRNA efficiency predicted bioinformatically and that assessed in the transient expression assay. A multiplex gene editing construct with several gRNA-tRNA units under the control of a single promoter for the RNA polymerase III generated indels at the targets sites with the efficiency comparable to that obtained for a single gRNA construct.
Conclusions:  By integrating the protoplast transformation assay with multiplexed NGS, it is possible to perform fast functional screens for a large number of gRNAs and to optimize constructs for effective editing of multiple independent targets in the wheat genome. The multiplexing capacity of the tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA construct is well suited for the simultaneous editing of the redundant gene copies in the allopolyploid genomes or genomic regions beneficially affecting multiple agronomic traits.

Harnessing this ""microbial organ"" for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the stability of specific lineages. To address this we combined bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within the vertebrate gut. We observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment produced distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Consequently, one species dominates while the other experiences dramatic collapses that are well fit by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that bacterial competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to mutation in the Hirschsprung disease locus ret. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and stochastic perturbation of communities along with bacterial competition drives population dynamics within the gut. In addition, this work highlights the capacity of the enteric nervous system to affect stability of gut microbiota constituents, demonstrating that the ""gut-brain axis"" is bidirectional.

This signal initiates expression of transcription factors that will later be used to pattern the legs. The paralogous genes disconnected and disco-related encode transcription factors that are expressed in the disc primordia during early embryogenesis, and their expression continues in the leg discs during larval and pupal stages. The importance of these two genes in establishing the leg development trajectory was indicated by our previous observation that ectopic expression of either gene in the wing discs cells caused legs to develop in place of wings. However, because of their redundancy and requirement for survival during embryogenesis, we were unable to define their role in development of the adult legs. Here, we report loss-of-function analyses of the disco genes during development of the legs. We discovered that loss of both genes functions causes both truncation of the distal leg with apparent overgrowth of proximal regions and complete loss of legs and ventral thoracic body patterning. At the molecular level we noted reduction or loss of signaling and transcription factors that pattern the proximal-distal axis of the legs.

In a recent study, high-density cross-linking/mass spectrometry data in combination with ab initio structure prediction by conformational space search determined the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, with an RMSD to X-ray structure of up to 2.53 Å, or 3.38 Å in the context of blood serum. This paper reports the blind test on the readiness of this technology through the help of Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). We identified between 201-381 unique residue pairs at an estimated 5% FDR (at link level albeit with missing site assignment precision evaluation), for the four proteins that we provided data for. This equates to between 0.63-1.20 proximal residues per residue, which is comparable to that obtained in the HSA study (0.85 links per residue at 5% FDR). Nevertheless, initial results of CASP11 have suggested that improvements in structure prediction using cross-link data are slight. Most significantly, however, CASP11 revealed to us some of the current limitations of cross-linking, spelling out areas in which the method must develop in future: links spread unevenly over sequence and beta sheets both lacked links and suffered from weak definition of observed links over structure. With CASP12 taking place this year and biannually in the future, blind testing low-resolution structure analysis tools is a worthwhile and feasible undertaking.

Historically, it has been hypothesized that a population may carry many mildly deleterious variants as segregating variation, which reduces the mean absolute fitness of the population. Recent advances in sequencing technology and sequence conservation-based metrics for inferring the functional effect of a variant permit examination of the persistence of deleterious variants in populations. The issue of segregating deleterious variation is particularly important for crop improvement, because the demographic history of domestication and breeding allows deleterious variants to persist and reach moderate frequency, potentially reducing crop productivity. In this study, we use exome resequencing of fifteen barley accessions and genome resequencing of eight soybean accessions to investigate the prevalence of deleterious SNPs in the protein-coding regions of the genomes of two crops. We conclude that individual cultivars carry hundreds of deleterious SNPs on average, and that nonsense variants make up a minority of deleterious SNPs. Our approach annotates known phenotype-altering variants as deleterious more frequently than the genome-wide average, suggesting that putatively deleterious variants are likely to affect phenotypic variation.

However, the very high error rates of both technologies (around 15%-20%) makes assembly computationally expensive and imprecise at repeats longer than the read length. Here we show that the efficiency and quality of the assembly of these noisy reads can be significantly improved at a minimal cost, by leveraging on the low error rate and low cost of Illumina short reads. Namely, k-mers from the PacBio raw reads that are not present in the Illumina reads (which account for ~95% of the distinct k-mers) are deemed as sequencing errors and ignored at the seed alignment step. By focusing on ~5% of the k-mers which are error-free, read overlap sensitivity is dramatically increased. Equally important, the validation procedure can be extended to exclude repetitive k-mers, which avoids read miscorrection at repeats and further improve the resulting assemblies. We tested the k-mer validation procedure in one long-read technology (PacBio) and one assembler (MHAP/ Celera Assembler), but is likely to yield analogous improvements with alternative long-read technologies and overlappers, such as Oxford Nanopore and BLASR/DAligner.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genome Research/Genome Research40.pdf,"[( 19 May 2016 , 6), ( 21 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 17 May 2016 , 1), ( 10 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 14 May 2016 , 10), ( 27 May 2016 , 1), ( 15 May 2016 , 4), ( 18 May 2016 , 10), ( 16 May 2016 , 2), ( 20 May 2016 , 1)]"

These model monolayers are grown in the absence of any supporting structures removing cell-substrate effects. This method's potential was evaluated by observing and quantifying the generation and release of internal stresses upon actomyosin contraction (320±50Pa) and relaxation (190±40Pa) in response to chemical treatments. Although unsupported monolayers exhibited clear major and minor strain axes, they were not correlated to nuclear alignment as observed when the monolayers were grown on soft deformable gels. It was also observed that both gels and glass substrates led to the promotion of long-range cell nuclei alignment not seen in the hanging drop model.

This ratio is influenced by parameters that include the 2H/1H of water in the microbial growth environment, and biosynthetic fractionations between water and lipid. In some microbes, this biosynthetic fractionation has been shown to vary systematically with central energy metabolism, and controls on fatty acid 2H/1H may be linked to the intracellular production of NADPH. We examined the apparent fractionation between media water and the fatty acids produced by Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. Growth was in batch culture with malate as an electron donor for sulfate respiration, and with pyruvate and fumarate as substrates for fermentation and for sulfate respiration. A larger fractionation was observed as a consequence of respiratory or fermentative growth on pyruvate than growth on fumarate or malate. This difference correlates with opposite apparent flows of electrons through the electron bifurcating/confurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB. When grown on malate or fumarate, mutant strains of D. alaskensis G20 containing transposon disruptions in a copy of nfnAB show different fractionations than the wild type strain. This phenotype is muted during fermentative growth on pyruvate, and it is absent when pyruvate is a substrate for sulfate reduction. All strains and conditions produced similar fatty acid profiles, and the 2H/1H of individual lipids changed in concert with the mass-weighted average. Unsaturated fatty acids were generally depleted in 2H relative to their saturated homologues, and anteiso- branched fatty acids were generally depleted in 2H relative to straight-chain fatty acids. Fractionation correlated with growth rate, a pattern that has also been observed in the fractionation of sulfur isotopes during dissimilatory sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Frontiers in Microbiology/Frontiers in Microbiology10.pdf,"[( 19 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 17 Feb 2016 , 2)]"

We observe a trans genetic correlation of 0 for all genes except a few which show correlation between fat and skin expression.

Although recent time-lapse microscopy data provide the unparalleled ability to monitor Nanog expression at the single-cell level, the extraction of mechanistic knowledge is precluded by the lack of inference techniques suitable for noisy, incomplete and heterogeneous data obtained from proliferating cell populations. 

This work identifies Nanogs autoregulatory motif from quantified time-lapse fluorescence lineage trees with STILT (Stochastic Inference on Lineage Trees), a novel particle-filter based algorithm for exact Bayesian parameter inference and model selection of stochastic models. We first verify STILTs ability to accurately infer parameters and select the correct autoregulatory motif from simulated data. We then apply STILT to time-lapse microscopy movies of a fluorescent Nanog fusion protein reporter and reject the possibility of positive autoregulation. Finally, we use STILT for experimental design, perform in silico overexpression simulations, and experimentally validate model predictions via exogenous Nanog overexpression. We finally conclude that the protein expression dynamics and overexpression experiments strongly suggest a weak negative feedback from the protein on the DNA activation rate. 

We find that a simple autoregulatory mechanism can explain the observed heterogeneous Nanog dynamics. This finding has implications on the understanding of the core pluripotency network, such as supporting the ability of mESC populations to diversify their proteomic profile to respond to a spectrum of differentiation cues.

Currently, studies of common disease are rapidly shifting towards the use of sequencing technologies. As the cost of sequencing drops, assembling large samples in global populations is becoming increasingly feasible. Sequencing studies interrogate not only common variants, as was true for genotyping-based GWAS, but variation across the full allele frequency spectrum, yielding many more (independent) statistical tests. We sought to empirically determine genome-wide significance for various analysis scenarios. Using whole-genome sequence data, we simulated sequencing-based disease studies of varying sample size and ancestry. We determined that future sequencing efforts in > 2,000 samples should practically employ a genome-wide significance threshold of of p < 5 x 10-9, though the threshold does vary with ancestry. Studies of European or East Asian ancestry should set genome-wide significance at approximately p < 5 x 10-9, but similar studies of African or South Asian samples should be more stringent (p < 1 x 10-9).

Gastruloids, highly reproducible embryonic organoids formed from aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, display symmetry-breaking, polarised gene expression and axial development, mirroring the processes on a time-scale similar to that of the mouse embyro. Using Gastruloids formed from mouse ESCs containing reporters for Wnt, FGF and Nodal signalling, we were able to quantitatively assess the contribution of these signalling pathways to the establishment of asymmetry through single time-point and live-cell fluorescence microscopy.
During the first 24-48h of culture, interactions between the Wnt/β-Catenin and Nodal/TGFβ signalling pathways promote the initial symmetry-breaking event, manifested through polarised Brachyury (T/Bra) expression. Neither BMP nor FGF signalling is required for the establishment of asymmetry, however Wnt signalling is essential for the amplification and stability of the initial patterning event. Additionally, low, endogenous levels of FGF (24-48h) has a role in the amplification of the established pattern at later time-points.
Our results confirm that Gastruloids behave like epiblast cells in the embryo, leading us to translate the processes and signalling involved in pattern formation of Gastruloids in culture to the development of the embryo, firmly establishing Gastruloids as a highly reproducible, robust model system for studying cell fate decisions and early pattern formation in culture.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1521.pdf,"[( 06 Aug 2016 , 4), ( 06 May 2016 , 8), ( 25 Nov 2016 , 3), ( 14 Oct 2016 , 2), ( 07 Aug 2016 , 4), ( 13 May 2016 , 2), ( 14 May 2016 , 2), ( 27 May 2016 , 1), ( 02 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 26 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 28 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 01 Nov 2016 , 3), ( 05 May 2016 , 7), ( 07 May 2016 , 1), ( 05 Feb 2017 , 1)]"

In recent work, we have suggested a direct and primary role for bacterial lipopolysaccharide in this hypercoagulability, but it seems never to have been tested directly. Here we show that the addition of tiny concentrations (0.2 ng.L-1) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to both whole blood and platelet-poor plasma of normal, healthy donors leads to marked changes in the nature of the fibrin fibres so formed, as observed by ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopy (the latter implying that the fibrin is actually in an amyloid β-sheet-rich form.  They resemble those seen in a number of inflammatory (and also amyloid) diseases, consistent with an involvement of LPS in their aetiology. These changes are mirrored by changes in their viscoelastic properties as measured by thromboelastography. Since the terminal stages of coagulation involve the polymerisation of fibrinogen into fibrin fibres, we tested whether LPS would bind to fibrinogen directly. We demonstrated this using isothermal calorimetry.  Finally, we show that these changes in fibre structure are mirrored when the experiment is done simply with purified fibrinogen and thrombin (± 0.2 ng.L-1 LPS). This ratio of concentrations of LPS:fibrinogen in vivo represents a molecular amplification by the LPS of more than 108-fold, a number that is probably unparalleled in biology.

Due to their sheer size, these jackpot events, first discovered by Luria and Delbrueck, are thought to have momentous roles in short-term evolutionary processes, including the adaptation from standing variation, evolutionary rescue, drug resistance evolution, and the somatic evolution of genetic diseases. However, because the emergence of jackpot events has been understood only in uniformly growing populations, it is currently impossible to predict their impact on the evolution of many naturally structured populations. To study jackpot events in spatially structured populations, we tracked mutant clones in microbial populations using fluorescent microscopy and population sequencing. High-frequency mutations were massively enriched in microbial colonies compared to well-shaken liquid cultures, as a result of late-occurring mutations surfing at the edge of range expansions. We provide a mathematical theory that explains the observed excess of jackpot events and predicts their role in promoting rare evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we show that resistant clones generated by surfing can become unleashed under high selection pressures, and thus represent a drug resistance hazard for high-dose drug treatments. An excess of mutational jackpot events is shown to be a general consequence of non-uniform growth and, therefore, could be relevant to the mutational load of developing biofilm communities, solid tumors and multi-cellular organisms.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1524.pdf,"[( 16 May 2016 , 7), ( 17 May 2016 , 3)]"

A systematic screen for type-III effector proteins from Pst  for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1 and HopG1 as candidates. Identification of proteins interacting with HopM1 by mass-spectrometry indicate that HopM1 resides in a complex together with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits, supporting the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome leading to its inhibition.

We found that about half of the neurons were border-ownership selective for contours in natural scenes and this selectivity originated from the image context.

This observation holds even when the analysis is restricted to sympatric sister pairs known to hybridize, and which have divergence times estimated similar to allopatric pairs. Inversions were significantly more likely to have fixed on a sex chromosome than an autosome yet variable mutagenic input alone (by chromosome size, map length, GC content, or repeat density) cannot explain the differences between chromosomes in the number of inversions fixed.

Our analyses of BRZ/BEH gene mutants and mutant combinations revealed that functional redundancy among gene family members does not contribute to trait robustness. Connectivity is another commonly cited determinant of robustness; however, we found no correlation between connectivity among gene family members or their connectivity with other transcription factors and effects on robustness. Instead, we found that only BEH4, the most ancient family member, modulated developmental robustness. We present evidence that regulatory cross-talk among gene family members is integrated by BEH4 and promotes wild-type levels of developmental robustness. Further, the chaperone HSP90, a known determinant of developmental robustness, appears to act via BEH4 in maintaining robustness of embryonic stem length.

We investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the excitability type of dopamine (DA) neurons, using a conductance based biophysical model, and its regulation by intrinsic and synaptic currents. By calibrating the model to reproduce low frequency tonic firing, NMDA excitation is balanced by GABA-mediated inhibition and leads to type I excitable behavior characterized by a continuous decrease in firing frequency in response to hyperpolarizing currents. Furthermore, we analyzed how excitability type of the DA neuron model is influenced by changes in the intrinsic current composition. A subthreshold sodium current is necessary for a continuous frequency decrease during application of a negative current, and the low-frequency balanced state during simultaneous activation of NMDA and GABA receptors. Blocking this current switches the neuron to type II. Enhancing the anomalous rectifier Ih current also switches the excitability to type II. Key characteristics of synaptic conductances that may be observed in vivo also change the type of excitability: a depolarized GABAR reversal potential or co-activation of AMPARs leads to an abrupt frequency drop to zero, which is typical for type II excitability. Coactivation of NMDARs together with AMPARs and GABARs shifts the the type I/II boundary toward more hyperpolarized GABAR reversal potentials. To better understand how altering each of the aforementioned currents leads to changes in excitability profile of DA neuron, we provide a thorough dynamical analysis. Collectively, these results imply that type I excitability in dopamine neurons might be important for low firing rates and fine-tuning basal dopamine levels, while switching excitability to type II during NMDAR and AMPAR activation may facilitate a transient increase in dopamine concentration, as type II neurons are more amenable to synchronization.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS Computational Biology/PLOS Computational Biology63.pdf,"[( 17 May 2016 , 2)]"

Here, we used a publically available R-fMRI dataset, in which 30 healthy participants were scanned 10 times (10 minutes per session), to investigate differences in full-brain transition profiles (i.e., gradient maps, edge maps) across individuals, and their reliability. 10-minute R-fMRI scans were sufficient to achieve high accuracies in efforts to 'fingerprint' individuals based upon full-brain transition profiles. Regarding test-retest reliability, the image-wise intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was moderate, and vertex-level ICC varied depending on region; larger durations of data yielded higher reliability scores universally. Initial application of gradient-based methodologies to a recently published dataset obtained from twins suggested inter-individual variation in areal profiles might have genetic and familial origins.

The N-terminal lid region of MDM2 modulates interactions with p53 via competition for its binding cleft, exchanging slowly between docked and undocked conformations in the absence of p53. To better understand these dynamics, we constructed Markov State Models (MSMs) from large collections of unbiased simulation trajectories of apo-MDM2, and find strong evidence for diffuse, yet two-state folding and binding of the N-terminal region to the p53 receptor site. The MSM also identifies holo-like receptor conformations highly suitable for computational docking, despite initiating trajectories from closed-cleft receptor structures unsuitable for docking.  Fixed-anchor docking studies using a test set of high-affinity small molecules and peptides show simulated receptor ensembles achieve docking successes comparable to cross-docking studies using crystal structures of receptors bound by alternative ligands. For p53, the best-scoring receptor structures have the N-terminal region lid region bound in a helical conformation mimicking the bound structure of p53, suggesting lid region association induces receptor conformations suitable for binding. These results suggest that MD+MSM approaches can sample binding-competent receptor conformations suitable for computational peptidomimetic design, and that inclusion of disordered regions may be essential to capturing the correct receptor dynamics.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Scientific Reports/Scientific Reports81.pdf,"[( 17 May 2016 , 2), ( 27 May 2016 , 1)]"

The existing methods for detecting recombination are primarily aimed at viral genomes or sets of loci, since the expensive computation of underlying statistical models often hinders the comparison of complete prokaryotic genomes. As an alternative, alignment-free solutions are more efficient, but cannot map (align) a query to subject genomes. To address this problem, we have developed gmos (Genome MOsaic Structure), a new program that determines the mosaic structure of query genomes when compared to a set of closely related subject genomes. The program first computes local alignments between query and subject genomes and then reconstructs the query mosaic structure by choosing the best local alignment for each query region. To accomplish the analysis quickly, the program mostly relies on pairwise alignments and constructs multiple sequence alignments over short overlapping subject regions only when necessary. This fine-tuned implementation achieves an efficiency comparable to an alignment-free tool. The program performs well for simulated and real data sets of closely related genomes and can be used for fast recombination detection; for instance, when a new prokaryotic pathogen is discovered. As an example, gmos was used to detect genome mosaicism in a pathogenic Enterococcus faecium strain compared to seven closely related genomes. The analysis took less than two minutes on a single 2.1 GHz processor. The output is available in fasta format and can be visualized using an accessory program, gmosDraw (freely available with gmos).",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE134.pdf,"[( 24 May 2016 , 3), ( 17 May 2016 , 8)]"

Evaluating gene networks with respect to known biology is a common task but often a computationally costly one.  Many computational experiments are difficult to apply exhaustively in network analysis due to run-times. To permit high-throughput analysis of gene networks, we have implemented a set of very efficient tools to calculate functional properties in networks based on guilt-by-association methods. EGAD (Extending 'Guilt-by-Association' by Degree) allows gene networks to be evaluated with respect to hundreds or thousands of gene sets. The methods predict novel members of gene groups, assess how well a gene network groups known sets of genes, and determines the degree to which generic predictions drive performance. By allowing fast evaluations, whether of random sets or real functional ones, EGAD provides the user with an assessment of performance which can easily be used in controlled evaluations across many parameters.

However, it is not clear whether the network of metabolic reactions expressed by cancers of different origin differ from each other nor from normal human tissues. In this study, we reconstructed functional and connected genome-scale metabolic models for 917 primary tumors based on the probability of expression for 3,765 reference metabolic genes in the sample. This network-centric approach revealed that tumor metabolic networks are largely similar in terms of accounted reactions, despite diversity in the expression of the associated genes. On average, each network contained 4,721 reactions, of which 74% were core reactions (present in >95% of all models). Whilst 99.3% of the core reactions were classified as housekeeping also in normal tissues, we identified reactions catalyzed by ARG2, RHAG, SLC6 and SLC16 family gene members, and PTGS1 and PTGS2 as core exclusively in cancer. The remaining 26% of the reactions were contextual reactions. Their inclusion was dependent in one case (GLS2) on the absence of TP53 mutations and in 94.6% of cases on differences in cancer types. This dependency largely resembled differences in expression patterns in the corresponding normal tissues, with some exceptions like the presence of the NANP-encoded reaction in tumors not from the female reproductive system or of the SLC5A9-encoded reaction in kidney-pancreatic-colorectal tumors. In conclusion, tumors expressed a metabolic network virtually overlapping the matched normal tissues, raising the possibility that metabolic reprogramming simply reflects cancer cell plasticity to adapt to varying conditions thanks to redundancy and complexity of the underlying metabolic networks.

Until recently model selection remains an explored topic and the impacts of using different models on inferring biogeographic history are poorly understood. Focusing on the Neotropical weevils in the Exophthalmus genus complex (Insecta: Curculionidae: Entiminae), we compare three commonly used biogeographic models - DIVA (Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis), DEC (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis) and BayArea (Bayesian Analysis of Biogeography), and examine the impact of modeling founder-event jump dispersal on biogeographic history estimation. We also investigate the biogeographic events that have shaped patterns of distributions, diversification, and endemism in this group of weevils. We sample representatives of 65 species of the Exophthalmus genus complex and 26 outgroup terminals from the Neotropics including Caribbean islands and mainland. We reconstruct a molecular phylogeny based on six genes and performed molecular dating using a relaxed clock with three fossil calibration points. We conduct biogeographic history estimations and compare alternative biogeographic models with the R package BioGeoBEARS. Model selection strongly favors biogeographic models that include founder-event jump dispersal. Without modeling jump dispersal, estimations based on the three biogeographic models are dramatically different, especially at early diverging nodes. When jump dispersal is modeled, however, the three biogeographic models perform similarly. Accordingly, we show that the Neotropical mainland was colonized by Caribbean species in the early Miocene, and that in situ diversification accounts for a majority (~75%) of the biogeographic events in the Exophthalmus genus complex. Our study highlights the need for testing for wide-ranging historical biogeographic processes in the study of Caribbean biogeography and the importance of comparing and selecting the best-fitting model in statistical biogeographic inferences. We demonstrate that modeling founder-event jump dispersal significantly improves the fit of the biogeographic history estimation of Caribbean and Neotropical mainland weevils. We establish that in situ diversification acts as a dominant biogeographic force in the evolution of the Exophthalmus genus complex.

These methods belong to a broad class of mixed-membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation used to analyze text corpora. Inference from mixed-membership models can produce different output matrices when repeatedly applied to the same inputs, and the number of latent clusters is a parameter that is often varied in the analysis pipeline. For these reasons, quantifying, visualizing, and annotating the output from mixed-membership models are bottlenecks for investigators across multiple disciplines from ecology to text data mining.
Results: We introduce pong, a network-graphical approach for analyzing and visualizing membership in latent clusters with a native D3.js interactive visualization. pong leverages efficient algorithms for solving the Assignment Problem to dramatically reduce runtime while increasing accuracy compared to other methods that process output from mixed-membership models. We apply pong to 225,705 unlinked genome-wide single-nucleotide variants from 2,426 unrelated individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project, and identify previously overlooked aspects of global human population structure. We show that pong outpaces current solutions by more than an order of magnitude in runtime while providing a customizable and interactive visualization of population structure that is more accurate than those produced by current tools.

A first step in this process is to generate mappings between the elements of these different sources. There are a number of well-known techniques for generating mappings, both manual and automatic. Sometimes mappings are seen as an end in themselves, with the sources remaining in a loosely connected state. However, if we want to take the next step and use the mappings to weave together the different sources into a cohesive reference ontology, then we need to translate the mappings into precise logical relationships. This will allow us to safely merge equivalent concepts, creating a unified ontology. This translation is a non-trivial step, as each mapping can be interpreted as multiple different logical relationships, with each interpretation affecting the likelihood of the others. There is a lack of automated methods to assist with this last step; this resolution is typically performed by expert ontologists.
Here we describe an ontology construction technique that takes two or more ontologies linked by hypothetical axioms, and estimates the most likely unified logical ontology. Hypothetical axioms can themselves be derived from semantically loose mappings. The method combines deductive reasoning and probabilistic inference and is called Bayesian OWL Ontology Merging (BOOM). We describe a special form k-BOOM that works by factorizing the probabilistic ontology into k submodules. We also briefly describe a supplemental lexical and knowledge-based technique for generating a set of hypothetical axioms from loose mappings.
We are currently using this technique to build a merged disease ontology (Monarch Disease Ontology; MonDO) that unifies a broad range of vocabularies into a consistent and coherent whole.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1536.pdf,"[( 04 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 02 May 2016 , 1), ( 09 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 11 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 15 Apr 2016 , 6), ( 18 May 2016 , 2), ( 02 Aug 2016 , 1)]"

Biological networks play an increasingly important role in the
exploration of  functional modularity and  cellular organization at a
systemic level. Quite often the first tools used to analyze these
networks are  clustering algorithms. We concentrate here
on the specific task of predicting protein complexes (PC) in large protein-protein
interaction networks (PPIN).
Currently, many state-of-the-art algorithms work well for networks of small or moderate size.
However, their  performance on much larger networks, which are becoming increasingly common in modern proteome-wise studies, needs to be re-assessed.
Our aim is to push forward the state-of the-art in PPIN clustering providing an algorithmic
solution with polynomial running time  that attains
experimentally demonstrable good output quality and speed on challenging large real networks.

Results.
We present a new fast algorithm for clustering large sparse
networks:  Core&Peel, which runs essentially in time and storage
O(a(G)m+n) for a network G of n nodes and m arcs, where
a(G) is the  arboricity of G (which is roughly
proportional to the maximum average degree of any induced subgraph
in G). We evaluated  Core&Peel on five PPI networks of large
size and one of medium size from both yeast and homo sapiens, comparing its
performance against those of  ten state-of-the-art methods. We
demonstrate  that  Core&Peel consistently outperforms the ten
competitors in its ability to identify known protein complexes and
in the functional coherence of its predictions. Our method is
remarkably robust, being quite insensible to the injection of random interactions.
Core&Peel is also empirically efficient attaining the second
best running time over large networks among the tested algorithms.

Five samples contained significant numbers of RVA Illumina reads, sufficient to obtain their (near) complete genomes.

Mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics experiments rely on accurate matching of experimental spectra against a database of protein sequences. Existing computational analysis methods are limited in the size of their sequence databases, which severely restricts the proteomic sequencing depth and functional analysis of highly complex samples. The growing amount of public high-throughput sequencing
data will only exacerbate this problem. We designed a broadly applicable metaproteomic analysis method (ComPIL) that addresses protein database size limitations.

Results
Our approach to overcome this significant limitation in metaproteomics was to design a scalable set of sequence databases assembled for optimal library querying speeds. ComPIL was integrated with a modified version of the search engine ProLuCID (termed ""Blazmass"") to permit rapid matching of experimental spectra. Proof-of-principle analysis of human HEK293 lysate with a ComPIL database derived from high-quality genomic libraries was able to detect nearly all of the same peptides as a search with a human database (~500x fewer peptides in the database), with a small reduction in sensitivity. We were also able to detect proteins from the adenovirus used to immortalize these cells. We applied our method to a set of healthy human gut microbiome proteomic samples and showed a substantial increase in the number of identified peptides and proteins  compared to previous metaproteomic analyses, while retaining a high degree of protein identification accuracy, and allowing for a more in-depth characterization of the functional landscape of the samples.
Conclusions
The combination of ComPIL with Blazmass allows proteomic searches to be performed with database sizes much larger than previously possible. These large database searches can be applied to complex meta-samples with unknown composition or proteomic samples where unexpected proteins may be identified.

Moreover, no studies have examined the potential of predicting single crosses made among random progenies derived from a series of biparental families, which resembles the structure of germplasm comprising the initial stages of a hybrid maize breeding pipeline. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of genomic prediction for identifying superior single crosses early in the breeding pipeline and optimize its application. To accomplish these objectives, we designed and analyzed a novel population of single-cross hybrids representing the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic/Non-Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern commonly used in the development of North American commercial maize hybrids. The single cross prediction accuracies estimated using cross-validation ranged from 0.40 to 0.74 for grain yield, 0.68 to 0.91 for plant height and 0.54 to 0.94 for staygreen depending on the number of tested parents of the single crosses. The genomic estimated general and specific combining abilities showed a clear advantage over the use of genomic covariances among single crosses, especially when one or both parents of the single cross were untested in hybrid combinations. Overall, our results suggest that genomic prediction of the performance of single crosses made using random progenies from the early stages of the breeding pipeline holds great potential to re-design hybrid breeding and increase its efficiency.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1542.pdf,"[( 18 May 2016 , 5), ( 19 May 2016 , 2), ( 20 May 2016 , 1)]"

Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues.

Understanding how leukocytes in the cervicovaginal and colorectal mucosae respond to pathogens, and how medical interventions affect these responses, is important for developing better tools to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. An effective cryopreservation protocol for these cells following their isolation will make studying them more feasible.

Methods and findings
To find an optimal cryopreservation protocol for mucosal mononuclear leukocytes, we compared cryopreservation media and procedures using human vaginal leukocytes and confirmed our results with endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Specifically, we measured the recovery of viable vaginal T cells and macrophages after cryopreservation with different cryopreservation media and handling procedures. We found several cryopreservation media that led to recoveries above 75%. Limiting the number and volume of washes increased the fraction of cells recovered by 10-15%, possibly due to the small cell numbers in mucosal samples. We confirmed that our cryopreservation protocol also works well for both endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Cryopreserved leukocytes had slightly increased cytokine responses to antigenic stimulation relative to the same cells tested fresh. Additionally, we tested whether it is better to cryopreserve endocervical cells on the cytobrush or in suspension.

Conclusions
Leukocytes from cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues can be cryopreserved with good recovery of functional, viable cells using several different cryopreservation media. The number and volume of washes has an experimentally meaningful effect on the percentage of cells recovered. We provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol with best practices for cryopreservation of mucosal leukocytes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE135.pdf,"[( 24 Mar 2016 , 6), ( 25 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Due to associations between Zika virus infection and a range of fetal maladies, the epidemic trajectory of this viral infection poses a significant concern for the nearly 15 million children born in the Americas each year.

One recent estimate suggested that 5.42 million childbearing women live in areas of the Americas that are suitable for Zika occurrence. To improve on that estimate, which did not take into account the protective effects of herd immunity, we developed a new approach that combines classic results from epidemiological theory with seroprevalence data and highly spatially resolved data about drivers of transmission to make location-specific projections of epidemic attack rates.

We screened rough endosperm (rgh) mutants for parent-of-origin effects using reciprocal crosses with inbred parents. Six maternal rough endosperm (mre) and three paternal rough endosperm (pre) mutants were identified with three mre loci mapped. When inherited from the female parent, mre/+ seeds reduce grain-fill with a rough, etched, or pitted endosperm surface. Pollen transmission of pre mutants results in rgh endosperm as well as embryo lethality. Eight of the loci had significant distortion from the expected one-to-one ratio for parent-of-origin effects.

Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly. 

Results

We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (1) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs which permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (3) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.

 derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.

Methods
This is a proof-of-concept study, in which intraocular fluid samples were obtained from 5 subjects with known diagnoses, and one subject with bilateral chronic uveitis without a known etiology.  Samples were subjected to MDS, and results were compared with conventional diagnostic tests. Pathogens were identified using a rapid computational pipeline to analyze the non-host sequences obtained from MDS.  

Findings
Unbiased MDS of intraocular fluid produced results concordant with known diagnoses in subjects with (n=4) and without (n=1) uveitis.

MDS can identify fungi, parasites, and DNA and RNA viruses in minute volumes of intraocular fluid samples.

However, as with all computational advances, reproducibility across experiments requires attention to detail. The elegant approach of Kallisto reduces dependencies, but we noted differences in quantification between versions of Kallisto, and both upstream preparation and downstream interpretation benefit from an environment that enforces a requirement for equivalent processing when comparing groups of samples.  Therefore, we created the  \href{https://github.com/RamsinghLab/arkas}{Arkas}\cite{Colombo} and \href{https://github.com/RamsinghLab/TxDbLite}{TxDbLite}\cite{TricheJr} R packages to meet these needs and to ease cloud-scale deployment of the above.  TxDbLite extracts structured information directly from source FASTA files with per-contig metadata, while Arkas enforces versioning of the derived indices and annotations, to ensure tight coupling of inputs and outputs while minimizing external dependencies.  The two packages are combined in Illumina's BaseSpace cloud computing environment to offer a massively parallel and distributed quantification step for power users, loosely coupled to biologically informative downstream analyses via gene set analysis (with special focus on Reactome annotations for ENSEMBL transcriptomes).

Based on earlier work by \href{http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9546.full}{Bourgon et al., 2010}\cite{Bourgon}, we included this type of filtering for both gene- and transcript-level analyses within Arkas.

Clinical genomic testing is dependent on the robust identification and reporting of variant-level information in relation to disease. With the shift to high-throughput sequencing, a major challenge for clinical diagnostics is the cross-identification of variants called on their genomic position to resources that rely on transcript- or protein-based descriptions. 

Methods: 
We evaluated the accuracy of three tools (SnpEff, Variant Effect Predictor and Variation Reporter) that generate transcript and protein-based variant nomenclature from genomic coordinates according to guidelines by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Our evaluation was based on comparisons to a manually-curated list of 127 test variants of various types drawn from data sources, each with HGVS-compliant transcript and protein descriptors. We further evaluated the concordance between annotations generated by Snpeff and Variant Effect Predictor with those in major germline and cancer databases: ClinVar and COSMIC, respectively.

Results: 
We find that there is substantial discordance between the annotation tools and databases in the description of insertion and/or deletions.  Accuracy based on our ground truth set was between 80-90% for coding and 50-70% for protein variants, numbers that are not adequate for clinical reporting. Exact concordance for SNV syntax was over 99.5% between ClinVar and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and SnpEff, but less than 90% for non-SNV variants. For COSMIC, exact concordance for coding and protein SNVs were between 65 and 88%, and less than 15% for insertions. Across the tools and datasets, there was a wide range of equivalent expressions describing protein variants.

Background: 
The identification of enhancer is a challenging task. Various types of epigenetic information including histone modification have been utilized in the construction of enhancer prediction models based on a diverse panel of machine learning models. However, DNA   methylation profiles generated from the whole genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS) have not been fully explored for their potential in enhancer prediction despite the fact that low methylated regions (LMRs) have been implied to be distal active regulatory regions.

Method: 
In this work we propose a prediction framework, LMethyR-SVM, using LMRs identified from cell-type-specific WGBS DNA methylation profiles based on an unlabeled-negative learning framework. In LMethyR-SVM, the set of cell-type-specific LMRs is further divided into three sets:  reliable positive, like positive, and likely negative, according to their resemblance to a small set of experimentally validated enhancers in the VISTA database based on an estimated non-parametric density distribution. Then, the prediction model is trained by solving a weighted support vector machine.

Results:
We demonstrate the performance of LMethyR-SVM by using the WGBS DNA methylation profiles derived from the H1 human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and the fetal lung fibroblast cell type (IMR90). The predicted enhancers are highly conserved with a reasonable validation rate based on a set of commonly used positive markers including transcription factors, p300 binding and DNase-I hypersensitive sites. In addition, we show evidence that the large fraction of LMethyR-SVM predicted enhancers are not predicted by ChromHMM in H1 cell type and they are more enriched for the FANTOM5 enhancers. 

Conclusion: 
Our work suggests that low methylated regions detected from the WGBS data are useful as complementary resources to histone modification marks in developing models for the prediction of cell type-specific enhancers.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE136.pdf,"[( 19 May 2016 , 6), ( 20 May 2016 , 1)]"

We analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 and 101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding factors, we identified 1,446 protein-coding genes whose expression in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age at a false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing, amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven, suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found that the aging response of many genes, e.g., TP37 and C1QA, depends on individuals' genotypic backgrounds. Finally, using dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL7R, MS4A4E, and TERF1/TERF2 whose expressions are differentially dispersed by aging, i.e., variances differ between age groups.

We present a general framework for assignment of functional mutations to specific cancer clones, which is based on distinction between passenger variants with expected low dispersion of VAF versus putative functional variants, which may not be used for the reconstruction of cancer clonal architecture but can be assigned to inferred clones at the final stage. The key element of our framework is QuantumClone, a method to cluster variants into clones, which we have thoroughly tested on simulated data. QuantumClone takes into account VAFs and genotypes of corresponding regions together with information about normal cell contamination.

We find that 20-37% of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced. While males generally express a larger number of genes, AS is more prevalent in females, suggesting that the sexes adopt different expression strategies for their specialized function. While the number of total genes expressed increases during early embryonic development, the proportion of expressed genes that are alternatively spliced is highest in the very early embryo, before the onset of zygotic transcription. This indicates that females deposit a diversity of isoforms into the egg, consistent with abundant AS found in ovary. Cluster analysis by gene expression levels (“GE”) show mostly stage-specific clustering in embryonic samples, and tissue-specific clustering in adult tissues.

However, instead of disintegrating, ring topology recovers and constriction proceeds. In response to severing, a finite gap forms that is proportional to ring perimeters before cutting, demonstrating that tension along the ring decreases throughout constriction. Severed rings repair their gaps by recruiting new material and subsequently increase constriction rate and complete cytokinesis with the same timing as uncut rings. Rings repair successive cuts and exhibit substantial constriction when gap repair is prevented.

We found also evidence of a decrease in integration in the phenotypically intermediate, hybrid snails, consistent with hybridization resulting in a release of multivariate  variation and increased evolvability. Across the phenotypic gradient, decreases in overall integration tended to be accompanied by increases in some measures of modularity, but the latter did nor reflect high correlation structure. The increases occurred only in a proportional sense, correlations among modules tending to decrease faster than within modules for low overall integration tiers. Integration analyses based on non partial and partial correlations tended to produce contrasting results, which suggested hierarchical sources of shell integration.

In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. 

To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats received midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. 

The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats' subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. 

Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing.

Genomic prediction is arguably the greatest need for complex diseases and disorders for which both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to risk. However, we have no adequate insight of the accuracy of such predictions, and how accuracy may vary between individuals or between populations. In this study, we present a theoretical framework to demonstrate that prediction accuracy can be maximised by targeting more informative individuals in a discovery set with closer relationships with the subjects, making prediction more similar to those in populations with small effective size (Ne). Increase of prediction accuracy from closer relationships is achieved under an additive model and does not rely on any interaction effects (gene × gene, gene × environment or gene × family). Using theory, simulations and real data analyses, we show that the predictive accuracy or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased exponentially with decreasing Ne. For example, with a set of realistic parameters (the sample size of discovery set N=3000 and heritability h2=0.5), AUC value approached to 0.9 (Ne = 100) from 0.6 (Ne = 10000), and the top percentile of the estimated genetic profile scores had 23 times higher proportion of cases than the general population (with Ne = 100), which increased from 2 times higher proportion of cases (with Ne = 10000). This suggests that different interventions in the top percentile risk groups maybe justified (i.e. stratified medicine). In conclusion, it is argued that there is considerable room to increase prediction accuracy for polygenic traits by using an efficient design of a smaller Ne (e.g. a design consisting of closer relationships) so that genomic prediction can be more beneficial in clinical applications in the near future.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1551.pdf,"[( 21 May 2016 , 3), ( 20 May 2016 , 5), ( 31 May 2016 , 1)]"

Some past epidemics of different influenza (sub)types (particularly A/H3N2) in the US saw co-circulation of vaccine-type and variant strains. There is evidence that natural infection with one influenza (sub)type offers short-term protection against infection with another influenza (sub)type (henceforth, cross-immunity). This suggests that such cross-immunity for strains within a (sub)type is expected to be strong. Therefore, while vaccination effective against one strain may reduce transmission of that strain, this may also lead to a reduction of the ability of the vaccine-type strain to suppress spread of a variant strain. It remains unclear what the joint effect of vaccination and cross-immunity is for co-circulating influenza strains, and what is the potential benefit of a bivalent vaccine that protects against both strains. 
We simulated co-circulation of vaccine-type and variant strains under a variety of scenarios. In each scenario, we considered the case when the vaccine efficacy against the variant strain is lower than the efficacy against the vaccine-type strain (monovalent vaccine), as well the case when vaccine is equally efficacious against both strains (bivalent vaccine). 
Administration of a bivalent vaccine results in a significant reduction in the overall incidence of infection compared to administration of a monovalent vaccine, even with lower coverage by the bivalent vaccine. Additionally, we found that the stronger is the degree of cross-immunity, the less beneficial is the increase in coverage levels for the monovalent vaccine, and the more beneficial is the introduction of the bivalent vaccine. 
Our work exhibits the limitations of influenza vaccines that have low efficacy against non-vaccine strains, and demonstrates the benefits of vaccines that offer good protection against multiple influenza strains. The results elucidate the need for guarding against the potential co-circulation of non-vaccine strains for an influenza (sub)type, at least during select seasons, possibly through inclusion of multiple strains within a (sub)type (particularly A/H3N2) in a vaccine.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1553.pdf,"[( 21 May 2016 , 2), ( 20 May 2016 , 4)]"

We recognise, however, that extremely unusual mutations, or mechanical stressing, can cause fibrinogen to adopt a conformation containing extensive beta-sheets. Similarly, prions can change morphology from a largely alpha-helical to a largely beta-sheet conformation, and the latter catalyses both the transition and the self-organising polymerisation of the beta-sheet structures. Many other proteins can do this, where it is known as amyloidogenesis. When fibrin is formed in samples from patients harbouring different diseases it can have widely varying diameters and morphologies. We here develop the idea, and summarise the evidence, that in many cases the anomalous fibrin fibre formation seen in such diseases actually amounts to amyloidogenesis. In particular, fibrin can interact withthe amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein that is misfolded in Alzheimer's disease. Seeing these unusual fibrin morphologies as true amyloids explains a great deal about fibrin(ogen) biology that was previously opaque, and provides novel strategies for treating such coagulopathies.

To discern the true causal variant(s), a variety of statistical fine-mapping methods have been proposed to prioritize variants for functional validation.

To improve computational efficiency, we describe a new importance sampling scheme to perform model inference. First, we demonstrate in simulations that by leveraging functional annotation data, fastPAINTOR increases fine-mapping resolution relative to existing methods. Next, we show that jointly modeling pleiotropic risk regions improves fine-mapping resolution compared to standard single trait and pleiotropic fine mapping strategies.

Most current statistical tools for estimating such population demographic parameters are based on Kingman's coalescent (KC). However, KC is inappropriate for taxa displaying skewed reproductive variance, a property widely observed in natural species. Coalescent models that consider skewed reproductive success - called multiple merger coalescent (MMCs) - have been shown to substantially improve estimates of Ne when the distribution of offspring per capita is highly skewed. MMCs predictions of standard population genetic parameters, including the rate of loss of genetic variation and the fixation probability of strongly selected alleles, substantially depart from KC predictions.

While these environments are geologically diverse, potentially allowing energy harvesting by microorganisms that catalyze redox reactions, many of the abundant electron donors and acceptors are insoluble and therefore not directly bioavailable. Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a metabolic strategy that microorganisms can deploy to meet the challenges of interacting with redox-active surfaces. Though mechanistically characterized in a few metal-reducing bacteria, the role, extent, and diversity of EET in subsurface ecosystems remains unclear. Since this process can be mimicked on electrode surfaces, it opens the door to electrochemical techniques to enrich for and quantify the activities of environmental microorganisms in situ. Here, we report the electrochemical enrichment of microorganisms from a deep fractured-rock aquifer in Death Valley, California, USA. In experiments performed in mesocosms containing a synthetic medium based on aquifer chemistry, four working electrodes were poised at different redox potentials (272, 373, 472, 572 mV vs. SHE) to serve as electron acceptors, resulting in anodic currents coupled to the oxidation of acetate during enrichment. The anodes were dominated by Betaproteobacteria from the families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae. A representative of each dominant family was subsequently isolated from electrode-associated biomass. The EET abilities of the isolated Delftia strain (designated WE1-13) and Azonexus strain (designated WE2-4) were confirmed in electrochemical reactors using working electrodes poised at 522 mV vs. SHE. The rise in anodic current upon inoculation was correlated with a modest increase in total protein content. Both genera have been previously observed in mixed communities of microbial fuel cell enrichments, but this is the first direct measurement of their electrochemical activity. While alternate metabolisms (e.g. nitrate reduction) by these organisms were previously known, our observations suggest that additional 'hidden' interactions with external electron acceptors are also possible.

This enabled a detailed analysis of the dynamics and origin of proviral DNA during ART. A median of 14% (range 0-42%) of the p17gag DNA sequences were overtly defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. The remaining sequences were remarkably similar to previously observed RNA sequences and showed no evidence of evolution over many years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather, the data indicate that viral DNA variants are turning over as long as patients are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/eLife/eLife64.pdf,"[( 18 May 2016 , 7)]"

We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from all layers of isoflurane-anesthetized cat primary visual cortex (V1) while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses of single units were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, with lognormally distributed mean firing rates. Many units had distinct barcode-like firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Because the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced, our results complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. The presence of orientation maps in cat V1 may explain contrary reports in anesthetized rodents, and predicts a similar result in anesthetized ferret and primate V1.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1559.pdf,"[( 15 Nov 2015 , 2), ( 17 Feb 2016 , 1)]"

Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioural traits, have inherently non-normal distributions. The generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for non-normal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically-convenient latent scale, it is sometimes desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are expressed. The parameters of a fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal for this effect by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulae for quantities such as heritability of traits with Binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories.

Given the increasingly widespread use of DNA methylation microarrays in population-scale epidemiological applications, we sought to determine which methods provided the greatest statistical power to reproducibly detect differences in DNA methylation across various conditions, using publicly available data sets on tissue type and aging.

Beta regression, as proposed originally by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, yielded more validated hits in each of our comparisons than any other method under consideration, both in a regression setting and in comparisons to two-group tests such as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Student t, and Welch t tests.  In large cohorts of whole blood samples, we corrected for compositional differences and batch effects, and found that marginal likelihood ratio tests from beta regression models uniformly dominate popular alternatives based on linear models.  The superior sensitivity and specificity exhibited by beta regression in epidemiologically relevant cohort sizes corresponded to approximately a 2% increase in sensitivity at the same specificity when compared to linear models fitted on raw beta values (proportion of signal intensity due to the methylated allele), M-values, or rank quantile normalized values.

Investigators should consider beta regression to maximize statistical power in studies of DNA methylation using microarrays.

Policing can promote the evolution and maintenance of cooperation among non-relatives by tying the reproductive success of individuals to the efficiency and success of the group. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of reproductive policing using a multi-scale computational model inspired by the copy number control system of conjugative bacterial plasmids. Our results show that the repression of competition through policing can evolve across a very broad range of migration (plasmid conjugation) rates, improving system-level performance and bringing efficiency gains to the group beyond those achievable by pure self-restraint. Reproductive policing acts to increase genetic relatedness by reducing variation in group size which, in turn, reduces the heterogeneity of the plasmid population. When among-group migration is high, coercive policing strategies are favoured, characterized by high levels of policing coupled with relatively lower obedience.

Many species often have stable enough population dynamics that one can talk about a stochastic equilibrium population size N*. There is sometimes an assumption that N*and r are positively correlated, but there is lack of evidence for this.  To try to understand the relationship between r, N*, and T we used a simple chemostat model. The model shows that N* not only depends on r, but also on the mortality rate, the half-saturation constant of the nutrient limiting r, and the conversion coefficient of the limiting nutrient. Our analysis shows that N* positively correlates to r only with high mortality rate and half-saturation constant values. The response curve of N* vs. T can be flat, Gaussian, convex, and even temperature independent depending on the values of the variables in the model and their relationship to T. Moreover, whenever the populations have not reached equilibrium and might be in the process of doing so, it could be wrongly concluded that N* and r are positively correlated. Because of their low half-saturation constants, unless conditions are oligotrophic, microorganisms would tend to have flat abundance response curves to temperature even with high mortality rates. In contrast, unless conditions are eutrophic, it should be easier to get a Gaussian temperature response curve for multicellular organisms because of their high half-saturation constant. This work sheds light to why it is so difficult for any general principles to emerge on the abundance response to temperature.

We developed a metric to quantify the extent to which current sequencing technologies reach this clinical grade reporting standard.

Often this is performed with automated prediction pipelines, which can miss complex and atypical genes or transcripts. RNA-seq data can aid the annotation with empirical data. Here we present de novo transcriptome assemblies generated from RNA-seq  data in four Dictyostelid species: D. discoideum, P. pallidum, D. fasciculatum and D. lacteum. The assemblies were incorporated with existing gene models to determine corrections and improvement on a whole-genome scale. This is the first time this has been performed in these eukaryotic species.
Results: An initial de novo transcriptome assembly was generated by Trinity for each species and then refined with Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA). The completeness and quality were assessed with the Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) and Transrate tools at each stage of the assemblies. The final datasets of 11,315-12,849 transcripts contained 5,610-7,712 updates and corrections to >50% of existing gene models including changes to hundreds or thousands of protein products. Putative novel genes are also identified and alternative splice isoforms were observed for the first time in P. pallidum, D. lacteum and D. fasciculatum.
Conclusions: In taking a whole transcriptome approach to genome annotation with empirical data we have been able to enrich the annotations of four existing genome sequencing projects.

The new transcriptome data we present here will be a valuable resource for genome curators in the Dictyostelia and we propose this effective methodology for use in other genome annotation projects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Genomics/BMC Genomics47.pdf,"[( 25 May 2016 , 1), ( 24 May 2016 , 14)]"

However, the original version of tissue-driven hypothesis cannot rule out the tissue-specific effect of mutational variance. In this perspective, we solve this problem by modifying the evolutionary model that underlies the tissue expression evolution.

A sign of the presence of SCZ-like MDD sub-groups would be indicated by an interaction between MDD status and polygenic risk of SCZ on cognitive, personality and mood measures. In the current study, we hypothesised that higher SCZ-polygenic risk would define larger MDD case-control differences in cognitive ability, and smaller differences in distress and neuroticism. Polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for SCZ and their association with cognitive variables, neuroticism, mood, and psychological distress were estimated in a large population-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, GS:SFHS).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the bilateral Q neuroblasts and their descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions, despite being born in the same posterior region. QR on the right migrates anteriorly and generates the AQR neuron positioned near the head, and QL on the left migrates posteriorly, giving rise to the PQR neuron positioned near the tail. In a screen for genes required for AQR and PQR migration, we identified an allele of nfm-1, which encodes a molecule similar to vertebrate NF2/Merlin, an important tumor suppressor in humans. Mutations in NF2 lead to Neurofibromatosis Type II, characterized by benign tumors of glial tissues. These molecules contain Four-point-one Ezrin Radixin Moesin (FERM) domains characteristic of cytoskeletal-membrane linkers, and vertebrate NF2 is required for epidermal integrity. Vertebrate NF2 can also regulate several transcriptional pathways including the Hippo pathway. Here we demonstrate that in C. elegans, nfm-1 is required for complete migration of AQR and PQR, and that it likely acts outside of the Q cells themselves in a non-autonomous fashion. We also show a genetic interaction between nfm-1 and the C. elegans Slit homolog slt-1, which encodes a conserved secreted guidance cue.

Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various cancers.

Rather than fix expected functional forms of different experimental perturbations, we developed a general and robust model of microbial population growth curves using Gaussian process (GP) regression. GP regression modeling of high resolution time-series growth data enables accurate quantification of population growth, and can be extended to identify differential growth phenotypes due to genetic background or stress. Additionally, confounding effects due to experimental variation can be controlled explicitly.

For any given FST value, clusters can be tighter (more panmictic) or looser (more stratified), and in this respect higher FST does not always imply stronger differentiation.

Cooperative actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial populations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and hence create an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs.
Nevertheless, cooperation is ubiquitous in nature.
Both costs and benefits often depend non-linearly on the number and types of individuals involved -- as captured by idioms such as `too many cooks spoil the broth' where additional contributions are discounted, or `two heads are better than one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the group benefit. 
Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population and hence on ecological processes. 
This results in feedback mechanisms between ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the evolutionary trajectory. 
Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes became experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. 
Here we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of non-linear social dilemmas in settings where the population fluctuates in size and the environment changes over time.

In contrast to more conventional salivary measures, hair cortisol is not influenced by diurnal variation or transient hormonal reactivity. In an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1 070 child and adolescent twins and multiples from 556 unique families, we estimated genetic and environmental influences on hair concentrations of cortisol and its inactive metabolite, cortisone. We identified sizable genetic influences on cortisol that decrease with age, concomitant with genetic influences on cortisone that increase with age. Shared environmental influences on cortisol and cortisone were modest and, for cortisol, decreased with age. Twin-specific, non-shared environmental contributions to cortisol and cortisone became increasingly correlated with age. We find some evidence for sex differences in the biometric contributions to cortisol, but no strong evidence for main or moderating effects of family socioeconomic status on cortisol or cortisone. This study constitutes the first genetic study of hormone concentrations in human hair, and provides the most definitive characterization to-date of age and socioeconomic influences on hair cortisol.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Psychological Medicine/Psychological Medicine1.pdf,"[( 25 May 2016 , 24), ( 29 May 2016 , 1), ( 26 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 27 May 2016 , 1), ( 31 May 2016 , 1), ( 02 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 26 May 2016 , 7), ( 27 Nov 2016 , 1)]"

However, RNA transcriptional regulators suffer from incomplete repression, making their dynamic range less than that of their protein counterparts. This incomplete repression can cause expression leak, which impedes the construction of larger RNA synthetic regulatory networks. Here we demonstrate how naturally derived antisense RNA-mediated transcriptional regulators can be configured to regulate both transcription and translation in a single compact RNA mechanism that functions in Escherichia coli. Using in vivo gene expression assays, we show that a combination of transcriptional termination and RBS sequestration increases repression from 85% to 98% and activation from 10 fold to over 900 fold in response to cognate antisense RNAs. We also show that orthogonal versions of this mechanism can be created through engineering minimal antisense RNAs. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of this dual control mechanism, we use it to reduce circuit leak in an RNA-only transcriptional cascade that activates gene expression as a function of a small molecule input. We anticipate these regulators will find broad use as synthetic biology moves beyond parts engineering to the design and construction of larger and more sophisticated circuits.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research54.pdf,"[( 25 May 2016 , 4)]"

The mechanisms leading to the establishment and progression of the infection are currently unknown. An animal model to study these mechanisms is sorely needed. We report the first in vivo model of granulomatous pulmonary nocardiosis that closely resembles human pathology. BALB/c mice infected intranasally with two different doses of GFP-expressing Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC700358 (NbGFP), develop weight loss and pulmonary granulomas. Mice infected with 10^9 CFUs progressed towards death within a week while mice infected with 10^8 CFUs died after five to six months. Histological examination of the lungs revealed that both the higher and lower doses of NbGFP induced granulomas with NbGFP clearly identifiable at the center of the lesions. Mice exposed to 10^8 CFUs and subsequently to 10^9 CFUs were not protected against disease severity but had less granulomas suggesting some degree of protection. Attempts to identify a cellular target for the infection were unsuccessful but we found that bacterial microcolonies in the suspension used to infect mice were responsible for the establishment of the disease. Small microcolonies of NbGFP, incompatible with nocardial doubling times starting from unicellular organisms, were identified in the lung as early as six hours after infection. Mice infected with highly purified unicellular preparations of NbGFP did not develop granulomas despite showing weight loss. Finally, intranasal delivery of nocardial microcolonies was enough for mice to develop granulomas with minimal weight loss. Taken together these results show that Nocardia brasiliensis microcolonies are both necessary and sufficient for the development of granulomatous pulmonary nocardiosis in mice.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE138.pdf,"[( 25 May 2016 , 4), ( 01 Jun 2016 , 1)]"

Cytoskeletal remodeling and directional endothelial migration are essential for developmental and pathological angiogenesis. Smad-dependent TGFβ signaling controls vascular patterning and is negatively regulated by microtubules. Here we show that a positive regulator of TGFβ signaling is essential for developmental vascular patterning and microtubule stability. Rudhira/BCAS3 is known to bind microtubules and to play a nodal role in cytoskeletal remodeling and directional endothelial cell (EC) migration in vitro. We demonstrate that the molecular and cellular function of Rudhira is deployed at critical steps in vascular patterning. We generated the first floxed mice for rudhira and find that global or endothelial knockout of rudhira results in mid-gestation lethality due to aberrant embryonic and extra-embryonic vessel patterning and defective cardiac morphogenesis. Rudhira null yolk sac ECs show random and retarded migration. Yolk sac transcriptome analysis revealed key mediators of angiogenic processes and TGFβ receptor signaling were perturbed in rudhira null mutants. Molecular and biochemical analyses showed that rudhira depletion reduced microtubule stability but increased expression of pathway inhibitors leading to high levels of SMAD2/3 ubiquitination and reduced activation. These effects were not rescued by exogenous TGFβ. However, TGFβ treatment of wild type ECs increased Rudhira expression. Further, exogenous Rudhira, which promotes directional cell migration, caused increased SMAD2/3 nuclear translocation and reduced inhibitor levels. Therefore, we propose that Rudhira and TGFβ signaling are mutually dependent. Rudhira has a dual function in promoting TGFβ signaling, possibly by sequestering microtubules and simultaneously preventing SMAD2/3 ubiquitination to permit EC migration and vascular patterning. TGFβ signaling and aberrant human Rudhira (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 3, BCAS3) expression are both associated with tumour metastasis.

We present a framework to model gene transcription in populations of cells with time-varying (stochastic or deterministic) transcription and degradation rates. Such rates can be understood as upstream cellular drives representing the effect of different aspects of the cellular environment. We show that the full solution of the master equation contains two components: a model-specific, upstream effective drive, which encapsulates the effect of the cellular drives (e.g., entrainment, periodicity or promoter randomness), and a downstream transcriptional Poissonian part, which is common to all models. Our analytical framework allows us to treat cell-to-cell and dynamic variability consistently, unifying several approaches in the literature. We apply the obtained solution to characterize several gene transcription models of experimental relevance, and to explain the influence on gene transcription of synchrony, stationarity, ergodicity, as well as the effect of time-scales and other dynamic characteristics of drives.

Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions.

Assembly of large, outbred eukaryotic genomes can be difficult, but structural rearrangements within such taxa can be investigated using linkage maps. RAD sequencing provides unprecedented ability to generate high-density linkage maps for non-model species, but can result in low numbers of homologous markers between species due to phylogenetic distance or differences in library preparation. Family Salmonidae is ideal for studying the effects of WGD as the ancestral salmonid underwent WGD relatively recently, around 65 million years ago, then rediploidized and diversified. Extensive synteny between orthologous chromosomes occurs in extant salmonids, but each species has both conserved and unique chromosome arm fusions and fissions. Here we generate a high-density linkage map (3826 markers) for the Salvelinus genera (Brook Charr S. fontinalis), and then identify orthologous chromosome arms among the other available salmonid high-density linkage maps, including six species of Oncorhynchus, and one species for each of Salmo and Coregonus, as well as the sister group for the salmonids, Esox lucius for homeolog designation.

This approach increases the number of comparable markers between linkage maps by 5-fold, enabling a characterization of the most likely history of retained chromosomal rearrangements post-WGD, and identifying several conserved chromosomal inversions.

Most studies have looked for microevolutionary performance trade-offs within insect species, but host-use could also be constrained by macroevolutionary trade-offs caused by epistasis and historical contingency. On the other hand, evolutionary interactions between adaptations to diverse hosts could be neutral or positive rather than negative. Here we used a phylogenetic approach to estimate the micro- and macroevolutionary correlations between use of alternative host plants within two major orders of plant-feeding insects: Lepidoptera (caterpillars) and Hemiptera (true bugs). Across 1604 caterpillar species, we found both positive and negative pairwise correlations between use of diverse host taxa, with overall network patterns suggesting that different host-use constraints act over micro- and macroevolutionary timescales. In contrast, host-use patterns of 955 true bug species revealed uniformly positive correlations between presence on the same host taxa over both timescales. The lack of consistent patterns across timescales and insect orders indicates that host-use trade-offs are historically contingent rather than universal constraints. Moreover, we observed few negative correlations overall despite the wide taxonomic and ecological diversity of the focal host taxa, suggesting that positive interactions between host-use adaptations, not trade-offs, dominate the long-term evolution of host use in plant-feeding insects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/The American Naturalist/The American Naturalist9.pdf,"[( 24 May 2016 , 2), ( 20 Feb 2016 , 1), ( 09 Mar 2016 , 3), ( 19 Feb 2016 , 3), ( 10 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

These GABAARs are highly expressed within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) where they influence the excitability of the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Here we explore their role in modulating behavioural responses to reward-conditioned cues and the behaviour-potentiating effects of cocaine. α4-subunit constitutive knockout mice (α4-/-) showed higher rates of instrumental responding for reward-paired stimuli in a test of conditioned reinforcement (CRf). A similar effect was seen following viral knockdown of GABAAR α4 subunits within the NAc. Local infusion of the δ-GABAAR-preferring agonist, THIP, into the NAc had no effect on responding when given alone, but reduced cocaine potentiation of responding for conditioned reinforcers in wildtype but not α4-/- mice. Finally, specific deletion of α4-subunits from dopamine D2-, but not D1-receptor-expressing neurons, mimicked the phenotype of the constitutive knockout, potentiating CRf responding and blocking intra-accumbal THIP attenuation of cocaine-potentiated CRf responding. These data demonstrate that α4-GABAAR mediated inhibition of dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons reduces instrumental-responding for a conditioned reinforcer, and its potentiation by cocaine, and emphasise the potential importance of GABAergic signalling within the NAc in mediating cocaine′s effects.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1573.pdf,"[( 27 May 2016 , 2)]"

A particularly important stimulus is temperature. Previous work has identified the interplay of PIF4 and ELF3 as a central circuit underlying thermal responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, thermal responses vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis to test the hypothesis that natural polyQ variation in ELF3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in thermal responses beyond modulating general ELF3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF3 plays a crucial, PIF4-independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with vastly different thermal responses, we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains.

Assuming that infected men transmit the disease to women in their semen but that the converse is not true, some extra incidence in women is to be expected. An alternate hypothesis would be that women visit doctors more often than men. To test this, we compared the incidence of dengue fever in men and women in 2015 and in 2013 (before Zika reached Rio de Janeiro): in both years, women are 30% more likely to be reported with dengue.

Summing up, women in the sexually active age bracket are far more likely to get Zika than men (+90% increase); sexual transmission is the most probable cause.

In human patients implanted with electrocorticographic sensors, we apply our virtual cortical resection technique to time-varying functional networks and identify control regions that synchronize or desynchronize cortical areas using an antagonistic push-pull control scheme to raise or lower synchronizability. Our results suggest that synchronizability before seizures predicts seizure evolution: in focal seizures, the strongest controllers are located outside seizure-generating areas.

We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modelling. We apply this framework to host parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact.

Cytomegalovirus can cause fatal disease in immunocompromised patients. With the advent of new anti-HCMV drugs there is interest in using virus sequence data to monitor resistance and identify new mutations.  
Methods
We used target-enrichment to deep sequence HCMV DNA from 11 immunosuppressed paediatric patients receiving single or combination anti-HCMV treatment, serially sampled over 1-27 weeks. Changes in consensus sequence and resistance mutations were analysed for three ORFs targeted by anti-HCMV drugs and the frequencies of drug resistance mutations monitored.  
Results
Targeted-enriched sequencing of clinical material detected mutations occurring at frequencies of 2%. Seven patients showed no evidence of drug resistance mutations. Four patients developed drug resistance mutations a mean of 16 weeks after starting treatment. In two patients, multiple resistance mutations accumulated at frequencies of 20% or less, including putative resistance mutations P522Q (UL54) and C480F (UL97). In one patient, resistance was detected 14 days earlier than by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis suggested recombination or superinfection in one patient.

The very large sample size of the UK Biobank is ideal for detecting selection using population differentiation, and enables an analysis of UK population structure at fine resolution.  In analyses of 113,851 UK Biobank samples, population structure in the UK is dominated by 5 principal components (PCs) spanning 6 clusters: Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England, southern England, and two Welsh clusters.  Analyses with ancient Eurasians show that populations in the northern UK have higher levels of Steppe ancestry, and that UK population structure cannot be explained as a simple mixture of Celts and Saxons.  A scan for unusual population differentiation along top PCs identified a genome-wide significant signal of selection at the coding variant rs601338 in FUT2 (p=9.16×10-9).  In addition, by combining evidence of unusual differentiation within the UK with evidence from ancient Eurasians, we identified new genome-wide significant (p<5×10-8) signals of recent selection at two additional loci: CYP1A2/CSK and F12.  We detected strong associations to diastolic blood pressure in the UK Biobank for the variants with new selection signals at CYP1A2/CSK (p=1.10×10-19)) and for variants with ancient Eurasian selection signals in the ATXN2/SH2B3 locus (p=8.00×10-33), implicating recent adaptation related to blood pressure.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/American Journal of Human Genetics/American Journal of Human Genetics17.pdf,"[( 07 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 29 May 2016 , 4), ( 30 May 2016 , 1), ( 16 Oct 2016 , 4), ( 27 May 2016 , 19), ( 31 May 2016 , 3), ( 02 Jun 2016 , 4), ( 28 May 2016 , 7)]"

post-translational modification (PTM) types is a challenging task. The computational
cost increases exponentially with respect to the number of modifiable amino acids and
linearly with respect to the number of potential PTM types at each amino acid. The
problem becomes intractable very quickly if we want to enumerate all possible modi-
fication patterns. Existing tools (e.g., MS-Alignment, ProteinProspector, and MODa)
avoid enumerating modification patterns in database search by using an alignment-
based approach to localize and characterize modified amino acids. This approach avoids
enumerating all possible modification patterns in a database search. However, due to
the large search space and PTM localization issue, the sensitivity of these tools is low.

This paper proposes a novel method named PIPI to achieve PTM-invariant peptide
identification. PIPI first codes peptide sequences into Boolean vectors and converts
experimental spectra into real-valued vectors. Then, it finds the top 10 peptide-coded
vectors for each spectrum-coded vector. After that, PIPI uses a dynamic program-
ming algorithm to localize and characterize modified amino acids. Simulations and
real data experiments have shown that PIPI outperforms existing tools by identifying
more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and reporting fewer false positives. It also
runs much faster than existing tools when the database is large.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Journal Of Proteome Research/Journal Of Proteome Research2.pdf,"[( 13 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 14 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 28 May 2016 , 1), ( 27 May 2016 , 4)]"

In the receiving cell, signaling results in cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain and its import into the nucleus, where it binds Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] to promote gene expression in conjunction with contextual cues in the surrounding DNA sequence. To investigate the nature of this contextual logic, we identify 1344 Su(H)-site containing regulatory belts that are conserved across the Drosophila genus. Each Su(H)-type regulatory belt (SUH-RB) is a 0.6–1.0 kb chain of conservation peaks consistent with a transcriptional enhancer or core promoter. These regulatory belts contain one or more canonical binding sites for Su(H) along with ~15–30 other binding sites. SUH-RBs are densely clustered in certain chromosomal regions such as the E(spl)-complex, the Wnt gene complex, and genes encoding Notch receptor ligands (Delta and Serrate). SUH-RBs overlap most known Su(H)/Notch-target enhancers and others, including non-embryonic enhancers that are not identified by embryonic ChIP-seq peaks. Thus, SUH-RBs overcome the stage-specific nature of embryonic ChIP-seq peaks and suggest a pervasive role for contextual tissue-specific pioneer and/or enhancer-licensing factors. SUH-RBs also delineate false positive ChIP-seq peaks, which do not overlap SUH-RBs, are missing even the weakest Su(H)-binding sequences, and have the shortest ChIP peak widths.

In this model, parasitic behavior can become prevalent and substantially reduce host fitness. However, it may also evolve to be mutualistic and raise the mean fitness of the host organism.

Deciding a priori which assays to perform---e.g., a few complementary histone modification ChIP-seq experiments, perhaps an open chromatin assay, plus a few diverse transcription factor assays---is thus a critical step in many studies.
Unfortunately, the field currently lacks a principled method for making these choices.
We present submodular selection of assays (SSA), a method for choosing a diverse panel of genomic assays that leverages methods from the field of submodular optimization.
We also describe a series of evaluation methods that allow us to measure the quality of a selected assay panel in the context of inference tasks such as data imputation, functional element prediction, and semi-automated genome annotation.
Applying this evaluation framework to data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Consortia, we provide empirical evidence that SSA provides high quality panels of assays.
The method is computationally efficient and is theoretically optimal under certain assumptions.
SSA is extremely flexible, and can be employed to select assays for a new cell type or to select additional assays to be performed in a partially characterized cell type.

For most species, the highest typical degree of relatedness is between full siblings with 50% shared genes. However, this is poorly understood in species with unusually high relatedness between individuals: clonal organisms. Although there has been some investigation into clonal invertebrates and yeast, nothing is known about kin selection in clonal vertebrates. We show that a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), can distinguish between different clonal lineages, associating with genetically identical, sister clonals, and use multiple sensory modalities. Also, they scale their aggressive behaviors according to the relatedness to other females: they are more aggressive to non-related clones. Our results demonstrate that even in species with very small genetic differences between individuals, kin recognition can be adaptive. Their discriminatory abilities and regulation of costly behaviors provides a powerful example of natural selection in species with limited genetic diversity.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/PLOS ONE/PLOS ONE140.pdf,"[( 01 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 31 May 2016 , 5)]"

The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear behavior of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational selection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the linkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1584.pdf,"[( 28 Mar 2016 , 1), ( 12 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 06 May 2016 , 1), ( 24 Mar 2016 , 4), ( 25 Mar 2016 , 2)]"

Yet, in empirical studies, inferred gene trees differ in accuracy due to stochastic variation in phylogenetic signal between targeted loci. Empiricists should therefore examine the consistency of species tree inference, while accounting for the observed heterogeneity in gene tree resolution of phylogenomic datasets. Here, we assess the impact of gene tree estimation error on summary-coalescent species tree inference by screening ~2000 exonic loci based on gene tree resolution prior to phylogenetic inference. We focus on a phylogenetically challenging radiation of Australian lizards (genus Cryptoblepharus, Scincidae) and explore effects on topology and support. We identify a well-supported topology based on all loci and find that a relatively small number of high-resolution gene trees can be sufficient to converge on the same topology. Adding gene trees with decreasing resolution produced a generally consistent topology, and increased confidence for specific bipartitions that were poorly supported when using a small number of informative loci. This corroborates coalescent-based simulation studies that have highlighted the need for a large number of loci to confidently resolve challenging relationships and refutes the notion that low-resolution gene trees introduce phylogenetic noise. Further, our study also highlights the value of quantifying changes in nodal support across locus subsets of increasing size (but decreasing gene tree resolution). Such detailed analyses can reveal anomalous fluctuations in support at some nodes, suggesting the possibility of model violation. By characterizing the heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal among loci, we can account for uncertainty in gene tree estimation and assess its effect on the consistency of the species tree estimate. We suggest that the evaluation of gene tree resolution should be incorporated in the analysis of empirical phylogenomic datasets. This will ultimately increase our confidence in species tree estimation using summary-coalescent methods and enable us to exploit genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Systematic Biology/Systematic Biology21.pdf,"[( 31 May 2016 , 5), ( 03 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 04 Jun 2016 , 1)]"

This remarkable pattern suggests extreme fidelity to their birth site in cave bears, best described as homing behaviour, and that cave bears formed stable maternal social groups at least for hibernation. In contrast, brown bears do not show any strong association of mitochondrial lineage and cave, suggesting that these two closely related species differed in aspects of their behaviour and sociality. This difference is likely to have contributed to cave bear extinction, which occurred at a time in which competition for caves between bears and humans was likely intense and the ability to rapidly colonise new hibernation sites would have been crucial for the survival of a species so dependent on caves for hibernation as cave bears.

While some proposals have suggested the two phenomena are linked, behavioral priming has been observed many years after initial exposure, whereas RS is widely considered a transitory phenomenon. This raises the question: what is the true upper limit of RS persistence? To answer this question, we scanned healthy, English-native adults with fMRI as they viewed novel (Asian) proverbs, recently repeated (Asian) proverbs, and previously known (English) proverbs that were matched on various dimensions. We then estimated RS by comparing repeated or previously known proverbs against novel ones. Multivariate analyses linked previously known and repeated proverbs with statistically indistinguishable RS in a broad visual-linguistic network. In each suppressed region, prior knowledge and repetition also induced a common shift in functional connectivity, further underscoring the similarity of the RS phenomenon induced by these conditions. By contrast, activated regions readily distinguished prior knowledge and repetition conditions in a manner consistent with engagement of semantic and episodic memory systems, respectively. Our results illustrate that regardless of whether RS is understood in terms of its magnitude, spatial extent or functional connectivity profile, typical RS effects can be elicited even under conditions where recently triggered biological processes or episodic memory are unlikely to play a prominent role.

These abnormalities were originally thought to reflect a pleiotropic impact of silencing suppressors on miRNA control of plant development. However, subsequent work with the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing showed that global impairment of the miRNA pathway was not responsible for the phenotypical anomalies. More recently, developmental defects caused by a P1/HC-Pro transgene under control of the 35S promoter were attributed to moderate upregulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence in that work was that the developmental defects in the 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgenic Arabidopsis were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the arf8-6 mutation. Arf8-6 is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. Here we report a re-investigation of the role of ARF8 in P1/HC-Pro-mediated developmental defects. We characterized the progeny of a cross between our 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgenic Arabidopsis line and the same arf8-6 T-DNA insertion mutant used in the earlier study. The T-DNA mutation had little effect in the F1 generation, but almost all arf8-6/P1/HC-Pro progeny had lost the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F2 generation. However, this loss of phenotype was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the ARF8 gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA accompanied by the appearance of 35S promoter siRNAs. Furthermore, arf8-8, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations.

We use this propensity to detect the sites and communication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their significance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set of 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three well-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly predicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric interactions.

In this work we examine the effects of ancestry-assortative mating on the linkage disequilibrium between local ancestry tracks of individuals in an admixed population. To accomplish this, we develop an extension to the Wright-Fisher model that allows for ancestry based assortative mating. We show that ancestry-assortment perturbs the distribution of local ancestry linkage disequilibrium (LAD) and the variance of ancestry in a population as a function of the number of generations since admixture. This assortment effect can induce errors in demographic inference of admixed populations when methods assume random mating. We derive closed form formulae for LAD under an assortative-mating model with and without migration. We observe that LAD depends on the correlation of global ancestry of couples in each generation, the migration rate of each of the ancestral populations, the initial proportions of ancestral populations, and the number of generations since admixture.

We sequenced the kelch13 gene (n=1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (n=3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001-2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations: these included common mutations outside the kelch13 propeller region associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ~0.079. There was no change in diversity in flanking markers, but resistance allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The rapid spread of C580Y suggests that the genomic signature may be considerably harder in the near future, and that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective sweeps. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation to generate beneficial alleles and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep:  (1) multiple amino-acid mutations in kelch13 can confer resistance providing a large mutational target: we estimate the target size is between 87 and 163bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (θ=2Neμ) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of resistant alleles and is ~ 5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is between 88 thousand and 1.2 million. This is 52 to 705-fold greater than Ne estimates based on fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in Plasmodium.

Here, we provide evidence for the existence of trans-eQTLs by looking for SNPs associated with the expression of multiple genes simultaneously. We find substantial evidence of trans-eQTLs, with an 1.8-fold enrichment in nominally significant markers in all three populations and significant overlap between results across the populations.

In the presence of gene flow, a phylogeny cannot be described by a tree but is instead a directed acyclic graph known as a phylogenetic network. Both phylogenetic trees and networks are typically reconstructed using computational analysis of multi-locus sequence data. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about two main scalability challenges: (1) dataset size in terms of the number of taxa and (2) the evolutionary divergence of the taxa in a study. The impact of both dimensions of scale on phylogenetic tree inference has been well characterized by recent studies; in contrast, the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the performance of state-of-the-art phylogenetic network inference methods on large-scale datasets using empirical data sampled from natural mouse populations and synthetic data capturing a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.

Results: We find that, as in the case of phylogenetic tree inference, the performance of leading network inference methods is negatively impacted by both dimensions of dataset scale. In general, we found that topological accuracy degrades as the number of taxa increases; a similar effect was observed with increased sequence mutation rate. The most accurate methods were probabilistic inference methods which maximize either likelihood under coalescent-based models or pseudo-likelihood approximations to the model likelihood. Furthermore, probabilistic inference methods with optimization criteria which did not make use of gene tree root and/or branch length information performed best - a result that runs contrary to widely held assumptions in the literature. The improved accuracy obtained with probabilistic inference methods comes at a computational cost in terms of runtime and main memory usage, which quickly become prohibitive as dataset size grows past thirty taxa.

Conclusions: We conclude that the state of the art of phylogenetic network inference lags well behind the scope of current phylogenomic studies.

Background: The phylogenetic information inferred from the study of homologous genes helps us to understand the evolution of gene families. The study of homology plays a vital role in finding ancestral gene duplication events as well as identifying regions that are under positive selection within species. Conservation of homologous loci results in syntenic blocks, and there are various tools available to visualise syntenic information between species. These tools provide an overview of syntenic regions as a whole, reaching down to the gene level, but none provide any information about structural changes within genes such as the conservation of ancestral exon boundaries amongst multiple genomes.
Findings: We present Aequatus, a standalone web-based tool that provides an in-depth view of gene structure across gene families, with various options to render and filter visualisations. It relies on pre-calculated alignment and gene feature information held in an Ensembl database, typically generated through the Ensembl Compara workflow.

To test the role of corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence in the formation of bimanual muscle synergies, we experimentally manipulated the degree of coordination between hand muscles by varying the sensitivity of the visual feedback to differences in bilateral force. In 16 healthy participants, cortical activity was measured using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle activity of the flexor pollicis brevis muscle of both hands using 8x8-channel high-density electromyography (HDsEMG). Using the uncontrolled manifold framework, coordination between bilateral forces was quantified by the synergy index RV in the time and frequency domain. Functional connectivity was assed using corticomuscular coherence between muscle activity and cortical source activity and intermuscular coherence between bilateral EMG activity. As expected, bimanual synergies were stronger in the high coordination condition. RV was higher in the high coordination condition in frequencies between 0 and 0.5 Hz, and above 2 Hz. For the 0.5-2 Hz frequency band this pattern was inverted. Corticomuscular coherence in the beta band (16-30 Hz) was maximal in the contralateral motor cortex and was reduced in the high coordination condition. In contrast, intermuscular coherence was observed at 5-12 Hz and increased with bimanual coordination. Within-subject comparisons revealed a negative correlation between RV and corticomuscular coherence and a positive correlation between RV and intermuscular coherence.

Location Hawaiian Islands.
Methods We sampled 153 individuals in 15 of the 16 native species of Hawaiian Euphorbia section Anisophyllum on six major Hawaiian Islands, plus 11 New World close relatives, to elucidate the biogeographic movement of this lineage along the Hawaiian island chain. We used a concatenated chloroplast DNA data set of more than eight kilobases in aligned length and applied maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference for phylogenetic reconstruction. Connectivity among islands and habitat types was estimated using BayesTraits. Age and phylogeographic patterns were co-estimated using BEAST. In addition, we used nuclear ribosomal ITS and the low-copy genes LEAFY and G3pdhC to investigate the reticulate relationships within this radiation.
Results We estimate that Hawaiian Euphorbia first arrived on Kauai or Niihau ca. 5 million years ago and subsequently diverged into 16 species on all major Hawaiian Islands. During this process Euphorbia dispersed from older to younger islands in a stepping-stone fashion through open, dispersal-prone habitats. Taxa that occupy closed vegetation on Kauai and Oahu evolved in situ from open vegetation taxa of the same island. Consequently, widespread species tend to occupy habitats with open vegetation, whereas single island endemic species predominantly occur in habitats with closed canopy and are only found on the two oldest islands of Kauai and Oahu.
Main conclusions The spatial and temporal patterns of dispersal and range shifts in Hawaiian Euphorbia support an intra-volcanic-archipelago version of the taxon cycle hypothesis.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1599.pdf,"[( 02 Jun 2016 , 15)]"

By inducing muscle or endoderm transdifferentiation by the ectopic expression of selector transcription factors, we show that cell fate is remarkably robust in fully differentiated larvae. This stability depends on the presence of the Polycomb-associated histone H3K27 methylation, but not H3K9 methylation: in the absence of this epigenetic mark, many cells can be transdifferentiated which correlates with definitive developmental arrest. A candidate RNAi screen unexpectedly uncovered that knock-down of somatic NotchLIN-12 signaling rescues this larval arrest. Similarly in a wild-type context, genetically increasing NotchLIN-12 signaling renders a fraction of the animals sensitive to induced transdifferentiation.

The mechanisms that drive this resistance--especially epigenetic events that alter gene expression--are however not well understood. Genome-wide DNA methylation and expression analysis of cell line models of acquired aromatase inhibitor resistance indicated that prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (PTGER4) is up-regulated after demethylation in resistant cells.

Creating  these genes has recently become possible with CRISPR technology.  One seemingly feasible approach, originally proposed by Burt, is to create a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) that inserts into an essential gene, enabling heterozygote viability but causing homozygote lethality.  With 100\% segregation distortion in gametes, such genes can cause profound population suppression if resistance does not evolve.  Here, population genetic models  are used to consider the evolution of inbreeding (specifically selfing) as a possible response to a recessively lethal HEG with complete segregation distortion.  Numerical analyses indicate a rich set of outcomes, but selfing often evolves in response to the HEG, with a corresponding partial restoration of mean fitness.

A previous mutant screen demonstrated that the heme uptake system (Chu) is required for full colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract.  Subsequent work found identified a PAS domain containing regulator, termed HeuR, as required for chicken colonization.  Here we confirm that both the heme uptake system and HeuR are required for full chicken gastrointestinal tract colonization, with the heuR mutant being particularly affected during competition with wild-type C. jejuni.  Transcriptomic analysis identified the chu genes, and those encoding other iron uptake systems, as likely regulatory targets of HeuR. Purified HeuR specifically bound the chuZA promoter region in electrophoretic mobility shift assays.   Consistent with a role for HeuR in chu expression, heuR mutants were unable to efficiently use heme as a source of iron in iron-limiting conditions and, mutants exhibited decreased levels of cell associated iron by mass spectrometry.

During early development, dl is sequestered outside the nucleus by Cactus (Cact), homologous to IκB. Toll signaling at the ventral midline breaks the dl/Cact complex, allowing dl to enter the nucleus where it transcribes target genes. Here we show that dl accumulates on the ventral side of the embryo over the last 5 cleavage cycles and that this accumulation is the result of facilitated diffusion of dl/Cact complex.

One benefit of kin selection is a reduction in aggression towards kin in various social contexts, such as foraging. In the gynogenetic Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, females have been shown to differentiate between clone types, preferring to associate with clonal sisters to non-sisters, and regulate their aggressive behaviors accordingly. We ask if Amazon mollies in resource-limited environments: 1) still maintain the ability to regulate aggressive behaviors according to relatedness (heterospecific females, clonal sisters or non-sisters), and 2) how their aggressive behaviors change relative to a social partner?  Using a repeated-measures design, we found that focal females regulated their aggressive behaviors depending on partner type (i.e., a heterospecific female, clonal sister, or non-sister). Heterospecific females and the non-sister clones spent more time behaving aggressively towards the focal females, and these females also  received significantly more bites from heterospecific females. Interestingly, the clonal sisters, when compared to the other two female types, performed significantly more tail beats towards focal females.

Thus, many aspects of this phenomenon remain poorly understood limiting the development of efficacious treatment for women. Menstruating species account for only 1.5% of mammals, and less than 0.09% of these are non-primates. Menstruation occurs as a consequence of progesterone priming of the endometrial stroma and a spontaneous decidual reaction. At the end of each infertile cycle as progesterone levels decline the uterus is unable to maintain this terminally differentiated stroma and the superficial endometrium is shed. True menstruation has never been reported in rodents. 
Objective: Here we describe the first observation of menstruation in a rodent, the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). 
Study Design: Virgin female spiny mice (n=14) aged 12-16 weeks were sampled through daily vaginal lavage for 2 complete reproductive cycles in our in-house colony at Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Australia. Stage-specific collection of reproductive tissue and plasma was used for histology, prolactin immunohistochemistry, and ELISA assay of progesterone (n=5 / stage of the menstrual cycle). Normally distributed data are reported as the mean ± standard error and significant differences calculated using a one-way ANOVA. Non-normal data are displayed as the median values of replicates (with interquartile range) and significant differences calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test.
Results: Mean cycle length was 8.7 ± 0.4 days with red blood cells observed in the lavages over 3.0 ± 0.2 days. Cyclic endometrial shedding and blood in the vaginal canal concluding with each infertile cycle was confirmed in all virgin females. The endometrium was thickest during the luteal phase, when plasma progesterone peaked at ~102.1 ng/mL and the optical density for prolactin immunoreactivity was strongest. The spiny mouse undergoes spontaneous decidualisation, demonstrating for the first time menstruation in a rodent. Conclusion: The spiny mouse is the first rodent species known to menstruate and provides an unprecedented natural non-primate model to study the mechanisms of menstrual shedding and repair, and may be useful in furthering our understanding of human specific menstrual and pregnancy associated diseases.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology2.pdf,"[( 07 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 07 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 02 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 10 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 15 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 13 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 04 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 06 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 17 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Recent work from our institution compared several biopsy findings in low- and intermediate-risk patients and found a subset of patients who were more likely to fail treatment. This indicates patients in these groups may benefit from further risk stratification prior to initiation of therapy. Furthermore, findings on pre-treatment prostate MRI independently predict PSA relapse after external beam radiation therapy. Comparing MRI and pathological data may help to accurately further risk stratify patients. Our purpose is to determine if there is a correlation between the poor prognostic factors demonstrated on prostate biopsy cores and selected findings on prostate MRI.

Methods: Intermediate risk prostate cancer patients with 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla MRI scans of the prostate performed from 2007-2011 were selected for a retrospective cohort study. Cases were reviewed by two body-trained radiologists who were blinded to clinical patient information. Reader consensus was obtained at the time of reading regarding presence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and disease in each sextant by T2 and ADC imaging, including a dominant nodule. Results were analyzed for correlation between these findings on MRI and compared with results of prostate biopsy cores, including maximum involvement of any biopsy core (MIBC), percentage of cancer volume (PCV) and percent positive biopsy cores (PPBC). 

Results: The absolute presence of a dominant nodule on MRI was statistically significantly correlated with elevated PCV and PPBC applying the t-test for equality of means, with p-values of 0.019 and 0.006 respectively. PSA, Gleason score, and MIBC were not found to be correlated with dominant nodule on MRI.

We employed autonomous hydrophone receivers to record the soundscapes of healthy hard-bottom habitat in Florida Bay, Florida (USA) and hard-bottom areas impacted by sponge die-offs.  We also recorded sounds emanating from individual sponges of three species that were isolated in underwater sound booths, and then enumerated the invertebrates (mostly snapping shrimp) dwelling within the canals of each sponge. From these recordings, a modified cylindrical sound propagation model was used to estimate distances to snapping shrimp snaps. Using the program Distance, which applies distance sampling theory to cue count surveys, we estimated snapping shrimp population density and abundance within both habitat types. More snapping shrimp snaps per unit time were recorded in healthy hard-bottom areas as compared to degraded hard-bottom areas. In addition, the average distance to a snap source was greater within degraded hard-bottom areas than within healthy hard-bottom areas. As a consequence, the estimated density and abundance of snapping shrimp were one to two orders of magnitude greater within healthy habitat than within degraded habitat.

How cells ensure precision in the timing of key intracellular events, in spite of such stochasticity is an intriguing fundamental problem. We formulate event timing as a first-passage time problem, where an event is triggered when the level of a protein crosses a critical threshold for the first time. Novel analytical calculations are preformed for the first-passage time distribution in stochastic models of gene expression, including models with feedback regulation. Derivation of these formulas motivates an interesting question: is there an optimal feedback strategy to regulate the synthesis of a protein to ensure that an event will occur at a precise time, while minimizing deviations or noise about the mean. Counter-intuitively, results show that for a stable long-lived protein, the optimal strategy is to express the protein at a constant rate without any feedback regulation, and any form of feedback (positive, negative or any combination of them) will always amplify noise in event timing. In contrast, a positive feedback mechanism provides the highest precision in timing for an unstable protein. These theoretical results explain recent experimental observations of single-cell lysis times in bacteriophage λ. Here, lysis of an infected bacterial cell is orchestrated by the expression and accumulation of a stable λ protein up to a threshold, and precision in timing is achieved via feedforward, rather than feedback control.

Chemical and thermodynamic models offer theoretical tools to describe populations of biomacromolecules and their relative potential for formation in different microenvironmental conditions. The average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formulas of proteins, and water demand per residue (n̄H2O) is computed by writing the overall formation reactions of proteins from basis species. Using reported results from clinical proteomic studies and microbial community profiling, many datasets exhibit higher mean ZC or n̄H2O of proteins in carcinoma or adenoma compared to normal tissue. Microbial protein compositions have lower ZC in bacteria enriched in fecal samples from cancer patients. In thermodynamic calculations, the potential for formation of the cancer-related proteins is energetically favored by changes in the chemical activity of H2O and fugacity of O2 that reflect the compositional differences.

Recently, it was proposed that ALT renders cells hypersensitive to ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related (ATR) protein inhibitors (Flynn et al., Science 347, 273).

Adaptations that promote selfing in flowering plants with specialized pollination systems have been considered as a mechanism for reproductive assurance. In this paper, we analyzed the breeding system and pollinator visitation rate of the hummingbird-pollinated bromeliad Pitcairnia heterophylla in order to see if they fit such trend. We performed hand pollination experiments, video recording of floral visitors, and recorded floral traits in order to describe the reproductive and pollination system of the studied species in a cloud forest in Costa Rica. Results from the pollination treatments indicated that P. heterophylla is self-compatible (SCIf  = 0.77), capable of autonomous pollination (AFI f = 0.78), and non-agamospermous (AGf  = 0.01). Floral traits, such as scentless red flowers, with tubular corolla and nectar production, suggested ornithophily which was confirmed by the video recording of Lampornis calolaemus (Trochilidae) visiting flowers. However, the visitation rate was low (0.6 visits day-1 per plant) based on 918 hours of video recording using trail cameras. We suggest that the high selfing capability of the studied population of P. heterophylla might be related to the low pollinator visitation rate. If low pollinator visitation is common among hummingbird-pollinated and epiphytic bromeliads, then selfing could be a widespread mechanism to enhance their reproductive success.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1613.pdf,"[( 04 Jun 2016 , 5)]"

One such issue are differences in cell size, which introduce additional variability into the data, for which appropriate normalization techniques are needed. Otherwise, these differences in cell size may obscure genuine heterogeneities among cell populations and lead to overdispersed steady-state distributions of mRNA transcript numbers.
Results: We present cgCorrect, a statistical framework to correct for differences in cell size that are due to cell growth in single-cell transcriptomics data. We derive the probability for the cell growth corrected mRNA transcript number given the measured, cell size dependent mRNA transcript number, based on the assumption that the average number of transcripts in a cell increases proportional to the cell's volume during cell cycle. cgCorrect can be used for both data normalization, and to analyze steady-state distributions used to infer the gene expression mechanism. We demonstrate its applicability on both simulated data and single-cell quantitative real-time PCR data from mouse blood stem and progenitor cells.

A total of 2,934 genes were differentially expressed at only one (45.19%) or at multiple (54.81%) developmental time points.

As a link between fiber QTLs and gene expression, 5 potential developmentally regulated QTLs (drQTLs) corresponding to different fiber developmental stages were identified. Genes in the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway, particularly QTL associated genes, appeared to be involved in regulating the transition stage between PCW and SCW; a stage that is crucial to both fiber length and strength in the extra-long staple cotton genotypes. In this respect, Yeast-two-hybrids identified interactions between UBC9 and genes involved in cell and organ elongation, polar cell expansion, microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics and organization, and basic amino acids transportation during the SCW/SCW transition.

We used this data to build a model of mixture responses that incorporated nonlinear interactions and trial-to-trial variability and explored potential decoding mechanisms that can mimic mouse performance from our previous study (Rokni et al., 2014) when given glomerular responses as input. We find that a linear decoder with sparse weights could match mouse performance using just a small subset of the glomeruli (~15). However, when such a decoder is trained only with single odors, it generalizes poorly to mixture stimuli due to nonlinear mixture responses. We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, although they could in principle fully decompose the mixtures.

We asked whether Levelt's Propositions extend to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping. To address this question we used split-grating stimuli with complementary halves of the same color. As in previous studies, subjects reported four percepts in alternation: the two stimuli presented to each eye (single-eye percepts), as well as two interocularly grouped, single color percepts (grouped percepts). Most subjects responded to increased color saturation by more frequently reporting  a single color image, thus increasing the predominance of grouped percepts (Levelt's Proposition I). In these subjects increased predominance was due to a decrease in the average dominance duration of single-eye percepts, while that of grouped percepts remained largely unaffected. This is in accordance with generalized Levelt's Proposition II which posits that the average dominance duration of the stronger (in this case single-eye) percept is primarily affected by changes in stimulus strength. 
In accordance with Proposition III, the alternation rate increased as the difference in the strength of the percepts decreased. 
To explain the mechanism behind these observations, we introduce a hierarchical model consisting of low-level neural populations, each responding to input at a visual hemifield, and  higher-level populations representing the percepts.

Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: (i) selecting an action among several alternatives, and (ii) choosing the response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Previous works have addressed the computational substrates of such a selection process under the assumption that outcome values are stationary and do not change during the course of a session. This assumption does not hold when the motivational drive of the decision-maker is variable, because it leads to changes in the values of the outcomes, e.g., satiety decreases the value of the outcome. Here, we utilize an optimal control framework and derive the optimal choice and response vigor under different experimental conditions. The results imply that, in contrast to previous suggestions, even under conditions that the values of the outcomes are changing during the session, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate rather than decreasing. Furthermore, we prove that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the duration of the session explains the commonly observed decrease in response rates within a session. We also show that when the environment consists of multiple outcomes, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies.

Four main classes of dysregulation accompany PE, and are widely considered to contribute to its severity. These are abnormal trophoblast invasion of the placenta, anti-angiogenic responses, oxidative stress, and inflammation. What is lacking, however, is an explanation of how these themselves are caused.

We here develop the unifying idea, and the considerable evidence for it, that the originating cause of PE (and of the four classes of dysregulation) is in fact microbial infection, that most such microbes are dormant and hence resist detection by conventional (replication-dependent) microbiology, and that by occasional resuscitation and growth it is they that are responsible for all the observable sequelae, including the continuing, chronic inflammation. In particular, bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, are well known as highly inflammagenic and stimulate an innate (and possibly trained) immune response that exacerbates the inflammation further. The known need of microbes for free iron can explain the iron dysregulation that accompanies PE. We describe the main routes of infection (gut, oral, urinary tract infection) and the regularly observed presence of microbes in placental and other tissues in PE. Every known proteomic biomarker of “pre-eclampsia” that we assessed has in fact also been shown to be raised in response to infection.  An infectious component to PE fulfils the Bradford Hill criteria for ascribing a disease to an environmental cause, and suggests a number of treatments, some of which have in fact been shown to be successful.

PE was classically referred to as endotoxaemia or toxaemia of pregnancy, and it is ironic that it seems that LPS and other microbial endotoxins really are involved. Overall, the recognition of an infectious component in the aetiology of PE mirrors that for ulcers and other diseases that were previously considered to lack one.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1621.pdf,"[( 07 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 08 Jun 2016 , 10), ( 28 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 10 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 09 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 23 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 17 Jan 2017 , 2), ( 20 Jan 2017 , 2)]"

The likelihood for a given plant species to belong to the dark diversity pool was computed and logistically regressed against its ecological preferences (nutrient availability, pH etc.), strategies (competitor, stress tolerance, ruderal), mycorrhizal dependence and infection percentage, seed mass and maximum dispersal distance. 3 Forty-six percent of the species were absent in >95 % of the suitable sites, whereas 7 % of the species were absent in less than 60 % of sites that were deemed suitable. 4 Species that were more likely to belong to the dark diversity tended to depend on mycorrhiza, were mostly adapted to low light and nutrient levels, had poor dispersal abilities, were ruderals and had a low stress tolerance. Synthesis and applications Our findings have important implications for the planning and management of natural ecosystems requiring detailed knowledge of what triggers the presence/absence of individual plant species in a seemingly suitable habitat. We conclude that practitioners may need to carefully consider mycorrhizal inoculations with a suitable assemblage of fungi for certain plant species to become established. Also assisted migration might be necessary to help poor dispersers although spatial and temporal processes are also important to have in mind.

We characterized heating as a function of wavelength, exposure time, and distance from the center of illumination. Although total power is highest near the surface of the brain, heating was most severe hundreds of microns below the focal plane, due to heat dissipation through the cranial window. Continuous illumination of a 1mm2 area produced a peak temperature increase of approximately 1.8°C/100mW.

First we show that hexadecanol acts oppositely to n-alcohol anesthetics on membrane mixing and antagonizes ethanol induced anesthesia in a tadpole behavioral assay. Second, we show that two previously described ‘intoxication reversers’ raise Tc and counter ethanol's effects in vesicles, mimicking the findings of previous electrophysiological and behavioral measurements.  Third, we find that hydrostatic pressure, long known to reverse anesthesia, also raises Tc in vesicles with a magnitude that counters the effect of butanol at relevant concentrations and pressures.

As such, they demand a high level of flowering synchronization. In this scenario, phenology can deepen the effect of density, sex ratio, and distance over fruit production. Also, pollinator reliability can affect a species reproductive success (RS). Pollinator specialist depend on their few pollinators have a high population size; in contrast, generalist (pollinated by many taxa) can surpass this because of their condition. In this paper, we analyzed the effect of phenology, density, distance and pollinator abundance on the female RS of the dioecious palm Chamaedorea pinnatifrons (Palmae) at a cloud forest in Costa Rica. This palm is pollinated by wind and a single species of thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in a mixed pollination system. The pollination system seems to be highly specialized, as the thrips species has been recorded only in flowers of Chamaedorea
Methods: In the 2012 season we monitored the phenology of a population (n = 88 males, 94 females) in a 40x40 plot. All individuals were sexed, mapped, had their height measured and number of leaves counted. RS was measured as the number of fruits/inflorescence and as fruit set. Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) were used to test the effect of flowering time, distance to nearest male, density of males, number of flowers, height, number of leaves and number of flowers over the two response variables. We also estimated thrips population by sampling insects directly from staminate inflorescences in anthesis, from early March to mid-May (11 weeks, n = 33 inflorescences).
Results: Flowering of C. pinnatifrons lasted five months: it began by early February, had a peak by early April, and ended by July. Mean fruit production was 99.7 (± 12.1 SE, min = 0, max = 735). The amount of fruits produced was significantly higher in inflorescences from individuals with shorter stems, had more flowers, a lower flowering synchrony with males and flowered late. Mean fruit set was 0.144 ± 0.016%. Fruit set was also significantly higher in inflorescences from lower stems, with lower male synchrony and flowered late. The mean amount of thrips sampled in staminate inflorescences increased 13-fold between early March (20.8 ± 10.6 thrips/rachillae) and mid-May (282.0 ± 74.4).
Discussion: The higher RS of late flowering plants can be partially explained by the progressive increase in the population of pollinators. Our results in C. pinnatifrons seem to oppose recent analyses in that early flowering plants should be positively selected. A deeper understanding of a species pollination system is necessary to understand the strength of the agents of selection.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1625.pdf,"[( 08 Jun 2016 , 6)]"

With recent advances in sequencing technologies the number of variants identified in TFBSs has increased, hence understanding their role is of significant interest when interpreting next generation sequencing data. Current methods have two major limitations: they are limited to predicting the functional impact of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and often rely on additional experimental data, laborious and expensive to acquire. We propose a purely bioinformatic method that addresses these two limitations while providing comparable results.
 
Results: Our method uses position weight matrices and a sliding window approach, in order to account for the sequence context of variants, and scores the consequences of both SNVs and INDELs in TFBSs. We tested the accuracy of our method in two different ways. Firstly, we compared it to a recent method based on DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing (DHS-seq) data designed to predict the effects of SNVs: we found a significant correlation of our score both with their DHS-seq data and their prediction model. Secondly, we called INDELs on publicly available DHS-seq data from ENCODE, and found our score to represent well the experimental data. We concluded that our method is reliable and we used it to describe the landscape of variation in TFBSs in the human genome, by scoring all variants in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. Surprisingly, we found that most insertions have neutral effects on binding sites, while deletions, as expected, were found to have the most severe TFBS-scores. We identified four categories of variants based on their TFBS-scores and tested them for enrichment of variants classified as pathogenic, benign and protective in ClinVar: we found that the variants with the most negative TFBS-scores have the most significant enrichment for pathogenic variants.

Conclusions: Our method addresses key shortcomings of currently available bioinformatic tools in predicting the effects of INDELs in TFBSs, and provides an unprecedented window into the genome-wide landscape of INDELs, their predicted influences on TF binding, and potential relevance for human diseases. We thus offer an additional tool to help prioritising non-coding variants in sequencing studies.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1626.pdf,"[( 08 Jun 2016 , 17)]"

Specificity and differential binding affinity of HU/IHF proteins towards their target binding sites play a crucial role in their regulatory dynamics. Decades of biochemical and genomic studies have been carried out for HU and IHF like proteins. Yet, questions related to their DNA binding specificity, and differential ability to bend DNA thus affecting the binding site length remained unanswered. In addition, the problem has not been investigated from an evolutionary perspective. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed three major clades belonging to HU, IHFα and IHFβ like proteins with reference to E. coli. We carried out a comparative analysis of three-dimensional structures of HU/IHF proteins to gain insight into the structural basis of clade division. The present study revealed three major features which contribute to differential DNA binding specificity of HU/IHF proteins, I) conformational restriction of DNA binding residues due to salt-bridge formation II) the enrichment  of alanine in the DNA binding site increasing conformational space of flexible side chains in its vicinity and III) nature of DNA binding residue (Arg to Lys bias in different clades) which interacts differentially to DNA bases. Differences in the dimer stabilization strategies between HU and IHF were also observed.

We enrolled young participants who had suffered moderate to severe TBI (N=14, age 13.14 ±  3.25 years), comparing them to young typically developing control participants (N=27, age 15.04 ± 2.26 years).

Altered DNA methylation is common in cancer and often considered an early event in tumorigenesis. However, the sources of heterogeneity of DNA methylation among tumors remain poorly defined. Here, we capitalize on the availability of multi-platform data on thousands of molecularly- and clinically-annotated human tumors to build integrative models that identify the determinants of DNA methylation. We quantify the relative contribution of clinical and molecular factors in explaining within-cancer (inter-individual) variability in DNA methylation. We show that the levels of a set of metabolic genes involved in the methionine cycle that are constituents of one-carbon metabolism are predictive of several features of DNA methylation status in tumors including the methylation of genes that are known to drive oncogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that patients whose DNA methylation status can be predicted from the genes in one-carbon metabolism exhibited improved survival over cases where this regulation is disrupted. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive analysis of the determinants of methylation and demonstrates the surprisingly large contribution of metabolism in explaining epigenetic variation among individual tumors of the same cancer type.

Using C. elegans as a model system, we used a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation library, from the Million Mutation Project, together with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), to rapidly screen for and identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest, namely defects in dye-filling of ciliated sensory neurons. Such anomalies in dye-filling are often associated with the disruption of cilia, organelles which in humans are implicated in sensory physiology (including vision, smell and hearing), development and disease. Beyond identifying several well characterised dye-filling genes, our approach uncovered three genes not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function. From these putative novel dye-filling genes, we confirmed the involvement of BGNT-1.1 in ciliated sensory neuron function and morphogenesis. BGNT-1.1 functions at the trans-Golgi network of sheath cells (glia) to influence dye-filling and cilium length, in a cell non-autonomous manner. Notably, BGNT-1.1 is the orthologue of human B3GNT1/B4GAT1, a glycosyltransferase associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS).

Because the genetic basis of polyphenism switches has only begun to be understood, how their mechanisms arise is unclear. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has a mouthpart polyphenism specialized for alternative diets, a gene (eud-1) executing the polyphenism switch was recently identified as the product of lineage-specific duplications. Here we infer the role of gene duplications in producing a switch gene. Using reverse genetics and population genetic analyses, we examine evidence for competing scenarios of degeneration and complementation, neutral evolution, and functional specialization. Of the daughter genes, eud-1 alone has assumed switch-like regulation of the mouth polyphenism. Measurements of life-history traits in single, double, and triple sulfatase mutants did not, given modest sample sizes and a benign environment, identify alternative or complementary roles for eud-1 paralogs. Although possible roles are still unknown, selection analyses of the sister species and 104 natural isolates of P. pacificus detected purifying selection on the genes, suggesting their functionality by their fixation and evolutionary maintenance.

Loss of peripheral neuronal function at sites distal and disconnected to the central nervous control central centers is well documented. Distal muscular atrophy, complex regional pain symptoms, and poor wound healing are just a few of the many complications with often more severe secondary complications such decubitus ulcers and osteomyelitis seen at sites in the body distal to the center of injury.  MRI has been widely established as a diagnostic and therapeutic planning tool in patients and animal models with neuronal disease. However, studies investigating the neural correlates of spinal cord changes after TBI are lacking. Here, we used T2 MR imaging to determine the effects of mTBI on the morphology and inflammatory changes of the spinal cord. We hypothesize that rats receiving mTBI utilizing a controlled cortical impact (CCI) contusion will demonstrate T2 signal changes at distal locomotor centers in the spine. Experimental mTBI and sham groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used (n = 2 sham and 4 experimental). A mild CCI was applied to the right brain cortex.  Rats were sacrificed at 60 days post injury and spinal cords harvested for ex vivo MRI T2 analysis. Focal areas/lesions of increased T2 hyperintensity were noted in mTBI injured rats (n = 4).  Experimental group of rats also demonstrated secondary spinal cord locomotor and sensation adverse effects clinically.  MR imaging showed volumetric reductions and T2 signal changes in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments of the spinal cord at 8 weeks post-injury. T2 intensity values were elevated in all experimental groups in comparison to the sham group within the distal cord, suggesting that remote CCI causes secondary spinal cord inflammation and neurodegeneration at distant sites.  These findings also further support the idea that the most peripheral nerves and spinal cord will be most negatively affected by a TBI. While our research is in its preliminary stages, our results further confirm that mTBI has more far reaching effects than previously understood.

We conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, in order to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems.

Three composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained they were: (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics- responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for water body size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarizing geology, slope and fractal order- all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and, (iii) topography, i.e. catchment formation type- driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. While driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept.

An. arabiensis is more of a generalist in terms of its host choice and resting behavior, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity and/or segregating allelic variation. To investigate the potential genetic basis of host choice and resting behavior in An. arabiensis we performed a genome-wide association study on host choice (human- or cattle-fed) and resting position (collected indoors or outdoors) in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. This represents the first genomic/molecular analysis of host choice and resting behavior in a malaria vector. We identified a total of 4,820,851 SNPs, which were used to conduct the first genome-wide estimates of 'SNP heritability' for host choice and resting behavior in this species. A genetic component was detected for host choice (human vs cow fed; permuted P = 0.002), but there was no evidence of a genetic component for resting behavior (indoors versus outside; permuted P = 0.465). A principal component analysis (PCA) segregated individuals based on genomic variation into three groups which are characterized by differences at the 2Rb and/or 3Ra paracentromeric chromosome inversions. There was a non-random distribution of cattle-fed mosquitoes between the PCA clusters, suggesting that alleles linked to the 2Rb and/or 3Ra inversions may influence host choice. Using a novel inversion genotyping assay, we detected a significant enrichment of the standard arrangement (non-inverted) of 3Ra among cattle-fed mosquitoes (N=129) versus all non-cattle-fed individuals (N=234; χ2, P=0.007).  Thus, tracking the frequency of the 3Ra in An. arabiensis populations is important, especially in relation to the emergence of behavioral avoidance (e.g. shifting toward cattle-feeding) in some populations.

Understanding how zebrafish MG initiate regeneration may help develop new treatments that prompt mammalian retinas to regenerate.  Here we show that inhibition of GABA signaling facilitates initiation of MG proliferation.  GABA levels decrease following damage, and MG are positioned to detect the decrease.  Using pharmacological and genetic approaches we demonstrate that GABAA receptor inhibition stimulates regeneration in undamaged retinas while activation inhibits regeneration in damaged retinas.

Traditional drug discovery relies on high-throughput screening on reductionist models in order to enable the testing of 105 or 106 compounds. These assays lack the complexity of the human disease. Functional assays overcome this limitation by testing drugs on human tumors, however they can only test few drugs, and remain restricted to diagnostic use. An algorithm that identifies hits with fewer experiments could enable the use of functional assays for de novo drug discovery.
Results: We developed a novel approach that we termed 'algorithmic ideation' (AI) to select experiments, and demonstrated that this approach discovers hits 104 times more effectively than brute-force screening. The algorithm trains on known drug-target-disease associations assembled as a tensor, built from the (public) TCGA and STITCH databases and predicts novel associations. We evaluated our tensor completion approach using a temporal cutoff with data prior to 2012 used as training data, and data from 2012 to 2015 used as testing data. Our approach achieved 104-fold more efficient hit discovery than the traditional brute-force high-throughput screening. We further tested the method in a sparse, low data regime by removing up to 90% of the training data, and demonstrated the robustness of the approach. Finally we test predictive performance on drugs with no previously known interactions, and the algorithm demonstrates 103-fold improvement in this challenging problem. Thus algorithmic ideation can potentially enable targeted antineoplastic discovery on functional assays.

"June 8, 2016",False Discovery Rates: A New Deal.,Biostatistics,"[(Stephens, Matthew,  Univ. of Chicago)]",https://doi.org/10.1101/038216 ,"We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including  
estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences
from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it
assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0.
This ""unimodal assumption"" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into 
standard FDR analysis,
and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits.  Specifically, the UA
facilitates efficient and robust computation -- estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem --
and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds.
Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error),
rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one 
helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of  
effects, and unlike standard FDR methods
our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance.
To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term ""local false sign rate""
to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior
measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and
can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr

At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental profile of ON and OFF RGCs exhibited antagonistic behavior, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed by an increase in the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive field (RF) center sizes decrease, responses to light get stronger, and centers become more circular while seeing differences in all of them between RGC types.

A common theme in nature is diversification via divergent selection with gene flow. Empirical studies on this topic find variable genetic differentiation throughout the genome, that genetic differentiation is non-randomly distributed, and that loci of adaptive significance are often found clustered together within “genomic islands of divergence”. Theoretical models based on new mutations show how these genomic islands can arise and grow as a result of a complex interaction of various evolutionary and genic processes. In the current study, I ask if such genomic islands can alternatively arise from divergent selection from standing genetic variation and I tested this using a simple two locus model of selection. There are numerous ways in which standing genetic variation can be partitioned (e.g., between alleles, between loci, and between populations) and I tested which of these scenarios can give rise to an island pattern compared to no genomic differentiation or complete genomic differentiation. I found that divergent selection, even without reciprocal gene exchange between populations, following a bout of admixture can relatively quickly produce an island pattern. Moreover, I found two pathways in which islands can form from divergence from standing variation: 1) through the build up of islands and 2) through the breakdown of larger, genome-wide differentiation. Lastly, similar to new mutation theory, I found that the frequency of recombination is an important determinant of island formation from standing genetic variation such that mating behavior of a species (e.g., facultative or obligate sexual) can impact the likelihood of island formation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1642.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2016 , 4), ( 08 Jun 2016 , 7)]"

Yet, owing to extensive genetic heterogeneity, multiple modes of inheritance and limited study sizes, sequencing and quantitative genetics approaches have had limited success in characterizing the complex genetics of ASD. Currently, only a small fraction of potentially causal genes -about 65 genes out of an estimated several hundred- are known based on strong genetic evidence. Hence, there is a critical need for complementary approaches to further characterize the genetic basis of ASD, enabling development of better screening and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific functional gene interaction network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism-associated genes, including hundreds of candidate genes for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach is validated in an independent case-control sequencing study of approximately 2,500 families. Leveraging these genome-wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrate that the large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key cellular pathways and specific developmental stages of the brain. Specifically, integration with spatiotemporal transcriptome expression data implicates early fetal and midfetal stages of the developing human brain in ASD etiology. Likewise, analysis of the connectivity of top autism genes in the brain-specific interaction network reveals the breadth of autism-associated functional modules, processes, and pathways in the brain. Finally, we identify likely pathogenic genes within the most frequent autism-associated copy-number-variants (CNVs) and propose genes and pathways that are likely mediators of autism across multiple CNVs.

Many approaches to quantitative trait locus mapping in animal and plant species suffer from limited power and genomic resolution.  Here, I investigate whether bulk segregant analysis (BSA), which has been successfully applied for yeast, may have utility in the genomic era for trait mapping in Drosophila (and other organisms that can be experimentally bred in similar numbers).  I perform simulations to investigate the statistical signal of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in a wide range of BSA and introgression mapping (IM) experiments.  BSA consistently provides more accurate mapping signals than IM (in addition to allowing the mapping of multiple traits from the same experimental population).  The performance of BSA and IM is maximized by having multiple independent crosses, more generations of interbreeding, larger numbers of breeding individuals, and greater genotyping effort, but is less affected by the proportion of individuals selected for phenotypic extreme pools.  I also introduce a prototype analysis method for Simulation-based Inference for BSA Mapping (SIBSAM).  This method identifies significant QTLs and estimates their genomic confidence intervals and relative effect sizes.  Importantly, it also tests whether overlapping peaks should be considered as two distinct QTLs.  This approach will facilitate improved trait mapping in Drosophila and other species for which hundreds or thousands of offspring (but not millions) can be studied.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Genetics/Genetics82.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2016 , 8), ( 13 Jun 2016 , 1)]"

While a number of robust FDR controlling strategies exist, the nature of this error rate is intimately tied to the precise way in which discoveries are counted, and the performance of FDR controlling procedures is satisfactory only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between what scientists describe as unique discoveries and the number of rejected hypotheses. The presence of linkage disequilibrium between markers  in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often leads researchers to consider the signal associated to multiple neighboring SNPs as indicating the existence of a single genomic locus with possible influence on the phenotype. This a posteriori aggregation of rejected hypotheses results in inflation of the relevant FDR. We propose a novel approach to FDR control that is based on pre-screening to identify the level of resolution of distinct hypotheses. We show how FDR controlling strategies can be adapted to account for this initial selection  both with theoretical results and simulations that mimic the dependence structure to be expected in GWAS.

We apply a dictionary compression algorithm to behavioural sequences from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans freely crawling on an agar plate both with and without food and during chemotaxis. We find that the motifs identified by the compression algorithm are rare but relevant for comparisons between worms in different environments, suggesting that hierarchical compression can be a useful step in behaviour analysis. We also use compressibility as a new quantitative phenotype and find that the behaviour of wild-isolated strains of C. elegans is more compressible than that of the laboratory strain N2 as well as the majority of mutant strains examined. Importantly, in distinction to more conventional phenotypes such as overall motor activity or aggregation behaviour, the increased compressibility of wild isolates is not explained by the loss of function of the gene npr-1, which suggests that erratic locomotion is a laboratory-derived trait with a novel genetic basis.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project presents an unprecedented opportunity to address this question due to the availability of deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) and multi-tissue RNA-seq data from 147 individuals. We used comprehensive methods to identify 24,157 high confidence SVs, and mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single nucleotide (SNV) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants. We identified 24,801 eQTLs affecting the expression of 10,101 distinct genes. Based on haplotype structure and heritability partitioning, we estimate that SVs are the causal variant at 3.3-7.0% of eQTLs, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than prior estimates from low coverage WGS and represents a 26- to 54-fold enrichment relative to their scarcity in the genome. Expression-altering SVs also have significantly larger effect sizes than SNVs and indels. We identified 787 putatively causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression, most of which (88.3%) are noncoding variants that show significant enrichment at enhancers and other regulatory elements. By evaluating linkage disequilibrium between SVs, SNVs and indels, we nominate 49 SVs as plausible causal variants at published genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. Remarkably, 29.9% of the common SV-eQTLs are not well tagged by flanking SNVs, and we observe a notable abundance (relative to SNVs and indels) of rare, high impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes.

A sHSP gene family of 33 members is established. Remarkably, roughly half of the members of this family can be explained by nine independent tandem duplication events that evolutionarily determined their functional fates. Within a mitochondrial class subfamily, only one duplicated member, Solyc08g078700, retained its ancestral chaperone function, while the others, Solyc08g078710 and Solyc08g078720, likely degenerated under neutrality and lack ancestral chaperone function.

Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into (1) Kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom-up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short- to long-term), and (2) Integrated effects, where the top-down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes due to temperature from behavioural changes that are the products of constraints, and propose two complementary approaches to help make this distinction and class behaviours according to our framework: (i) behavioural kinetic null modeling and (ii) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature-insensitive mutants.

Here we used numerical simulations to investigate the possibility that it could equally result from the redistribution of pushing forces due to a reorientation of MTs. We first showed that MT gliding along cell edges and pivoting around the centrosome regulate MT rearrangement and thereby direct the spatial distribution of pushing forces, while the number, dynamics and stiffness of MTs determine the magnitude of these forces. By modulating these parameters, we identified different regimes, involving both pushing and pulling forces, characterized either by robust centrosome centering, robust off-centering or 'reactive' positioning. In those latter conditions weak asymmetric cues can induce a misbalance of pushing and pulling forces resulting in an abrupt transition from a centered to an off-centered position. Altogether these results point at the central role played by the configuration of the MTs on the distribution of pushing forces that position the centrosome.

About 10-15 Mya, the ancestral Y chromosome fused to a small autosome (the dot chromosome) in an ancestor of D. pseudoobscura. We used single molecule real-time sequencing reads to assemble the genic part of the D. pseudoobscura dot chromosome, including this Y-to-dot translocation. We find that the intervening sequence between the ancestral Y and the rest of the dot chromosome is only ~78 Kb and has a low repeat density, suggesting that the centromere now falls outside, rather than between, the fused chromosomes. The Y-to-dot region is 100 times smaller than the D. melanogaster Y chromosome, owing to repeat landscape changes. Previous studies suggest that recurrent selective sweeps favoring shorter introns helped to shrink the Y-to-dot following the translocation. Our results suggest that genetic drift and a small ancestral Y chromosome may also help explain the compact size of the Y-to-dot translocation.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1649.pdf,"[( 12 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 11 Jun 2016 , 18)]"

Many biological, chemical, and physical indicators can be used to determine the postmortem interval, but most are not accurate.  Here, we sought to validate an experimental design to accurately predict the time of death by analyzing the expression of hundreds of upregulated genes in two model organisms, the zebrafish and mouse.  In a previous study, the death of healthy adults was conducted under strictly controlled conditions to minimize the effects of confounding factors such as lifestyle and temperature.  A total of 74,179 microarray probes were calibrated using the Gene Meter approach and the transcriptional profiles of 1,063 significantly upregulated genes were assembled into a time series spanning from life to 48 or 96 h postmortem.  In this study, the experimental design involved splitting the gene profiles into training and testing datasets, randomly selecting groups of profiles, determining the modeling parameters of the genes to postmortem time using over- and/or perfectly- defined linear regression analyses, and calculating the fit (R2) and slope of predicted versus actual postmortem times.  This design was repeated several thousand to million times to find the top predictive groups of gene transcription profiles.  A group of eleven zebrafish genes yielded R2 of 1 and a slope of 0.99, while a group of seven mouse liver genes yielded a R2 of 0.98 and a slope of 0.97, and seven mouse brain genes yielded a R2 of 0.93 and a slope of 0.85.  In all cases, groups of gene transcripts yielded better postmortem time predictions than individual gene transcripts.

The authors conducted a simulation study and argued that mvBM outperforms constant variance Brownian motion (BM) when rates of evolution vary across the phylogeny. In this comment, we argue that mvBM is not a viable statistical method because it is fundamentally a circular analysis that overfits phylogenetic branch lengths to the data. We further argue that the comparison of mvBM to BM under conditions where the assumptions of BM are clearly violated is not an informative performance analysis, and that the simulation study of Smaers et al.

With competition for public research funding and career advancement opportunities, animal studies focused on the translational potential may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Such studies often have hastily developed methods with ad hoc modifications including the use of additional animals, leading to considerable amounts of idle, unprocessed data that could be used to advance veterinary science, or to refine the base animal model. Sheep, for example, are poorly understood models of intensive care and therefore, any experimental data arising from them should be interpreted with care. The hypothesis was that there is little information describing the development of methods of physiological data processing in multifaceted sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to develop a suitable data processing method and to analyse the data, once processed.
Methods: Data from 19 adult mechanically ventilated ewes undergoing intensive care in a previous study evaluating a form of extracorporeal life support (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to develop a comprehensive method for processing manual and electronically gathered clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury, and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups.
Results: The analysis revealed that compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury. 
Conclusions: These novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in smoke inhalation animal victims of house and bush fires. A similar data processing method could be used when evaluating the effectiveness of other clinical interventions such as potentially reversible aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis in veterinary patients.

Pyricularia oryzae has a worldwide distribution as a rice (Oryza) pathogen and in the last century emerged as an important wheat (Triticum) pathogen in southern Brazil. Presently, P. oryzae pathotype Oryza is considered the rice blast pathogen, whereas P. oryzae pathotype Triticum is the wheat blast pathogen. In this study we investigated whether the Oryza and Triticum pathotypes of P. oryzae were distinct at the species level. We also describe a new Pyricularia species causing blast on several other poaceous hosts in Brazil, including wheat. We conducted phylogenetic analyses using 10 housekeeping loci from an extensive sample (N = 128) of sympatric populations of P. oryzae adapted to rice, wheat and other poaceous hosts found in or near wheat fields. The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis grouped the isolates into two major monophyletic clusters (I and II) with high Bayesian probabilities (P = 0.99). Cluster I contained isolates obtained from wheat as well as other Poaceae hosts (P = 0.98). Cluster II was divided into three host-associated clades (Clades 1, 2 and 3; P > 0.75). Clade 1 contained isolates obtained from wheat and other poaceous hosts, Clade 2 contained exclusively wheat-derived isolates, and Clade 3 comprised isolates associated only with rice. Our interpretation was that cluster I and cluster II correspond to two distinct species: Pyricularia graminis-tritici sp. nov. (Pgt), newly described in this study, and Pyricularia oryzae (Po). The host-associated clades found in P.  oryzae Cluster II correspond to P. oryzae pathotype Triticum (PoT; Clades 1 and 2), and P. oryzae pathotype Oryza (PoO; Clade 3). No morphological or cultural differences were observed among these species, but a distinctive pathogenicity spectrum was observed. Pgt and PoT were pathogenic and highly aggressive on Triticum aestivum (wheat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Urochloa brizantha (signal grass) and Avena sativa (oats).

Potential applications are broad and ambitious, including the eradication of disease vectors, the control of pest species, and the preservation of endangered species from extinction. Until recently, these possibilities have remained largely abstract due to the lack of an effective drive mechanism. CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive (CGD) now promise a highly adaptable approach for driving even deleterious alleles to high population frequency, and this approach was recently shown to be effective in small laboratory populations of insects. However, it remains unclear whether CGD will also work in large natural populations in the face of potential resistance mechanisms. Here we show that resistance against CGD will inevitably evolve unless populations are small and repair of CGD-induced cleavage via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) can be effectively suppressed, or resistance costs are on par with those of the driver. We specifically calculate the probability that resistance evolves from variants at the target site that are not recognized by the driver's guide RNA, either because they are already present when the driver allele is introduced, arise by de novo mutation, or are created by the driver itself when NHEJ introduces mutations at the target site. Our results shed light on strategies that could facilitate the engineering of a successful drive by lowering resistance potential, as well as strategies that could promote resistance as a possible mechanism for controlling a drive.

In life, genetic and epigenetic networks precisely coordinate the expression of genes -- but in death, it is not known if gene expression diminishes gradually or abruptly stops or if specific genes are involved.  We investigated the unwinding of the clock by identifying upregulated genes, assessing their functions, and comparing their transcriptional profiles through postmortem time in two species, mouse and zebrafish.  We found transcriptional abundance profiles of 1,063 genes were significantly changed after death of healthy adult animals in a time series spanning from life to 48 or 96 h postmortem.  Ordination plots revealed non-random patterns in profiles by time.  While most thanatotranscriptome (thanatos-, Greek defn. death) transcript levels increased within 0.5 h postmortem, some increased only at 24 and 48 h.  Functional characterization of the most abundant transcripts revealed the following categories: stress, immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, transport, development, epigenetic regulation, and cancer.  The increase of transcript abundance was presumably due to thermodynamic and kinetic controls encountered such as the activation of epigenetic modification genes responsible for unraveling the nucleosomes, which enabled transcription of previously silenced genes (e.g., development genes).  The fact that new molecules were synthesized at 48 to 96 h postmortem suggests sufficient energy and resources to maintain self-organizing processes.  A step-wise shutdown occurs in organismal death that is manifested by the apparent upregulation of genes with various abundance maxima and durations.

Despite the biomedical importance of this condition, the system-level mechanisms that alter CD4+ T cell differentiation and plasticity are not well understood. We model how hyperinsulinemia alters the dynamics of the CD4+ T regulatory network, and this, in turn, modulates cell differentiation and plasticity. Different polarizing micro-environments are simulated under basal and high levels of insulin to assess impacts on cell-fate attainment and robustness in response to transient perturbations. In the presence of high levels of insulin Th1 and Th17 become more stable to transient perturbations and their basin sizes are augmented, IL10 producing regulatory T cells become less stable or disappear, while TGFB producing cells remain unaltered. Hence, the model provides a dynamic system-level explanation for the documented apparently paradoxical role of TGFB in both inflammation and regulation of immune responses and the emergence of the adipose Treg phenotype. Furthermore, our simulations provide novel predictions on the impact of the micro-environment in the coexistence of the different cell types, proposing that in pro-Th1, pro-Th2 and pro-Th17 environments effector and regulatory cells can coexist, but that high levels of insulin severely affect regulatory cells, specially in a pro-Th17 environment.

Our results revealed that the Lazarus effect is uncommon, but frequent enough, at ~9% of populations, to be a potent source of evolutionary innovation. Population sequencing uncovered a set of mutations adaptive to lethal 43.0°C that were mostly distinct from those that were beneficial at a high but nonlethal temperature (42.2°).  Mutations within two operons—the heat shock hslUV operon and the RNA polymerase rpoBC operon—drove adaptation to lethal temperature.  Mutations in hslUV exhibited little antagonistic pleiotropy at 37.0°C and may have arisen neutrally prior to subjection to lethal temperature.  In contrast, rpoBC mutations provided greater fitness benefits than hslUV mutants, but were less prevalent and caused stronger fitness tradeoffs at lower temperatures.

Androgens, such as testosterone, are required for androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) growth. Androgen ablation in combination with radiation or chemotherapy remains the primary non-surgical treatment for ADPC. However, androgen ablation typically fails to permanently arrest cancer progression, often resulting in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we analyzed a population of mathematical models that described the integration of androgen and mitogenic signaling in androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer. An ensemble of model parameters was estimated from 43 studies of signaling in androgen dependent and resistant LNCaP cell lines. The model population was then validated by comparing simulations with an additional 33 data sets from LNCaP cell lines and clinical trials. Analysis of the model population suggested that simultaneously targeting the PI3K and MAPK pathways in addition to anti-androgen therapies could be an effective treatment for CRPC. We tested this hypothesis in both ADPC LNCaP cell lines and LNCaP derived CRPC C4-2 cells using three inhibitors: the androgen receptor inhibitor MDV3100 (enzalutamide), the Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Consistent with model predictions, cell viability decreased at 72 hrs in the dual and triple inhibition cases in both the LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines, compared to treatment with any single inhibitor.

In addition, the cellular contexts in which these genomic lesions confer disease risks remain poorly understood.  Here we investigate the use of cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients or unaffected siblings.  Using 24 distinct cell types isolated from the mouse central nervous system, we identified an expression signature shared by genes with likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations detected by exome-sequencing in autism cases.  The signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons.  Based on this signature, we assigned a D score to all human genes to prioritize candidate autism-susceptibility genes.

In order to monitor the impacts that stressors have on freshwater biodiversity, it is important to know the current state of ecosystems and species living in them. This is often hampered by lacking knowledge on species and genetic diversity due to the fact that many taxa are complexes of several morphologically cryptic species. Lacking knowledge on species identity and ecology can lead to wrong biodiversity and stream quality assessments and molecular tools can greatly help resolving this problem. Here, we studied larvae of the caddisfly family Sericostomatidae in the Montseny mountains on the Iberian Peninsula. We expected to find cryptic species and that species would not occur in syntopy due to different ecological niches. We sampled 44 stream sites and sequenced 247 larval specimens for the barcoding region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene. A modeling approach was used to assess the bioclimatic preferences of the found species. Two molecular groups were identified. One could be assigned to Schizopelex furcifera and one to Sericostoma spp. We did find both taxa in syntopy in >50% of sampling sites and could show that the taxa prefer similar bioclimatic conditions. A reexamination of larval specimens showed that Sericostoma and Schizopelex larvae could not be unambiguously identified to the genus level. Overall, our results show the importance of including molecular tools into biodiversity assessments in order to correctly identify the species diversity of a region and to prevent wrong assessment results.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1662.pdf,"[( 09 Jun 2016 , 3)]"

Rather than specifying precise behaviors, sensory information - if at all present - interacts with ongoing neural activity to instruct the organism which type of spontaneous, exploratory behavior to generate. Evaluating the ensuing reafferent feedback modifies the nervous system such that ongoing neural activity patterns become biased towards activity that has generated increased appetitive and decreased aversive feedback in the past. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying both the exploratory, spontaneous behaviors as well as those underlying the modifications caused by the feedback are becoming increasingly understood, even on a molecular level.

Heat shocks of 37C and above result in general inhibition of translation, and severe heat shock (41C) results in sequestration of mRNA in granules. The mRNAs that are bound by the zinc-finger protein ZC3H11, including those encoding refolding chaperones, escape heat-induced translation inhibition.  At 27C, ZC3H11 mRNA is predominantly present as an untranslated cytosolic messenger ribonucleoprotein particle, but after heat shocks of 37C - 41C, the ZC3H11 mRNA moves into the polysomal fraction. To investigate the scope and specificities of heat-shock translational regulation and granule formation, we analysed the distributions of mRNAs on polysomes at 27C and after 1 hour at 39C, and the mRNA content of 41C heat shock granules. We found that that mRNAs that bind to ZC3H11 remained in polysomes at 39C and were protected from sequestration in granules at 41C. As previously seen for starvation stress granules, the mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins were excluded from heat-shock granules. Seventy mRNAs moved towards the polysomal fraction after the 39C heat shock; surprisingly, many of these are also increased when trypanosomes migrate to the Tsetse salivary glands.

Results: To obtain a quantitative estimate of the serial interval for Pf malaria, we took the sum of components of the Pf malaria transmission cycle based on a combination of mathematical models and empirical data. During this process, we identified a number of factors that account for substantial variability in the serial interval across different contexts. Treatment with antimalarial drugs roughly halves the serial interval, seasonality results in different serial intervals at different points in the transmission season, and variability in within-host dynamics results in many individuals whose serial intervals do not follow average behavior.

Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative driver of convergence levels over time. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence among closely related primate species. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, errors in species tree inference can drive these same patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis is undoubtedly affecting many proteins, our results suggest an additional explanation for this widespread pattern.

The use case ending conditions are triggered by the reinterpretation of the diagnostic features of one of 12 type specimens anchoring the corresponding species-level names. Permutations of this child-to-parent reassignment action lead to 36 alternative scenarios, where each scenario requires 1-14 logically contingent nomenclatural emendations. We show that an ASP transition system approach can correctly infer the Code-mandated changes for each scenario, and visually output the ending conditions. The results provide a foundation for further developing logic-based nomenclatural change optimization and compliance verification services, which could be applied in globally coordinated nomenclatural registries. More generally, logic explorations of nomenclatural and taxonomic change scenarios provide a novel means of assessing design biases inherent in the principles of nomenclature, and thus may inform the design of future, big data-compatible identifier systems for systematic products that recognize and mitigate these constraints.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1669.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 15 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 05 Dec 2016 , 1), ( 17 Aug 2017 , 3), ( 14 Jun 2016 , 10)]"

The first property makes it advantageous over the h-index, which does not discriminate between highly and moderately cited articles, while the second property - over the total number of citations, preventing the possibility of overclocking an index by publishing many trivial articles. Contrary to the h-index, which has an upper limit of the total number of publications regardless of their citation numbers, the S-index is not limited by the publication count. This allows scientists having few but very influential works to receive appropriate and respectable index values, which is impossible with the h-index. Moreover, only 10 most cited publications of an individual are typically required to calculate an S-index to 99% accuracy.

These TF DNA binding sites (TFBSs) are usually short (5-15 base pairs) and degenerate (some positions can have multiple possible alternatives). Traditionally, computational methods scan DNA sequences using the position weight matrix (PWM) of a given TF, calculate binding scores for each K-mer against the PWM, and finally classify a K-mer as to whether it is a putative TFBS or a background sequence based on a cut-off threshold. The FSCAN system, which is proposed in this paper, employs machine learning techniques to build a learner model that is able to identify TFBSs in a set of bound sequences without the need for a cut-off threshold. Our proposed method utilizes fuzzy inference techniques along with a distribution-based filtering algorithm to predict the binding sites of a TF given its PWM model and phastCons scores for the input DNA sequences. Data imbalance reduction techniques are also used to ease the learning of the adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm. The proposed system is tested on 22 ChIP-chip sequence-sets from the Saccharomyces Cerevisiae genome.

Here we test the hypothesis that balancing selection may counteract purifying selection in neighboring regions and thus maintain deleterious variants at higher frequency than expected from their detrimental fitness effect. We first show in realistic simulations that balancing selection reduces the density of polymorphic sites surrounding a locus under balancing selection, but at the same time markedly increases the population frequency of the remaining variants, including even substantially deleterious alleles. To test the predictions of our simulations empirically, we then use whole exome sequencing data from 6,500 human individuals and focus on the most established example for balancing selection in the human genome, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our analysis shows an elevated frequency of putatively deleterious coding variants in non-HLA genes localized in the MHC region. The mean frequency of these variants declined with physical distance from the classical HLA genes, indicating dependency on genetic linkage.

Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including placental damage and microcephaly. However, the placenta's role in viral transmission and the mechanisms of microcephaly have not been addressed in primary human tissues. Moreover, there is an urgent need for drugs that can prevent developmental defects following infection. Here, we identify the placental and brain cell populations most susceptible to ZIKV infection, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by inhibiting viral proliferation. In the early gestation placenta, the virus readily infected trophoblast subpopulations that are in direct contact with maternal blood and uterine cells, suggesting routes of ZIKV transmission to the embryo and fetus. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate and brain abnormalities caused by third trimester infection. Blocking a putative viral entry receptor, AXL, which is highly enriched in the infected placenta and brain cell types, reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro. In a glial cell line, the macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, inhibited viral proliferation and viral-induced cytopathic effects at clinically relevant concentrations. Our characterization of infection in primary human tissues clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides critical context for interpreting results from model systems.

We show that when reproductive opportunities are limited by carrying capacity, PCD drives population turnover, providing increased opportunities for phenotypic diversification through stochastic phenotype switching. The main cost of PCD, providing resources for growth to a PCD(-) competitor, is ameliorated by genetic assortment driven by population spatial structure.

These stem cells divide within their niches and differentiate into the constituent cell types of the tissue, and are largely responsible for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mutations can accumulate in stem cell niches and change the rate of stem cell division and differentiation, contributing to both aging and tumorigenesis. Here, we create a mathematical model of the intestinal stem cell niche, crypt system, and epithelium. We calculate the expected effect of fixed mutations in stem cell niches and their expected effect on tissue homeostasis throughout the intestinal epithelium over the lifetime of an organism. We find that, due to the small population size of stem cell niches, fixed mutations are expected to accumulate via genetic drift and decrease stem cell fitness, leading to niche and tissue attrition, and contributing to organismal aging. We also explore mutation accumulation at various stem cell niche sizes, and demonstrate that an evolutionary trade-off exists between niche size, tissue aging, and the risk of tumorigenesis; where niches exist at a size that minimizes the probability of tumorigenesis, at the expense of accumulating deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. Finally, we show that the probability of tumorigenesis and the extent of aging trade-off differently depending on whether mutational effects confer a selective advantage, or not, in the stem cell niche.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Evolutionary Applications/Evolutionary Applications3.pdf,"[( 29 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 07 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 18 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 16 Jun 2016 , 9), ( 11 Jul 2016 , 1)]"

Here we describe foundational genome resources and their application to analysis of germplasm currently in use in West African breeding programs. Resources developed from the African cultivar IT97K-499-35 include bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and a BAC-based physical map, assembled sequences from 4,355 BACs, as well as a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assembly. These resources and WGS sequences of an additional 36 diverse cowpea accessions supported the development of a genotyping assay for over 50,000 SNPs, which was then applied to five biparental RIL populations to produce a consensus genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs. This genetic map enabled the anchoring of 100 Mb of WGS and 420 Mb of BAC sequences, an exploration of genetic diversity along each linkage group, and clarification of macrosynteny between cowpea and common bean. The genomes of West African breeding lines and landraces have regions of marked depletion of diversity, some of which coincide with QTL that may be the result of artificial selection or environmental adaptation.

The objectives of this study were to determine if female V. carolinianus prefer to form aggregations under large cover objects or seek out retreat sites where they would be the sole occupant. Based on past research, we hypothesized that females would form aggregations under large cover objects instead of being the sole occupant.

During laboratory trials, three scorpions were placed in a plywood tray containing sand substrate and three equally-sized large ceramic tiles. The scorpions were left undisturbed for a 24-hour period, after which the tiles were lifted to check for aggregations.  Each group of three scorpions was in the research tray for three consecutive days. Four rounds of aggregation trials were conducted, and t-tests as well as linear regression were used to analyze the data collected. The results of the t-test showed that female V. carolinianus, when given a choice of similarly-sized large cover objects, would select a retreat site where they were the sole occupant; therefore, our initial hypothesis was rejected.

CCs were thought to require high-precision micro-scale features manufactured by photolithography in a cleanroom, which is slow and expensive. Here we present rapidly and inexpensively 3D-printed autonomous CCs. Molds for CCs were fabricated with a benchtop 3D-printer, Poly(dimethylsiloxane) replicas were made, and fluidic functionality was verified with aqueous solutions. We established design rules for 3D-printed CCs by a combination of modelling and experimentation. The functionality and reliability of 3D-printed trigger valves - an essential fluidic element that stops one liquid until flow is triggered by a second liquid - was tested for different geometries and different solutions. Trigger valves with geometries up to 80-fold larger than cleanroom-fabricated ones were found to function reliably. We designed 3D-printed retention burst valves that encode sequential liquid drainage and delivery using capillary pressure differences encoded by varying valve height and width. Using an electrical circuit analogue of the CC, we established circuit design rules for ensuring strictly sequential liquid delivery. We realized a 3D- printed CC with reservoir volumes 60 times larger than cleanroom-fabricated circuits and autonomously delivered eight liquids in a pre-determined sequence in < 7 min, exceeding the number of sequentially-encoded, self-regulated fluidic delivery events previously reported.

Although many researchers have focused on reducing sample preparation costs, few have addressed the first two problems.  Here, we present iTru and iNext, dual-indexing systems for Illumina libraries that help address all three of these issues.  By breaking the library construction process into re-usable, combinatorial components, we achieve low start-up, buy-in, and per-sample costs, while simultaneously increasing the number of samples that can be combined within a single run.  We accomplish this by extending the Illumina TruSeq dual-indexing approach from 20 (8+12) indexed adapters that produce 96 (8x12) unique combinations to 579 (192+387) indexed primers that produce 74,304 (192x387) unique combinations.  We synthesized 208 of these indexed primers for validation, and 206 of them passed our validation criteria (99% success).  We also used the indexed primers to create hundreds of libraries in a variety of scenarios.  Our approach reduces start-up and per-sample costs by requiring only one universal adapter which works with indexed PCR primers to uniquely identify samples.  Our approach reduces buy-in costs because: 1) relatively few oligonucleotides are needed to produce a large number of indexed libraries; and 2) the large number of possible primers allows researchers to use unique primer sets for different projects, which facilitates pooling of samples during sequencing.  Although the methods we present are highly customizable, resulting libraries can be used with the standard Illumina sequencing primers and demultiplexed with the standard Illumina software packages, thereby minimizing instrument and software customization headaches.

Accordingly, monogamy should promote the evolution of worker sterility in social insects when sterile workers make for better helpers. However, a recent population-genetics analysis (Olejarz et al. 2015) found no clear effect of monogamy on worker sterility. Here, we revisit this analysis. First, we relax genetic assumptions, considering not only alleles of extreme effect--encoding either no sterility or complete sterility--but also alleles with intermediate worker-sterility effects. Second, we broaden the stability analysis--which focused on the invasibility of populations where either all workers are fully-sterile or all workers are fully-reproductive--to identify where intermediate pure or mixed evolutionarily-stable states may occur. Finally, we consider additional, demographically-explicit ecological scenarios relevant to worker non-reproduction.

We use a functional definition of cellular state that is based on a mechanistic dynamical systems model of calcium signaling. Using Bayesian parameter inference we obtain high confidence parameter value distributions for several hundred cells, each fitted individually. Clustering the inferred parameter distributions revealed three major distinct cellular states within the population. The existence of distinct cellular states raises the possibility that the observed variability in response is a result of structured heterogeneity between cells.

It is believed that enhancers and promoters are marked by a single chromatin mark each, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. However, other studies have indicated that enhancers and promoters share multiple chromatin marks, including H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27ac. Therefore, we asked whether the epigenetic signatures of these regulatory elements consist of a single mark or multiple marks. Repetitive regions, repeats, are usually ignored. However, we found, in public data, that repeats include about 25% of active enhancers. Thus, we asked how the epigenetic signatures of repetitive and non-repetitive enhancers differ. We studied the four marks in IRM90 (human lung fibroblast) and H1 (human embryonic stem cell). 

Results: Our results show that enhancers and promoters are enriched significantly with the four marks, which form pyramidal signatures. However, the relative lengths of the marks are different. The promoter signature is directional; H3K4me2/3 and H3K27ac tend to be present downstream of the transcription start site; H3K4me1 tends to be present upstream. H1-specific enhancers have a similar signature to IRM90-specific enhancers; however, it is not the case for active promoters of the two cell types. Interestingly, inactive enhancers show a residual signature that resembles the signature of active enhancers. Finally, the epigenetic signature of enhancers found in repeats is identical to that of enhancers found in non-repetitive regions. 

Conclusions: In this study, we characterized the epigenetic signatures of active and inactive enhancers (pyramidal) as well as active promoters (directional-pyramidal) in two cell types. These signatures consist of four chromatin marks that have been reported to be associated with enhancers and promoters. Interestingly, about one quarter of active enhancers are found in repeats. Active enhancers within repeats and those outside repeats have the same epigenetic signature.

The impact of the Near Eastern farmers extended beyond the Near East: farmers related to those of Anatolia spread westward into Europe; farmers related to those of the Levant spread southward into East Africa; farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nature/Nature18.pdf,"[( 29 Aug 2017 , 2), ( 31 Jul 2017 , 1), ( 06 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 13 Nov 2017 , 1), ( 21 Aug 2016 , 3), ( 23 Nov 2017 , 1), ( 18 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 16 Dec 2017 , 2), ( 26 Dec 2016 , 1), ( 27 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 28 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 17 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 11 Mar 2017 , 1), ( 30 Jan 2018 , 3), ( 22 Aug 2017 , 1), ( 16 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 16 Jan 2018 , 1), ( 30 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 04 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 12 Dec 2017 , 6), ( 01 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 24 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 28 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 15 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 23 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 24 Aug 2016 , 2), ( 24 Jul 2017 , 2), ( 15 Jul 2016 , 2), ( 07 Feb 2018 , 2), ( 28 Oct 2017 , 1), ( 03 Jan 2018 , 1), ( 25 Jul 2017 , 1), ( 10 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jul 2017 , 1), ( 09 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 11 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 03 Jun 2017 , 1), ( 11 Dec 2017 , 2), ( 26 Nov 2017 , 4), ( 12 Feb 2017 , 1), ( 27 Nov 2016 , 1), ( 22 Jun 2016 , 5), ( 08 Jun 2017 , 1), ( 22 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 21 Jun 2016 , 13), ( 26 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 30 May 2017 , 1), ( 25 Jun 2016 , 3), ( 26 Oct 2016 , 1), ( 05 Feb 2018 , 1), ( 11 Jan 2018 , 1), ( 14 Dec 2017 , 1), ( 12 Sep 2016 , 2), ( 15 Sep 2016 , 1)]"

RiVIERA-beta identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the 9 autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites. Furthermore, joint modeling the nine immune traits by simultaneously inferring and exploiting the underlying epigenomic correlation between traits further improved the functional enrichments compared to single-trait models.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nucleic Acids Research/Nucleic Acids Research56.pdf,"[( 18 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 17 Jun 2016 , 10)]"

Predominantly practiced method of transgenesis by pronuclear DNA-microinjection is time consuming, tedious and requires highly skilled persons for embryo-manipulation. Testicular electroporation mediated transgenesis requires use of electric current to testis. To this end, we have now developed an innovative technique for making transgenic mice by giving hypotonic shock to male germ cells for the gene delivery. Desired transgene was suspended in hypotonic Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.0) and simply injected in testis. This resulted in internalization of the transgene in dividing germ-cells residing at basal compartment of tubules leading to its integration in native genome of mice.

While Vibrio spp. remained relatively rare in the microbiome of challenged corals, other stress-associated microbial taxa significantly increased in abundance. Contrary to expectations, higher constitutive immunity and more active immune responses did not confer higher resistance to bacterial challenge. Furthermore, more pronounced gene expression responses to bacterial challenge were associated with higher rather than lower mortality. A newly developed gene expression assay based on two genes related to inflammation and immune responses, deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 and a matrix metalloproteinase, predicted mortality under Vibrio treatment both in the initial experiment and in a validation experiment involving another 20 A. millepora genotypes. Instead of mounting more robust responses, resistant corals were largely unaffected by the bacterial challenge and maintained gene expression signatures of healthier condition, including elevated fluorescent proteins and ribosomal biosynthesis along with diminished ubiquitination. Overall, our results support the view that coral disease and mortality is commonly due to opportunistic pathogens exploiting physiologically compromised hosts rather than specific infections, and show, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, that greater immune responses do not necessarily translate into greater disease resistance.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Nature/Nature19.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 4), ( 18 Jun 2016 , 6), ( 20 Jun 2016 , 1), ( 15 Jul 2016 , 1), ( 19 Jun 2016 , 4), ( 30 Jun 2016 , 3)]"

The explosive growth of microbiome research has yielded great quantities of data. These data provide us with many answers, but raise just as many questions. 16S rDNA - the backbone of microbiome analyses - allows us to assess alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and microbe-microbe associations, which characterize the overall properties of an ecosystem. However, we are still unable to use 16S rDNA data to directly assess the microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions that determine that system's broader ecology. Thus, properties such as competition, cooperation, and nutrient conditions remain insufficiently analyzed. Here, we apply predictive community metabolic models of microbes identified with 16S rDNA data to probe the ecology of microbial communities.
Results. We developed a methodology for the large-scale assessment of microbial metabolic interactions (MMinte) from 16S rDNA data. MMinte assesses the relative growth rates of interacting pairs of organisms within a community metabolic network and whether that interaction has a positive or negative effect. Moreover, MMinte's simulations take into account the nutritional environment, which play a strong role in determining the metabolism of individual microbes. We present two case studies that demonstrate this software's utility. In the first, we show how diet influences the nature of the microbe-microbe interactions. In the second, we use MMinte's modular feature set to better understand how the growth of Desulfovibrio piger is affected by, and affects the growth of, other members in a simplified gut community under metabolic conditions suggested to be determinant for their dynamics. 
Conclusion. By applying metabolic models to commonly available sequence data, MMinte grants the user insight into the metabolic relationships between microbes, highlighting important features that may relate to ecological stability, susceptibility, and cross-feeding. These relationships are at the foundation of a wide range of ecological questions that impact our ability to understand problems such as microbially-derived toxicity in colon cancer.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/BMC Bioinformatics/BMC Bioinformatics34.pdf,"[( 20 Jun 2016 , 7), ( 18 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 19 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 17 Jun 2016 , 8)]"

Despite a few cases that are clearly functionally important, the biological significance of most nonsynonymous editing sites in animals remains largely unknown.  Recently, genome-wide A-to-I editing was found to occur mainly in the coding regions and specifically during sexual reproduction in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum that lacks ADAR orthologs.  In this study, we found that both the frequency and editing level of nonsynonymous editing is significantly higher than those of synonymous editing, suggesting that nonsynonymous editing is generally beneficial and under positive selection in F. graminearum.  We also showed that nonsynonymous editing favorably targets functionally more important and more conserved genes, but at less-conserved sites, indicating that the RNA editing system is adapted to fine turn protein functions by avoiding potentially deleterious editing events.  Furthermore, nonsynonymous editing in F. graminearum was found to be under codon-specific selection and most types of codon changes tend to cause amino acid substitutions with distinct physical-chemical properties and smaller molecular weights, which likely have more profound impact on protein structures and functions.  In addition, we found that the most abundant synonymous editing of leucine codons is adapted to fine turn the protein expression by increasing codon usage bias.  These results clearly show that A-to-I RNA editing in fungi is generally adaptive and recoding RNA editing may play an important role in sexual development in filamentous ascomycetes.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1691.pdf,"[( 19 Jun 2016 , 8)]"

This stems from two functions of endogenous serotonin activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not currently adaptive and driving plasticity to reconfigure them. These mirror dual functions of dopamine in invigorating reward-related responses and promoting plasticity that reinforces new ones. However, while dopamine neurons are known to be activated by reward prediction errors, consistent with theories of reinforcement learning, the reported firing patterns of serotonin neurons do not accord with any existing theories. Here, we used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a genetically-defined population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, thus reporting the kind of surprise signal proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Together, these findings show how the firing patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility and suggest a revised model of dopamine-serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications.",/Users/lynnyi/Documents/Projects/biorxiv-data-mining/downloads/Pre print/Pre print1692.pdf,"[( 21 Jun 2016 , 9), ( 28 Jul 2016 , 3), ( 04 Aug 2016 , 1), ( 20 Jun 2016 , 2), ( 19 Jun 2016 , 16), ( 27 Aug 2016 , 4), ( 17 Jul 2016 , 6)]"

Previous research has shown that circuits based on integrases can perform a variety of functions, including counters, Boolean logic operators, memory modules and temporal event detectors. It is therefore essential to develop a principled theoretical and experimental framework for the design, implementation and study of such circuits. One of the fundamental questions that such a framework should address concerns the functionality limitations and temporal dynamics of the integrases as regulatory elements. Here, we test the functionality of several large serine integrases from a recently published library in a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) platform. Additionally, we use a combination of experimental data and models to investigate integrase dynamics as a function of enzyme concentration and number of binding sites. 
We report that sequestration of integrase molecules, either in the form of monomers or dimers, by the integrase's own binding sites dominates integrase dynamics, and that the delay in the activation of the reporter is negatively correlated with integrase plasmid concentration. We have validated our sequestration hypothesis by building a model with MATLAB's SimBiology toolbox, and running simulations with various integrase and binding sites concentrations.

Here, we characterized the genomic basis of this adaptation in both coral hosts and their intracellular algal symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) using genome-wide gene expression profiling and gene coexpression network analysis. Inshore and offshore coral populations differ primarily in their capacity for gene expression plasticity: upon transplantation to a novel environment inshore corals were able to match expression profiles of the local population significantly better than offshore corals. Furthermore, elevated plasticity in expression of environmental stress response (ESR) genes was adaptive in the inshore environment: it correlated with the least susceptibility to a natural summer bleaching event, whereas higher constitutive ESR gene expression (""frontloading"" sensu Barshis et al. 2013) did not.

Unfortunately, the potential of this data to bring new insights is limited by the effects of individual study-specific biases due to small number of biological samples. Increasing sample size by direct microarray data integration increases the statistical power to obtain a more precise estimate of gene expression in a population of individuals resulting in lower false discovery rates. However, despite numerous recommendations for gene expression data integration, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of different processing approaches aimed to asses microarray platforms diversity and ambiguous probesets to genes correspondence, leading to low number of studies applying integration.
Results: Here, we investigated five different approaches of the microarrays data processing in comparison with RNA-seq data on breast cancer samples. We aimed to evaluate different probesets annotations as well as different procedures of choosing between probesets mapped to the same gene. We show that pipelines rankings are mostly preserved across Affymetrix and Illumina platforms. BrainArray approach based on updated annotation and redesigned probesets definition and choosing probeset with the maximum average signal across the samples have best correlation with RNA-seq, while averaging probesets signals as well as scoring the quality of probes sequences mapping to the transcripts of the targeted gene have worse correlation. Finally, randomly selecting probeset among probesets mapped to the same gene significantly decreases the correlation with RNA-seq.
Conclusion: We show that methods, which rely on actual probesets signal intensities, are advantageous to methods considering biological characteristics of the probes sequences only and that cross-platform integration of datasets improves correlation with the RNA-seq data. We consider the results obtained in this paper contributive to the integrative analysis as a worthwhile alternative to the classical meta-analysis of the multiple gene expression datasets.
